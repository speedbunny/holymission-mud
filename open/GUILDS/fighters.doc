The details of each ability:

STRONGHOLD
   available for: level 10 and up
   sp cost:       10 points
   effect:        Teleports player to guildhall, with all equipment
                  and money.

HEAD-BUTT
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        One extra attack per heartbeat. Requires the possession
                  of a helmet (needs not be worn). Gives xp equal to damage 
                  done. There is a small chance of doing extreme damage 
                  (vicious hit). If the but command is repeated within same 
                  heart_beat the player can hurt himself a little. It is 
                  possible to use but in combination with berzerk.
   formulas:
      normal but  -> damage = level/2 + 15 points (NOT random(...))
      vicious hit -> chance of occurrance = 1 in (30 - level) * 40
      vicious hit -> damage = level/2 + 15 + level*20 points
      hurt yourself for: random(4) - ac of helmet.

MUNCH
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Eat corpses for some healing.
   formula:       heal = random(weight of corpse + 1)

COMPARE
   available for: level 16 and up
   sp cost:       20 points
   effect:        Compares the wc of 2 weapons or the ac of two armours
                  It tells which one is best, without revealing actual
                  numbers. Results are given as better, equally good, or
                  worse (not how much better or worse). The player must 
                  carry both items for successful comparison.

BERZERK
   available for: level 20 and up
   sp cost:       40 points
   effect:        From level 20 -> 1 extra weapon attack, 
                  from level 25 -> 2 extra weapon attacks.
                  The berzerk lasts for 60 seconds, or until the
                  player wimpies away, whichever occurs first.
   formulas:  
      berzerk damage = random(((player's wc + weapon's hit)*2 +
                                player's stat_dam) /3)
      
   For reasonable comparison I've given the formula for damage
   done in normal weapon combat below:
      normal  damage = random((player's wc + weapon's hit +
                               player's stat_dam) / 2)

CHECK
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Compares wc, ac, current hp and level of an npc
                  with the player's own. Results are given in a 
                  descriptive way, to conceal what stats are really
                  checked. Gives just better or worse as results.

RESCUE
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Makes a monster attack you instead of a fellow
                  player. Fellow player must be in combat first.
   formula:       chance of success = (2*level + 30) %

FIGHTER line
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Send messages to all other fighters. Without message it
                  shows the names of all fighters that are logged in. 
                  Fighter line can not be shut off.

SPELLS
   Fighters can not use the common spells missile, shock and fireball.


GUILD SUPPORTS
   One must have a str of at least 8 to be able to join.

   Fighters have the option of getting a free sword and mantle
   at the guild. This weapon and armour grow better with level.
   The sword and mantle self-destruct when dropped.
   Bastard sword:
      class = (level + str)*2/6 + 3
      weight is calculated according to obj/weapon!
   Mantle:
      class = level/5 + 2
      weight = 1


HIT AND SPELL POINTS
   The formulas for these are:
   MAX_HP = 30 + 19 * con
   MAX_SP = 47 +  3 * int


SAMPLE VALUES TABLE
   Here are some stats shown for various level fighters. Where
   the values are dependent on stats (str, int, con), the stats
   are considered to be equal to the level.
