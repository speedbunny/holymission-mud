*** WARNING ***
  - Jedi guild soul does NOT have a time_guild_soul() function. Although 
    some abilities got a delay built in lately, it's still possible to
    make some dreadful deadly aliases. Uglymouth. -

Here follow the details of each ability:

ACTIONS IN THE DARK
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Jedis can use normal 'inventory', 'look', 'put', 'get' 
                  and 'give' commands in dark rooms as if the player were
                  in daylight. 'Look' also tells if there are invisible
                  objects in the room, but not any details of that object.

JUDGE
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Gives details about livings and items. An indication of 
                  how good the living or item is, is given, usually devided 
                  in 8 levels (descriptive). 
                  Details of livings are absolute (not compared to the 
                  player's stats). The following stats are checked:
                   - name, 
                   - alignment (descriptive), 
                   - race,
                   - max_hp (each level = 60 points),
                   - shape (descriptive, as in prompt),
                   - ac (each level = 2 points),
                   - wc (each level = 3 points).
                  Of items, the following details are given:
                   - short_desc,
                   - type (weapon, armour, container, food, drink or other),
                   - ac (if armour, each level = 2 points),
                   - wc (if weapon, each level = 3 points),
                   - weight (each level = 1 point).

CURE
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       wounds:         variable, equal to amount of healing.
                  poison/alcohol: 2 * poison strength + 2 * intox level/3.
   hp cost:       poison/alcohol: 10 (if hp > 10).
   effect:        Heals a certain amount of hp, or cures poison and 
                  intoxination. Wounds can be healed in levels.
                  If you want to heal more wounds than is necassary to 
                  get to max_hp, a different healing formula is used.
   formulas:       
      Wounds:
         light    wounds heals 30% of max_hp, 
         serious  wounds heals 50% of max_hp,
         critical wounds heals 90% of max_hp,
                  wounds heals sp - 20.
         If heal asked is too high:
         heal = max_hp - sp - 20.
      Poison/alcohol:
         removes all poison and halves intox level.
  
   [Note: Weird formulas! I suppose that 'heal wounds' should heal (hp - 20)
    points, instead of (SP - 20). If too high heal asked then the better
    your mental condition, the worse you heal...!? Uglymouth.]

FIND living
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Gives the long() of the room the living is in, even
                  if that room is dark. Tells if the living is a player.

JEDI line
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Sends message to all guild members that are listening
                  to the guild line. Without message it shows the names
                  of all jedis logged in and if they are listening to the
                  guild line or not. This command toggles guild line ON/OFF.

PARRY
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       1 sp per 5 seconds.
   effect:        Gives the player an extra (invisible) armour of type
                  'guild'. The parry can be stopped voluntary, or whenever
                  spell points drop below 30. After parry is stopped, it
                  can not be used again within a certain period of time.
   formulas:
      ac of the parry_armour     = dex/5 + level/10 + 3
      time parry can not be used = 300 - level * 5 seconds

   [note: Normal sp healing = 3 points per 30 seconds, so effective cost
    is 3 sp per 30 seconds. There is an integer retime = 60 + level * 5,
    that does nothing. Could it have been intended for calculating maximum 
    duration of parrying? Uglymouth.]

BOLT
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       30 + level - int/5
   effect:        Gives a non-lethal electrical shock to a living. Can be
                  used to start a fight, as well as during one.
   formulas:      damage = 15 + level/3 + wis points, OR:
                  damage = (hp of target)/2, if damage > hp of target.

   [Note: In rare cases this attack might be lethal, because the 
    reduce_hit_point(damage) and hit_player(1) (only used to start a fight)
    are in the wrong order. Uglymouth.]

LIGHTNING (prepare L, free L, spread L)
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       variable, equal to (damage built up that round)/2
   effect:        Cast a lightning bolt at either one living, or all other
                  npcs in the same room. Can alternatively be used to
                  destruct corpses. Can be used to start a fight or
                  while fighting. It takes one second after the release
                  command before it really is released. When released, the
                  player and target must be in the same room. If the energy 
                  level is built up too high, the lightning is released 
                  uncontrolled. If not prepared, lightning just gives flashy 
                  show effects.
   formulas:
      player's level -->          [ 1- 9] [10-14] [15-19] [20-24] [ 25+ ]
      damage built up each round     5       7       9      12      17
           + random(8) per round
      time till next round           6       4       4       2       2
      max # rounds of control        3       6       6       9       9
      
      'Free'   damage (one living)  = full built up damage.
      'Spread' damage (all npcs)    = 3 * full damage / # npcs / 2
                                        + random(7) points.
      If uncontrolled player is hit for: full damage/10 + 5 points, and 
         the target is not hit.
      If sp < 30:   
         if fighting, the one target is hit for full damage built up so far,
         otherwise the lightning aborts harmlessly.

   [Note: The 'free lightning' command uses reduce_hit_point and thus 
    should not be lethal. However, it is followed by hit_player(1) to 
    start a fight. This might kill the target. 'Spread lightning' uses 
    only hit_player(dmg). Uglymouth.]

SUGGEST <ability>
   'Suggest' itself doesn't do anything but call the right ability.

SUGGEST NOATTACK
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Stops fight in all livings that are attacking the player.
                  The power takes effect one second after the command is 
                  given.
   formula:
      success if: chr of living < chr + 10 * level.

SUGGEST FEAR
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Makes one or all livings in the same room run_away. This
                  abilitiy does not affect other jedis.
   formula:
      success if: wisdom of living < wis + 10.

SUGGEST DISCORD
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       level * 3
   effect:        Makes all livings that are attacking the player, attack
                  another living in the same room.
   formula:
      chance of failure (per attacker) = 2 : # people in room * 3, 
         given there is someone else to attack. People in room includes
         player and attacker.

SUGGEST WEAK
   avalable for: all levels
   sp cost:       10 + level * 3 - wis    if successful, or
                 (10 + level * 3 - wis)/3 if failed.
   effect:       weakens the opponent's weapon class for some time.
   formulas:
      lowers target's wc by (level/25 * 30) %,
      weak lasts for: (chr * 2 - chr of target) seconds.

SUGGEST BRAINSTORM
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       10 + level * 3 - wis
   effect:        Gives a very effective last blow to an already hurt
                  opponent.
   formulas:
      requires: hp of target < 10 % of max_hp of target
      chance of success = chr %
      damage = random(1000) points

SPELLS
   Jedis are not able to use the common missle, shock and fireball spells.


GUILD SUPPORT
   Requirements for joining are:
      - one may not be an dwarf, orc or troll,
      - one must have an alignment < -100, or > +100.

   Jedis can get a free lightsaber and cape at their guildhall. The 
   lightsaber gets better with level. Cape and lightsaber selfdestruct
   in 30 seconds after dropping (can be picked up again within that time).
   Lightsaber:
      class = 5,
      magic_hit = level/2 points, but requires sp level >= 20,
      if the lightsaber is wielded, it gets activated automatically when
         the player is attacked.
   Cape:
      armour_class = 1,
      type = 'robe' (not 'guild', because parry_armour was chosen for that).

   [Note: There is an integer 'count' in the lightsaber, that probably
    should have been used to drain sp or otherwise calculate the maximum
    time you can use the magic_hit. It doesn't. Uglymouth]


HIT POINTS AND SPELL POINTS
   Those are as defined in the guild/master (not modified in the guildroom):
      MAX_HP = 39 + 11 * con
      MAX_SP = 39 + 11 * int
