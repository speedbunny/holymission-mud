*** IMPORTANT NOTE: ***
    - I have found some situations in which one formula overrules another
    formula, or where one formula seems to be used where in fact another
    one is actually used! As much as possible I have written down here 
    the formulas as they really work and put notes where things might
    have become a bit unclear. Uglymouth. -

Some abilities can only be done if three conditions are met. The
conditions are: 
   * intoxination level < str*3 / 2 + 20,  
   * not wearing armour that hinders the ability (see CHECK),
   * this heart_beat not being busy with another ability that 
     interferes with this one.
The abilities that are dependent of those conditions are marked with
a '(+)' after its name.
Here follow the details of each ability:

FIX
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Monks have an improved natural_ac and natural_wc, which
                  allows them attack without weapon and still do good 
                  damage. This command sets n_ac and n_wc to monk values.
   formulas:      Natural_wc = dex/2 + 3   
                     OR:       n_wc = 25 if dex == 40
                  Natural_ac = dex/6 + 3, OR:       
                  Natural_ac = dex/6 + 3 + wis/4 if concentrated on aikido.
                  
   [Note: there is a thrid possible formula, that does work in aikido
    (see AIKIDO), but not in fix: natural_ac = dex/6 + 3 + wis/4 + dex/10
    if concentrated on aikido and dex > 34. Uglymouth.]

   I wanted to include the formulas for normal natural_ac and natural_wc
   values, but they are nowhere to be found. Thus I took the empirical way:
   most players have both with a value 0. But I have seen some with higher
   values, up to 8 (mostly for natural_ac).

VITALS
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Gives a detailed list of the player's status. In this 
                  list are given:
                  * current feetcondition and max feetcondition (see FEET)
                    (numbers),
                  * xp needed for next level (number),
                  * power (a stat, defined as (wis * dex)/6 ) (number),
                  * money carried (number),
                  * physical health status (descriptive, as in prompt),
                  * mental   heatlh status (descriptive, as in prompt),
                  * intoxination level (descriptive),
                  * if player is concentrated on aikido or not.

   [Note: The descriptions given at intox info are mostly dependent on
    the level of the player. They have nothing to do with the maximum
    intoxination level allowed for certain abilities. Uglymouth.]

RUNAWAY
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Teleport to guildhall. Player drops all items first.

MEDITATE
   availabe for: all levels
   sp cost:      none
   effect:       Faster regeneration of hp and sp. The player can take
                 no physical action while meditating. Whispering and
                 checking stats is possible.
   formulas:
      Heal = 2 + int/3 points per call_out, OR:
      Heal = 2 + con/3 points per call_out, if int > con.

   For comparison, normal healing goes at the following rate:
      3 hp and 3 sp every 30 seconds.

CHECK
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Check if an armour hinders other guild abilities.
                  Monks CAN wear the armour and gain its ac, but while
                  wearing it, some abilities can not be used.

PERCEPTION (+)
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Compares level, hp, ac and wc of a living with those
                  of the player. Results are descriptive to conceal which
                  stats are actually checked. Level gives some info about
                  how much better or worse the opponent is. The other 
                  stats give just better, equal or worse as result.

MONK
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       3 points
   effect:        Sends a message to all monks that listen to the guild
                  line (see SILENCE). Without message it gives names, 
                  levels, genders, races of all guildmembers logged in, 
                  and also if they listen to your level of the guild line.

MT (monk tell) (+)
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       2 points
   effect:        Exept for the prompt MT is exactly the same as the 
                  'tell' command. 
                  
SILENCE
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Shuts off all shouts and guild line messages sent by
                  others of your level and lower, using the earmuff hook.
                  Silence can be set on any level up to the players own.

PENTAGRAM 
   available for: level 8 and up
   sp cost:       60 points
   effect:        Draw a portable pentagram that can teleport a 
                  non-guild member to the inner guildrooms once.

CURE (+)
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       30 points
   effect:        Cures livings other than the player self 40 hp or up to
                  max_hp, if that takes less than 40 points to heal. This
                  costs the recipient 10 - 40 sp.

   [Note: this trick should have cost the recipient a standard amount of
    10 sp (it's checked if he has them). But because heal_self() and
    restore_spell_points are in the wrong order, it has become 10 - 40
    points -> one may end up with -30 sp. Uglymouth.]

DISCHARGE (+)
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none
   effect:        Transfers spell points from a living to the player.
                  The living can react with either attack or flight.
                  Discharge blocks other (+) abilities that heart_beat.
   formulas:
      Let L[stat] = a stat of the living.
      Requires:   L[sp] > L[max_sp] - L[lvl * 2]
      Success if: L[sp] >      (( (chr * wis * L[sp]) / (8 * L[wis] * L[int]) 
                                  + chr + 4) * 3 )
      Sp transferred on success = (chr * wis * L[sp]) / (8 * L[wis] * L[int])
                                  + chr + 4
      Sp transferred on failure = L[sp] / 4
      Living flees if: L[chr] <= random(chr * 2), otherwise it attacks. 

   [Note: It is NOT possible to calculate a relation between the amount
    of sp required in the living and the chance of success/the amount
    of sp transferred, because sp is independent of wis and chr. So it is
    very probable that this will give impossible situations, like failure 
    to discharge transfers more sp than succes, or illegal values, like very
    negative sp for the victim (I checked, both can occur). Uglymouth.]

AIKIDO (+)
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       8 + wis/4
   effect:        Improves the natural_ac of the player for a certain time.
   formulas:      N_ac improves by wis/4, 
                     OR: if dex > 34 then
                  N_ac improves by (wis/4 + dex/10). 
                  The aikido lasts for 400 + (wis * 8) seconds. 

CHARM (+)
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       8 + int
   effect:        If the victim (a living) has a wielded weapon, its weapon 
                  is unwielded and it is forced to stop fighting (if it
                  was fighting). However, the charm increases the victim's 
                  natural_wc. The charm is blocked by any feet attack that
                  heart_beat (even if it didn't result in a block. See FEET).
   formulas:      
      The charm fails only if:            
                 chr * 3   <=         L[chr]   OR if:
         random( chr * 3 ) <= random( L[chr] ) OR if:
         gender == L[gender] && random(100) < 40.
      The victim's natural_wc is increased by
         3/2 * L[wc],   OR: by
         3/2 * L[n_wc], whichever of the two is lower.

FEET (+)
   available for: all levels
   sp cost:       none (0 or 2 points feet_condition)
   effect:        One extra attack per heart_beat. If dex < 20 there is a
                  chance that feet hinders other (+) abilities. Feet uses
                  its own stat, called feet_condition. If feet_condition
                  drops below 0, no more feet attacks are possible until
                  healed. Feet gives xp equal to the damage done. You can 
                  use feet to start a fight as well as during a fight.
   formulas:
      Feet blocks other (+) abilities if: random(20) > dex 
         (meaning that they can be done too, after the feet attack in 
         the SAME heart_beat (through an alias) if it does NOT block).
      Feet costs 3 points feet_condition per attack, but also 
           heals 1 point  feet_condition per heart_beat.
      Max_feet_condition = con * 10.
      Chances of possible results are:
         2 : 11   nothing happens (it just returns 1),
         4 : 11   miss target,
         2 : 11   hit  target for:     random((wis + dex)/3 + 6) points,
         2 : 11   hit  target for: 2 * random((wis + dex)/3 + 6) points,
         1 : 11   hit  target for: 6 * random((wis + dex)/3 + 6) points.

   [Note: Max_feet_condition is defined twice (in the initial reset and
    in the time_guild_soul). Although it might initially be much higher,
    it's corrected after the first hard_beat. Uglymouth.]

CHOKE (+)
   available for: all levels (only if stats are high enough)
   sp cost:       dex/3 + 8 points
   effect:        One extra attack per heart_beat. Gives xp equal to
                  the damage done. Choke blocks other (+) abilities. You
                  can use choke to start a fight, as well as during a fight.
   formulas:
      Required: Power (== wis * dex / 6) >= 5.
      Result = hit victim for: dex/3 + random(20) points.
   
   For reasonable comparison: a player with his stats equal to his level
      can do a choke attack from level 6 and up and does an average of
      11 points of damage at that level.

SMASH (+)
   available for: all levels (only if stats are high enough)
   sp cost:       20 + int points
   effect:        One extra attack per heart_beat, which also HOLDs the
                  victim for a certain period of time. Smash can only be
                  performed on victims of sizes 2, 3 and 4 (not on tiny
                  or huge monsters). Smash blocks other (+) abilities.
                  Gives xp equal to the damage done. You can use smash to
                  start a fight, as well as during a fight.
   formulas:
      Required: Power (== wis * dex / 6) >= 15.
      Chances of success:
         if level < 4 -> always fails (although one CAN do the action),
         if level > 9 -> always succeeds,
         otherwise succes if: level > 4 + random(6).
      Result: hit  victim for: dex + random(45) points,
              HOLD victim for: 4 + wis/6 seconds.
   
   For reasonable comparison: a player with his stats equal to his level
   can do a smash attack from level 10 and up, doing an average of
   32 points of damage at that level and HOLDing the victim for 5 seconds.

DEATH (+)
   available for: all levels (only if stats are high enough)
   sp cost:       30 + wis + dex     points
   hp cost:       random(10 + con/2) points
   effect:        One extra attact per heart beat. Death blocks other 
                  (+) abilities. Gives xp equal to the damage done. You 
                  can use death to start a fight, as also while fighting.
   formulas:
      Required: Power (== wis * dex / 6) >= 30.
      Chances of success:
         if level < 8  -> always fails (although one CAN do the action),
         if level > 14 -> always succeeds,
         otherwise success if: level > 8 + random(8).
      Result: hit victim for:  60 + random((wis + dex) *3) points.

   For reasonable comparison: a player with his stats equal to his level
   can do a smash attack from level 14 and up, doing an average of
   101 points of damage at that level.


Monks are not able to use the common missile, shock and fireball spells.

GUILD SUPPORT
Monks guild has the following requirements for joining:
 - One may not be an Orc or Troll or be of neuter gender.
 - If one is a male   dwarf,  he has to do: 
       shadowquest and ratsquest.

This guild has a small change to get 1-2 extra attacks, depending
on the dex of it's member.
if(dex + random(30     )) > random( 88) extra_attack_1; if e_a_1:
if(      random(dex    )) > random(100) extra_attack_2; if e_a_2:
if(      random(dex * 2)) > random(200) extra_attack_3;


HIT POINTS AND SPELL POINTS

max_hp = 38 + con * 11.
max_sp = 38 + int * 11.


TABLE OF EXPAMPLE VALUES

For purposes of reference, I assumed that the players used for this 
table have stats equal to their level (last column: all stats 35),
and attack monsters of equal level (last column: level 35), with 
stats equal to their level.
