command: join
no arguments

Every guild knows the process of joining. At some guilds joining is free,
others require fees or special skills before joining. Leaving guilds is 
very restrictive. Where low level players might change guilds and play around
with their new abilities, high levels players are will be severly punished
for leaving, even with death.
