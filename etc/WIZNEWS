Starting at the end of March 1999, the arches will begin a quarterly

Promotions will be given out at the end of each quarter.

===============================

  Wizards are like lawyers, and can find loop holes in any Law so this is the
thought of the MUD: COMMON SENSE... if it doesn't seem to make sense, DON'T
DO it. Mail a Arch or Higher and ask... OR banishment might befall you.
