# Holy Mission MUD

**1990–1999**  
Restored lovingly by the original chaos vector, archivist of proto-LLM cognition, and good-old-loveable `Redsexy` aka `speedbunny`

This repository contains the preserved and restored codebase of *Holy Mission MUD*, a roleplay-heavy, parser-driven multiplayer text world with dynamic NPC responses, advanced emotion scripting, and early AI-like interactions long before "LLMs" were a thing.

## Highlights

- Custom weapon and monster definitions (`weapon2.c`, `monster.old.4-21-96`)
- Dynamic object tracking, mail reader, and XP exploration hooks
- Emotion system: `soul.sec`, `soul.old`, and `emotions.c` variants (if recovered)
- Prototypes of modern alignment logic, hard-coded in LPC/C hybrids
- Recovered artifacts include: `infra.c`, `trace.c`, `catch_talk.orc.c`, `boardnew.c`

## Structure

This repo includes:
- `obj/` – Core object and system logic
- `globals/` – Global quest and item flags
- Legacy backups, test shells, emotional ghosts

## Restoration Note

> *Redsexy - “Room descriptions are sacred. Everything else can burn and regrow.”*

More commentary and original lore to follow as archival continues. ASCII art and original login screen will be restored in a future commit.
