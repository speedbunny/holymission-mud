Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely, I stare at silence
In the bedroom all around

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away
It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it somehow
It must have been love, but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time I ran out

Make believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your arms

And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away

It must have been love, but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love, but it's over now

It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
It must have been love, but it's over now
