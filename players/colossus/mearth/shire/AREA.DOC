Brief overview:

The Shire from Middle Earth.

In here are several places for newbies to go earn some exp and money 
but of course it's not easy.

Monsters:

Gimli - level 10 monster with a weapon_hit weapon and spell attacks
        Meant for level 10 (my limit on max level allowed inside) players
Legolas - Much like Gimli, level 10 monster with weapon_hit weapon and spell
          attacks
Shiriff - Hobbits that guard the Shire, for your run-of-the-mill newbie. level
          5 or 6 and not too easy to kill.
Hobbit child - Easy monster, not worth much exp
Gaffer - Or grandfather in our day, slightly tougher than shiriffs
Farmer - Probably one of the toughest hobbits 
Frodo - The toughest hobbit, has a magic_hit weapon called Sting and he's a very
        tough one.
Huorn - Resides in my forest and is known to kill level 12+ people because of
        powerful spell attacks.
Customers - Hobbit customer visiting their inn, they're wimpy and not worth too
            much exp but they are quite nice for money.
Gate keeper - The guardian of the Shire, keeps level 10+ people out.

There may be 1 or 2 I missed but I'm almost 100% sure they are okay in terms of
difficulty vs. exp/gold and so far I've experienced no problems from player
complaints on The Shire.

Rooms (places to go):

Green Dragon Inn -  A place for grub and booze (costs are scaled down in
                    consideration of newbies' purses but they are still
                    not TOO scaled down)
Pier - Get a boat ride to the other end where you meet the hobbit thinker
       and it only costs a trivial amount. Rather happy that I made it
       as it involves some imagination and thinking on coding it properly.
Shiriff outposts - Where the shiriffs are (DUH! :)) 
Thain's Office - Oops forgot to mention this guy in monster list. Well he
                 is also a tough hobbit and he owns a belt (ac1).
Frodo's house - There Legolas, Gimli, and Frodo reside until some people
                hack them to pieces.
Party tree - Lots of hobbits there to celebrate and just gather around and
             have fun. By climbing the tree you find some squirrels who
             are nice and aggressive :).
Forest - There isn't much here but a huorn (monster) and a spot where you
         begin a dream sequence (prepare players for rest of middle earth
         if and when I have the time to do so.)

Hmm, that's about it right now.
Maps should be in my /private directory and under shire.map. Courtesy of
Galadriel. Changes will be made and efficiency enhanced in the area in
order to compensate for some 'bad' areas heheh. :)
