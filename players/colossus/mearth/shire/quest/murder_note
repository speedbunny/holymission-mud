* Murder I wrote!*
=----------------=

The once peaceful town of the Shire is now full of crooks and smugglers
due to its opening to the general public. I, as the creator or the town,
am responsible for the increased number of criminal activities within the
vicinity. I want YOU to help! If you are interested simply mention the
word "murder" to the Thain, if you are able to locate him that is. The
Thain has become a very paranoid hobbit and will react whenever the
word "murder" is mentioned in his presence. Follow what the captain says
and use your brain. Since I am so nice and generous, I will even give you
a hint on the secret technique of interrogation! The proper way of
interrogating a witness is by mentioning key words to him. For example,
if you wish to ask about murderer, you should say something like what
do you know about tommy, etc. The same applies for the other two
categories. You can also ask a witness his name or job if you think
that will help. At any time when you think you have the suspected
pin-pointed just go and report it to the Thain.
Since he's not that bright you must state it in the following form:

Murder was committed by <name> with <weapon> at <place>

After every assumption the Thain will send you to find evidence where you
should be able to find if you are right. Return here after that and he will
brief you on your next course of action.
