Here's the things you need to know about the quest.
This is a whodunit quest where you search for evidence
and find the murderer.
The quest begins in hall4.c and all that's needed is to
read the note there and you'll get an idea how to start
the quest. Just type say murder 'murder or anything with
murder in it and the quest begins. The Thain will tell you
who the suspects are, what are the suspected murder weapons
and the murder room. Then there will be 3 witnesses that ma
or may not help you solve the quest. That depends on chr
and wisdom or int (forget the exact combo). You just say or
' the names of the suspects, the murder rooms, and the
murder weapons to them and if your guess is right, the
witness will confirm it. Of course there's always a chance
of the witness lying to you depending on how good/bad your
stats are. 

When you are sure who killed who with what, you go to the
Thain and type 'murder was committed by x with y at z
(this is mentioned in the note in the hall4.c)
If your guess is TOTALLY right, then there is an invis_search
object (also invis_search.c in the same directory) cloned to
you and there will be rooms and weapons set. You have to have
ALL assumptions correct or else there won't be anything set.

Now you've got your invis_search and you go to the right room
and search it, you'll find the murder weapon which you take back
to the Thain in hall4.c and give it to him. He will then give you
an arrest warrant. What you do now is to go to:
/players/colossus/mearth/shire/forest3.c
and you will begin the chase sequence where you pursue the poor
fugitive around (automatic movements with command).
When he gives up all you need to do is go back to hall4.c and the
rest will be taken care of. The prisoner will then be locked in
cell0-3 (random) and you can go visit him hehe. 

Voila, instant quest.
