Gondor will be coded soon and I've made a standard room already
in /players/colossus/private/gcity.c. This will be the standard
inheritable file with which my city will be built. It will be
interesting to see how much of Gondor I can visualize and put
into code. Give me a month and I'll have another quality area
on this mud. Anyone who wants to suggest anything or comment
can do so and constructive criticism will be received. If you
like to join in with me in coding Gondor we will talk.
