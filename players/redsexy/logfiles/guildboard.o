tmp_text "Some of you aren't old enough to remember the Summoner Guild.\nSome of you may well remember the chaos we caused.\nIts time now to cast off old allegiances and pledge your loyalty here.\n\nThe legend of the Summoner is a vast and intricate one.  Before\nyou can join you have to pass a series of tests.  This is so that\nonly the most elite players can join our number.  We are an\nelitist guild.  We never tell our secrets to the outside world,\nand we are not particularly loyal to one another either.  We\ninvest our energies into the creatures we create.\n\nIts deliberatly hard to find our guild.  New players should be\nvetted carefully before being invited to the guild, and in most cases new\nplayers will not be admitted until a formal introduction to the Guild\nMaster is made.  Of course, there will be the occaisonal new player\nwho manages to find their way here all by themselves.  They should\nbe treated with suspicion until you have maintained their worthiness.\n\nSummoner will rule the MUD once more!\n\nRedsexy\n\n**\n\n**\n"
