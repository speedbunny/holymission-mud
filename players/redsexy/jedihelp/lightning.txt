
Lightning is the most powerful force a Jedi
has atthier disposal. It takes some time to
build up the energies for a powerful strike,
and if the Jedi is not careful it will build
beyond control and injure the Jedi. Lighting
strikes can be directed at an individual target
or at a whole room full. For more information
on how to use lightning read the help on
prepare, free, and spread.

Yoda says: Carry a jar of hair gel. If the
           charge gets out of control, you may
           need it to keep your hair from
           standing on end.
