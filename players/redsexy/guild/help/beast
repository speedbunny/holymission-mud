    The Beast of Burden will help you carry heavy items, a great
advantage if you need to carry many extra things. The Beast will
follow you until banished or attacked; it does not fight, but
will explode if attacked, causing damage to its attacker. If
killed the beast will drop everything it is carrying, but if
banished it will take everything with it. Note that you can use
btake, bgive and bdrop with "<number> coins" to transfer money;
also bgive and bdrop can take "all" as an argument.

Commands:
  - summon beast: Summons the Beast to you             (costs 40 sp)
  - btake <item>: Makes the Beast take <item> from you (costs 5  sp)
  - bgive <item>: Makes the Beast give <item> to you   (costs 5  sp)
  - bdrop <item>: Makes the Beast drop <item>          (costs 5  sp)
  - ban beast:    Banishes the Beast                   (costs 10 sp)
