    You can Summon many different creatures, which all serve you in
different ways. The creatures in the first column below are special
creatures, while the rest are Attackers. You may only command 3
Creatures at once, and the "Level Required" is the level at which
there is no chance of a given Attacker turning against you. If you
attempt to summon an Attacker at a level lower than the required
level, there is a chance that it will break free of your control.

Creatures which can be summoned:
  - roc           - wolf            - earth
  - raven         - triton          - fire
  - wisp          - djinn           - power
  - beast         - vilstrak        - lesser
                  - efreet          - greater
                  - water           - lord
                  - wind            - arch
