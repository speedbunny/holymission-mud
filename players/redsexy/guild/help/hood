    All Summoner Cloaks have a magical hood which can be worn
to block out unwanted communication. By specifying a level, you
can shut out all shouts, tells, and other communications from
players at and below that level.

Command:
  - hood <level>: Blocks out <level> and below
  - hood:         Shows you the current hood level
  - hood 0:       Removes your hood if worn
