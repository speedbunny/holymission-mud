    The Will-O-The-Wisp is a living globe of Light which will
float behind you until banished or attacked. The more powerful
you are, the stronger the Wisp's light. The Wisp does not
fight, but if attacked will explode, causing damage to the
player that attacked it.

Commands:
  - summon wisp: Summons the Wisp to you (costs 25 sp)
  - ban wisp:    Banishes the Wisp       (costs 10 sp)
