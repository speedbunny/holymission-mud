Restoration:
    The ancient art of Summoning remained lost for thousands of
years, until even its memory had disappeared. Almost.
    Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, one Summoner survived.
He remembered the War, he remembered his former power, now gone
with the sundering of the Prism. And he had learned from his
mistakes, never to repeat them. Crippled in the War, he should
have died; but he had unlocked the secret of Immortality and
lived. He calls himself Aeternus, and he is now the Guildmaster.
    In his crippled state, he beseeched all he met to search for
the fragments of the shattered Prism. A brave and cunning soul,
Genocyber, restored the Prism and the brought the Guild back
into the world.
