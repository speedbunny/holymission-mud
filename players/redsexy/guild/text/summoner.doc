THE GUILD OF SUMMONERS
--- ----- -- ---------

    As excerpted from the Lore of Summoners:

             "Summoners are a select band of devout magic-users who have
	 mastered the black art of summoning beasts from other Planes of
         existence to do their bidding. They are an extremely dark and
         mysterious group, choosing to keep the source of their talents
         hidden....
             Though somewhat frail in physical body, the Summoner is
         powerful in mind, relying on sharp, cunning wits to survive..."

    Since Summoners rely on spells more than brute force in their
adventuring, their max hp/sp are calculated as follows:

    - HP: (50 + 9  * (CON - 1))
    - SP: (50 + 10 * (INT - 1))

----------

             "...Their Brooches, which are all linked to each other and to
         the Prism, allow them to communicate and to draw Power from the
         Prism itself..."

    The Summoner Brooch is an item which serves several purposes. Members
of the guild communicate through it: they may turn the guild-talk on and
off, list all Summoners playing at any given time, and send free messages
and emotes to their fellows. Additionally, the Brooch stores Power, which
may be purchased at 5 coins per point from the Prism of Elements in the
guild. Once stored, this Power may be converted into hp or sp at any time.
The maximum power that can be stored in the Brooch is:

    - BP: (30 + (10 * LEVEL) + (8 * STR) + (5 * INT))

    Brooch Power is saved, and autoloads.

----------

         "...They have control over raw Elements allowing them to create
         Golems to protect them..."

    Depending on their level, Summoners can create Golems of varying power.
Once created, the Golems serve to protect their masters in combat; every
round, there is a chance that the Golem will force its master's attacker
to attack it instead, and the same chance that the attacker will not
switch back to attacking the Summoner that round. This chance is
calculcated by:

    - DEFEND: ((20 + Golem's AC) + (LEVEL / 3) + (DEX / 5))
    - SWITCH: ((100 - DEFEND) / 2)

    Only one Golem may be commanded at a time. Available types are:

    NAME     REQ LEVEL SP COST AC HP
    ----     --------- ------- -- --
    clay         1       20    1  
    bronze       6       30    2
    iron         11      50    4
    steel        16      80    8
    stone        21      120   16
    diamond      26      200   20

    The cost for banishing a Golem is 25 sp.

----------

         "...and to call forth storms and other Elemental disturbances..."

    With their "call" spells, Summoners combine Elements for various
effects. The spells are:

    NAME     REQ LEVEL SP COST
    ----     --------- -------
    ice          3        10
    cyclone      4        15
    mud          4        50
    smoke        5        30
    blaze        5        40
    magma        5        40
    bolt         22       50

    The spells which do damage, and their damage calculations, are:

    - ICE:     (10 + (STR / 2) + (DEX / 2))
    - CYCLONE: (20 + (STR / 2) + (DEX / 2))
    - BLAZE:   (20 + (STR / 2) + (DEX / 2)) to each attacker
    - MAGMA:   (50 + (STR / 2) + (DEX / 2))
    - BOLT:    (50 + STR + DEX)

    The smoke spell increases the player's ac for a limited time. The
associated calculations are:

    - AC:   (2 + (DEX / 10))
    - TIME: (5 + (DEX / 3))

    Finally, the mud spell holds all attacking monsters for a limited time.
This time is calculated by:

    - TIME: (2 + (STR / 5))

----------

         "...And they...can summon beasts from other dimensions to serve
         them, aiding them in such areas as combat..."

    The Summoner's most powerful ally is his Attacker. There are currently
14 different beasts which can be summoned to fight for their masters:

    NAME        REQ LEVEL SP COST HP RANGE  AC WC SPELL BAN SP
    ----        --------- ------- --------- -- -- ----- ------
    Wolf            1        10   90-110    5  6  None    10
    Triton          7        20   125-175   7  8  None    20
    Djinn           8        30   175-225   8  9  None    20
    Vilstrak        9        40   225-275   9  10 None    20
    Efreet          10       50   275-325   10 11 None    20
    Water Element   12       70   500-600   12 13 0-20    30
    Wind Element    13       80   600-700   13 14 0-25    30
    Earth Element   14       90   700-800   14 15 0-30    30
    Fire Element    15       100  800-900   15 16 0-35    30
    Power Element   23       150  1000-1200 23 24 0-45    35
    Lesser Demon    26       200  1300-1500 26 27 0-50    40
    Greater Demon   27       250  1500-1700 27 28 0-50    40
    Demon Lord      28       300  1700-1900 28 29 0-50    40
    Arch-Demon      29       400  1900-2100 29 30 0-60    50

    The Greater Demon and Demon Lord have 5%-per-round chance of doing a
tentacle attack which hits all monsters attacking them for 30 damage points.
Likewise, the Arch-Demon has a 5% chance of doing a fire attack which does
50 damage points.
    During combat, the Attacker's master may command it to attack another
monster (10 sp), stop fighting (20 sp), or, in the case of the Demon Lord
and Arch-Demon, make their foes run away in fear (50 sp). If a Summoner
tries to call forth an Attacker when his level is not high enough, there
is still a chance he will succeed. If not, the creature will attack him.
This chance of success is found thusly:

    - SUCCESS: (25 + CHA + WIS - Attacker's LEVEL)

----------

         "...communication, light, and information..."

    Other creatures may also be summoned to perform various tasks. These are:

      NAME            SP COST BAN SP
      ----            ------- ------
      Roc                25     10
      Raven              10     10
      Will-O-The-Wisp    25     10
      Beast of Burden    40     10
      Seeker             50     10

    The Roc simply carries the player back to his Guild. The Raven, once
summoned, can talk to other players for 2 sp per message, and "peck" players
(no damage) for 5 sp. The Will-O-The-Wisp is simply a light source; if
killed, it does 50 sp of damage to its killer.  Its light-strength is
caluculated by:

    - LS: (1 + (LEVEL / 6))

    The Beast of Burden can carry things for its master. Giving an item or
coins to the Beast, taking things from it, and making it drop things each
costs 5 sp. The Beast has a carrying capacity exactly equal to that of the
player at the time of summoning. When killed the Beast does 80 sp of
damage to its killer.
    The Seeker is a familiar. To make it look at something, to name it,
or to make it say or emote something to its room costs 5 sp. To make it
move in a given direction or enter something costs 10 sp. To make it
return to its master costs 15 sp, and to make it follow someone or to
toggle the "snoop" costs 20 sp. When killed the Seeker does 100 hp of
damage to its killer.

----------

             "...Because of their secretive nature...further details about
         their powers remain known only to them..."

    There are also other commands available to Summoners. One allows them
to check weapons and armour in order to make sure that these will not 
interfere with their spells; they may only use equipment that is made
especially for them, or armour that has ac == 0.
    Another command allows them to block out communication from others.
Like the wiz command "busy", the highest level that may be blocked out is
the player's level.
    Finally, there is a command that shows the Summoner all vital
information about his status. Power stored in the Brooch, guild-line
status, busy-level, and summoned or created Creatures are all listed by
this command.
