Rise:
    There was a time, in ancient years, when Summoners were the
most powerful beings to walk the earth. They had mastery of all
dimensions and could summon even the most powerful dark beings
to serve them, and they could call forth raw Elements to
unleash world-scale catastrophes; for they had at their command
all the Lore of their elders, and no one was powerful enough to
stop them.
    They drew their strength from a Prism made of solid diamond,
which held within its many-faceted surface all Elements: Water,
Wind, Earth, and Fire, bound together by Power. They fashioned
intricate Brooches to contain a tiny fraction of the Prism's
contents, and it was through these that they communicated with
each other and with the Prism itself.
