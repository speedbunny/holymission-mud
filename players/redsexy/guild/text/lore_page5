Powers:
    Though not nearly as powerful as they were in ancient days,
the Summoners have rediscovered much of their ancestors' lore
and have re-attained many of their former abilities.
    Their Brooches, which are all linked to each other and to
the Prism, allow them to communicate and to draw Power from the
Prism itself. They have control over raw Elements, allowing
them to create Golems to protect them and to call forth storms
and other Elemental disturbances. And they of course can summon
beasts from other dimensions to serve them, aiding them in such
areas as combat, communication, light, and information.
    Because of their secretive nature, however, further details
about their powers remain known only to them.
