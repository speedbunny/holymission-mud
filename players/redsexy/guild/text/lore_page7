Rules:
    The Guild of Summoners is an elite guild, and its Elders
strictly enforce a few basic rules. In order to maintain the
utmost secrecy, Aeternus has forbidden Summoners to reveal the
location of their sacred chambers, and in doing so keeps out
the unworthy. Those who truly seek the Guild will discover it
on their own.
    It has also been decreed that no information about the
strengths, weaknesses, Trials, or powers of the guild may be
told to any outsiders. They will, if they are worthy, discover
these by their own efforts and experience.
    The guild and its powers, by their very nature, must be
kept hidden from the outside world. Failure to abide by the
Law set down by the Elders must result in severe punishment.
