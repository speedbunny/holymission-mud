General:
    Summoners are a select band of devout magic-users who have
mastered the black art of summoning beasts from other Planes of
existence to do their bidding. They are an extremely dark and
mysterious group, choosing to keep the source of their talents
hidden; for these talents are powerful indeed, and if misused
could unleash terrible and uncontrollable forces on the world.
    Though somewhat frail in physical body, the Summoner is
powerful in mind, relying on sharp, cunning wits to survive. He
needs Intelligence to learn the complicated methods of casting
his spells, Wisdom to realize what he can control, and Charisma
to bend his creatures to his will.
