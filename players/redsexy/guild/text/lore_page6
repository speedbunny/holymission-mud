Learning:
    The learning of a novice Summoner progresses in set stages,
which are denoted by his Guild titles. He begins his training
as a novitiate, and then proceeds, as his level increases, to
learn techniques for calling forth and combining the Elements.
Next he learns how to summon relatively weak creatures from
each of the planes of Water, Wind, Earth, and Fire, always in
that order.
    After this he may summon the Elements themselves in living
form; and finally, he learns to summon and control the most
powerful of creatures, Demons, from the Underworld. Thereafter
his training is complete; he is a full-fledged Summoner.
