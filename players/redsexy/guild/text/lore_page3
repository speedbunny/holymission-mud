Fall:
    After a time, the band of Summoners became greedy; the more
Dimensional secrets they unlocked, the more their hunger for
knowledge and power grew. They began to bicker among themselves
over territory, over the ancient Books, and over shares of the
Prism's power. This bickering quickly escalated, and thus began
the most destructive war in history, the War of Elements.
    In the earth-shattering battles that followed, countless
lives, both human and otherworldly, were lost. The Summoners
destroyed themselves and their lore was lost to the world, the
precious Prism sundered.
