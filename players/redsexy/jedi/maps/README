These maps are suitable for use with ZMud 5.13 and above.

To use the maps, first download HolyMiss.zfg and HolyMiss.zzz
and store them in the ZMud/HolyMiss directory.

Then download the .map files and store them in the directory
Zmud/HolyMiss/Maps

You are now ready to start exploring!

Start ZMud, and chose Window/Automapper from the menu.
The Automapper window will be displayed.

From the Automapper window, choose File/Open Master Map.
Then open the HolyMiss.zzz map.

You will be displayed with a list of zones, these are the
areas contained in /players/redsexy/areas.

Choose the zone which matches the directory name you wish to
explore, then rightclick on any of the boxes displayed in the
Automapper window and choose Start Position.

If you hold the mouse pointer over that little box long
enough it will tell you which filename it corresponds to.

On the MUD, type "goto <filename>", then use the map to
help you explore!

Just by double clicking on any room in the map, the
automapper will take you there!

Have Fun

ADVICE!

Please use the Automapper in "Follow" mode, if you use it in "Edit"
mode it may overwrite my maps :)

If you already have a Holy Mission map, be sure to rename it before
downloading these!

KNOWN PROBLEMS

Five rooms in the island area have been mapped manually, due to 
certain problems with the ZMud Mapping Configuration settings.
These will not cause any problems in Follow mode, but will
cause immense difficulty in Edit :)  You have been warned :)
