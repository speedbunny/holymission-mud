virtually untouched here, the sea fierce and meanacing.  Everything looks the
same as far as the eye can see.  You don't think you are lost but at the same
time, you are not sure you can find the way home...                                          18   You feel tired as you continue along the coast of this strange desert island.

again, or if you will die in this trecherous place.  There is no way to
venture inland - the heat prevents you from leaving the shore, where there is
at least a breeze blowing from the sea                                          21   You rest a while to gaze out at the sea, admire its power and beauty.  The
sand is too hot to lie on though and it is too uncomfortable to rest anywhere
for long, with the evil treacherous suns beating down your neck.                                          22   The atmosphere is unbaerable.  The humidity of the sun and the endlessness of

like venturing further. Who knows what adventures may lie ahead?                                          23   You stand on the western tip of the island, gazing out over the sea.  You have
almost forgotten what vegetation looks like, and strain to see what lies
beyond the horizon, but can make out nothing but the putrid waters and the
sand around you.                                          24   The inlet finishes here, and you can see the sea in its full glory again.  A

line.                                           25   You are walking by an inlet on the island.  Somehow the waves are controlled
here, allowing anyone who wished to enter the water to do so, but the slime
and undergrowth seem so unsavoury its doubtful anyone would dare.                                          2   Walking across the shoreline now, the sea seems calmer and more relaxing.  The
sand here is coarser than any other you have seen and it cuts like splinters
of glass when it touches your skin.  This is no ordinary island though, it is
more like a desert and two evil suns beat down on you.  Luckily the wind blows
in from the sea, keeping you cool and alert.  You feel as if you will need
your wits about you should you venture any further                                          1   The view here is spectacular.  Waves lash against the jetty, the spray wetting
your lips slightly as the wind blows to the shore, making you struggle to keep
your balance. The vastness of the Dune Sea spread out in front of you makes
you feel small and insignificant.  You realise that even greater adventurers
have lost their lives in this sea. Perhaps it is time to leave before the
waves drag you under.                                          5   You have arrived at a quiet commuter port on a sandy desert island. A few
