the rest of the bar, this seems to be the  area where lovers enjoy each
other's company, and couples sit here whispering sweet nothings to each other.                                        J You have entered a dark bar, crowded with many creatures of various races.   You realise this must be the Mos Eisley Cantina, and it is more vibrant than
you ever imagined it to be!  Music drifts over the loud chattering and
laughter in here and everyone seems to be having a really good time.  You
forget the desert outside and begin to relax.                                           8   At last you have found the place to get served around here!  The selection of
cocktails and beverages from around the realms is immense, never before have
you had such a choice - but then again, Wuntar is renouned for his drinks
being the best.                                           7   The creatures here are all impatiently bustling around, either to the bar to
get another drink, or from the bar, taking the drinks back to where they are
sitting.  The chattering here is loud, as old friends and aquaintances  bump
into one another and exchange pleasantries.                                           13 X This part of the bar is jam packed with creatures, all dancing and tapping
their feet to the music that fills the room.  The band are on top form tonight
and even you take a moment to listen to them.  The stage is to the southwest, 
and you begin to wonder if you can fight through the crowds to take an even
closer look at who is playing.                                          17 u You are now right in front of the stage of the Mos Eisley cantina, watching
the band perform and feeling extremely mellow.  It seems to be The Dan Lo-ging
Jizwailers, and you watch the show in awe, wishing you were as musical as
these geniuses.   The crowd around you clap enthusiastically at the end of
every number, and you feel like you could watch the show forever.                                          14 r The floor here is wooden and polished, and you realise this area is set aside
for those who want to dance to the wonderful music that the band are playing. 
although you cannot see the stage from here, the music can be heard clearly,
and a little ball made of pieces of reflective glass spins around suspended
from the roof, providing a spectacular lighting effect.                                           18   these are the dressing rooms of the Mos Eisley Cantina, where visiting artists
come and change into their show gear, and sit and enjoy refreshments after a 
gruelling days entertainment.  There is a rack here with clothes hangers and a
large oak cupboard, stretching to the ceiling.                                           12   The area here is laid out with tables and chairs where people can sit around
and enjoy an informal drink with one another.  Creaures sit around and chat
about life, the universe and everything, whilst the music of the band drifts
around you.                                          11 6 There seem to be a lot of seedy characters in this area of the bar, and they
eye you with suspicion as you walk over.  You imagine they are discussing
illegal smuggling deals and trade offs. It is much darker here, the area only
lit with candles, and you feel like you have entered some kind of underworld.          	                               16   This room is obviously an office of some kind, and there is a wooden desk with
a chair pushed under the table here.  Unlike the rest of the Cantina  this
room is carpeted, and by looking at the plaque on the open door, you realise          
                               4   You have entered one of the booths in the Mos Eisley cantina, typically set
out for a crowd of friends to sit together in secluded from the rest of the
mayhem in the place.  It is much quieter in here, and you feel as if you don't
have a care in the world.                                          5 X This area of the cantina seems to be  set aside for illegal gambling and
games. There is a re-uska table set up in the corner and you'd quite fancy a
game if you could ever figure out how to play! This room is full of smoke,
from the pipes and cigars of the rich creatures who play here, so you don't
feel like hanging around for too long.                                          10 W This area of the cantina seems to be  set aside for illegal gambling and

You guess that the operation is illegal, but note that you can change your
gold coins for credits here, the widely accepted form of currency for gambling
in Mos Eisley.                                           20   This is obviously the store room of the Mos Eisley cantina and you can see
many barrels and strange concoctions in flasks and jars adorning the floors
and the shelves.  You are tempted to steal some, but then realise that Wunter
is such a nice and trusting man, you would never dare, so you leave well
alone.  What is one creatures amber nectar, you remember, is anothers poision!                                          19 J This token booth is hidden in a dark corner of the Cantina, and a sly looking
