What is the Force?

The force is created by all living things.  A sensitive jedi feels the emotions
and thoughts of the collective, and channels them to his or her own uses.

Full control of the force only comes through practice.  Even great jedi masters
can find it difficult to control all the powers they have and combine them to
the greatest effect.  As a jedi progresses through the learning stages they 
will learn new ways to apply the force.

In the words of the great Ben Kenobi - May the Force be With You.
