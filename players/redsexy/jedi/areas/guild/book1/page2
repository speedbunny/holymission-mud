Some excerpts from the logs of Luke Skywalker, trainee jedi.

"Corsucant.

Ben told me to use the force.  Damn him, I don't even know what the force is,
let alone how to use it."

"Dagobah.

A scrawny green guy by the name of Yoda expected me to eat his food and balance
on one hand.  I told him I wanted to be a jedi and not a clown and he just 
laughed at me and told me to use the force.....

He put me in a cave today to face my fears and I hallucinated I was fighting
my old enemy Darth and then Darth turned into me.  Must be the soup Yoda gave
me yesterday cos I also imagined I saw Ben.  But what is this force thing
anyway?"
