The Sides of the Force.

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, the fight between the good and
evil sides of the force caused a rift which resulted in the loss of many
lives from many races.  Now, the dark and the light jedi live as one,
united in a common cause on a common ground.  Old conflicts forgotten, 
new enemies have arisen.  The personality traits of the Dark and
Light, however, are still in conflict.

Those of The Light Side are caring and generous.  They fight for what they
believe in, without malice.  Their powers lie in self preservation, defending
themselves from the cruelties of those more powerful.

Those of the Dark Side are the takers.  They kill anything that stands in their
way, not understanding the true worth of the life that surrounds them.  Their
powers lie in the strength of their attacks, and the ability to instill fear 
into their opponents.
