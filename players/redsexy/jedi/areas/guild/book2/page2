"About this book"

First up the title of this book is a bit misleading cos no matter how
much you want to kill your friends, you're not really supposed to.
No matter how muh they piss you off.  But, you will find you encounter
a number of creatures as you venture around the lands and their sole 
purpose in life is to die for your gain.  So, here are the important
things to bear in mind.

1) Love killing
2) Go killing
3) Reap the benefits of killing

Repeat the above as often as necessary till you become immortal or till
your eyes fall out, your hair goes gray and your breath stinks.

Otherwise people are going to think you are really lame.
