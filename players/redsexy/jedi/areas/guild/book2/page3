"But this book is meant to tell me HOW to kill things!" I hear you cry.

Enough already.

You get weapons. Go searching for them, someone may have left something
lying around.  If not, go to a shop and buy something.  Of course the
lucky Jedi guild get a free weapon anyhow.

Then get some armour.  Follow the above principles.

Make sure you're wearing and wielding all the stuff you have and the next
time you encounter a creature kill it.  Ok scrap that advice unless yer
really tough.  The best thing to do is to try and figure out how tough a
creature is by looking at the surroundings, then establish if you are 
good enough to kill it.

Each kill gets you experience and each time you get experience you become
tougher.  Its all progressive you see.
