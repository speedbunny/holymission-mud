In the far southeast there lies an inn,
Where creatures while their hours away,
The drinks flow fast for the right kind of cash,
Its there that I shall stay.

Down deep the south the town does thrive,
With traders of all creeds,
Whatever the weather they'll toil and tether, 
To meet all of your needs.

A port in the north where the wind is caught,
Will take you to Carkoon,
By day or by night you can get there alright,
Whilst the sailor sings his tune.

And here, the palace you have found,
Is Jabba's favourite reside,
Beware the guards, beware them big,
Cos there is nowhere you can hide....

Muftak luvs Kabe forever.
