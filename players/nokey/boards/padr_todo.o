tmp_text "the map of the maze needs updating.\n\n\n**\nthe bodyguards must follow again, also they should be (able to become)\nsomewhat more tough, they are near to useless now. they could also be\nmade smarter than they are.\n\n\n**\nThere is some kind of error in the secret instructions of the secret police\ncaptain. It would also be nice if he gave loer level players at least a \nchance to solve the quest. The chaosblade must only be accepted from the one\nwho actually killed the chaosdemon.\n\n\n**\nThe livings on the walking castle's bridge must not be able to run away.\nI'll make the impression to players that there's a spell on the room that\nnullifies all fearing spells. I suggest on implementing this via a shadow\non run_away() that is cloned and set to shadow this_player() in the init()\nof the room. The exit() will remove the shadow, and the shadow will be coded\nthat it autodestructs if the run_away is called and the evironment of\nthe shadowed player is not the walking castle bridge.\nIf there are no objections, i'd make the text of it something like:\nPadrone has, with the help of the wise jedi Nokey, who understands the\nnature of fear, put a spell on this room that eliminates all feelings\nof fear, You cannot fear anyone out of this room.\n\n\n**\nIs the weather used at all? If you wanna see weather, i'll show you some\nreal good looking weather. Like what i build on callandor.\n\n\n**\nThe dungeon that is cloned at the bottom of padrone's static castle has to\nbe made so that it won't clone an additional monster at a reset when there\nare already a certain number of them. I say no more than 10\n\n\n**\nInstead of having the chaosdemon carry the chaosblade, it can carry a note\nsaying where it's hidden. This can be at a number of random places.\n\n\n**\nSpread the 'wanted' posters around some more (i.e.: room/church)\nCreate some more monsters that will make you a desperado\n\n\n**\nThe surgeon in Padrones is not perfect, after trans-x operation the FINGER command still shows the original sexe.\nI think it was different a while ago, but then again I'm only a shabby little Salesman.\n\n\n**\nThe hat does not have to be worn to be invis!\n\n\n**\nthe stone with the strange weight is bugged.\n\n\n**\nIt is true that the finger command still shows the sex before the operation.\nThis is due to the fact that the player does not get saved right\nafter it. I fixed it, tho the file's not been strict_typed yet.\nJust added some   client->save_me(1);  after the lines set_male() or\nset_female() etc.\n\n\n**\nI'd like to make all people in the conference room snoop-proof\nas well, but i'm not sure how to solve that. Snooping by a NPC does not seem\nto be the answer to it. Also the help on snoop is a bit sketchy.\n\n\n**\ni just thought you needed a more updated note here\nso here it is\n=P\n--------------->ME\n\n**\nHere's another... scrub Padrone!\n\n**\n\n**\n"
