Druids are a reclusive lot by nature.  They tend to keep to 
themselves for the most part as they do not need to associate
with followers of other paths.  Druids are the most dynamic
guild in that they have a unique variety of healing and
combat spells known only to them.

See "dhelp spells" for a list of available spells.
