tmp_text "This is my first note here.\nHave a fun.\n\n\n**\nthe Fencing school (gates,e,e,e,e,n,e,s) is great (too) :)\n\n\n**\nIt would be good to put some hard monsters here and a quest would be good too :) are these orcs AI??? they seem to learn :)) still they are weak :)\n\n\n**\n\nhow bout some hints as to how to get by the SPHINX???\n\n\n\n**\nFirst time I got here. Just wanted to leave something lasting :)\nIt's a nice area ! Not too crowded for not many people know how to find it.\nStill have to figure out the steel key for the fencing school, but I'll probably find it.\n\nHave to go. I died yest. and I need 1,000,000 XP !\n\nGullit\n\n\n**\ni cannot give you more hints. read hints in quest_list,\nThats all i can said about it.\nG\n\n\n**\nIt's a nice area, and a nice quest (i'm solving it without hints)\n\n\n**\nHello,\nI would like to fix all typos and bugs (if any) in the Nottingham.\nIt will help me very much if you use read carrefuly descriptions and\nuse TYPO, BUG, IDEA to send a message to me.\nIf you find a bug, write path [filename] of object with all\nline-numbers where the bug is.\n\nThank you,\n                       Sir Goldsun.\n\n\n**\nHi, I would like to ask You one question:\n \"Do you want orcs in Nottingham every reset or every reboot ?\nYour answer put on this board or mail me it.\nThank you.\n\n\n**\nI want here orcs: every reset, every reboot and every minute...\nBut please make this place not possible for orcs. They come here\nand I cannot fight here. How could I kill them, huhh?\n\nMore ORCs wanted....\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAwer the Detrimentor\n\nPS: About note-editor. I cannot abort message. My typewriter doesn't\nhave the '/\\/' character ;->   Can you change the abort-code?\n\n\n**\nHiya \nAbout the orcs..the idea is very cool. \nIt does add some excitement to this city, but it's a pain when\nyou cannot leave because the city is under attack.\nYesterday, more and more kept coming and I was here forever.\nI would still say keep them at each reset though.\n\n\t\t\t\tMork\n\n\n**\nWhy can't I kill orcs in this room?\nWhy do the orcs come here   (do they read NOTTINGHAM BOARD) ?\nOr do the orcs deposit their money (or their knives maybe) in bank?\n\nOh, now I know!\n   Those 2% in NOTTINGHAM BANK are dedicated to orcs. That's why so many\norcs come here. This is their wage for being killed.\n\nPS:   I *CAN* kill orcs in this room. It's very simple...\n\n\n**\nHI, i love this bank\nonly 2 %\n\n\n**\nare you supposed to get outta here if you happen to stumble upon it....\nthis place sucks...\n:(\n\n**\nI have tried many times to fight to death with master, but when i bow \nto students nothing happens -- i have tried every wording i can think \nof.  I am not allowed to fight normally in the room, and hassan and the\nmaster are too high level to scare out with bone wand.  Am I missing some-\nthing obvious or is this a bug?\n\n                            Dillon\n\nPS cool area, but why is Gisberns shield so damned small?!? :)\n\n**\nhow come when i kill all the orcs the town is still under attack\nam i missing something really simple?\n\n\nvash\npuzzled again\n\n**\nJust want to ask same question as in 16, because its realy depressing:\nall orcs are death, but the town is still under attack !!!\n\nWhats wrong ???\nBye Twist !!!\n\n**\nI have 2 queries..\n1st, I ca't figure out how to get into the open tower doors.\nI've tried all the syntax I can think of, but to no avail..\n2nd, is there any way of getting rid of these damn guards, apart from leaving the city??!!\nPause..:)\n\n**\nI noticed that even tho the doors were open, i couldn't get in.  Eventually I \nfigured it out.  There is a way in!\nme\n\n**\nOk..Town is in panic, but no orcs??\nErm..I can't get into tower doors either...\nHelp?\nMisty.\n\n**\nHI,\nto enter tower doors type 'tower'.\nit is caused by stupid short_door syntax\nG.\n\n**\nHI,\nI have a presentiment why is the town in the panic & all orcs are dead.\nAll code is frozen. I hope new Nottingham will cool too and without bugs \nofcourse. \nIf there is deadly bug, report me please. I fix it as soon as possible.\n\n**\nI love this place\nbeautifull setting, marvellous surroundings, but...\nwhere are the orcs??\n\nI can't find them, although i did find some guards.\n\nI'll keep searching, and keep up the good work.\n\n**\nTo fix the bugs i remove orcs from the town.\nNew town will be without orcs, but with Nottingham Feast.\n::\n\n**\nI deposited 24414 coins here yesterday and now they are gone.\nAt only a 2% per day loss I should have over 23000 dollars here,\nbuyt I do not.  Could someone explain this to me?  \nI needed that cash.       Vagabond Hemis**\n\n**\n"
