This system helps to use many boats, dragons ... .
It uses only necessery call_outs (for necessery time), it means
if nobody presents in harbours && nobody presents in aboard then 
boat is transfered to [central_harb.c] and waits here like a dead object
 (all call_outs are stopped). For more info see 
                   [players/goldsun/gen/obj/boat.c] (object for inheritance)

This system is good protected. Any object of it can be destructed. Will no bug.


How to code own boat lines / dragon lines / ... ?

This is example of boat_network :  

We need those objects:   1) room where boat lands         [harbour]
	 		 2) object which is traveling     [boat]
                         3) room - aboard for travelers   [aboard]
	                 4) object who makes illusion of
				 travel (not necessery)   [talker]
This system uses own master.
It is "central_harb.c".
      (Try to look "players/goldsun/gen/room/central_harb.c")
Ask Goldsun or Arches to add your [boat]
to the variable boat_list, else your boat will not work.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    [harbour]        See : "players/goldsun/example/my_harbour.c"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
    In a single room code this:
 
     #include "/players/goldsun/gen/harb.h 
     #define CENTRAL_HARBOUR "/players/goldsun/gen/room/central_harb"
       (this is a function)
     string *boat_land;

  (    ....etc

   THE BEST WAY IS TO COPY whole my_harbour.c and CHANGE the
      descriptions and code

      boat_land=({"<name of your boat>",
		  "<name of friend boat>" 
	         });

      As you can see we can add many boats or dragons that lands here.

      [boat]         See : "players/goldsun/example/my_boat.c"

   All you need to code is:

   inherit "/players/goldsun/gen/obj/boat"
    reset(arg){
     ::reset(arg);
    if (arg) return;
     set_name("cargo junk");
     set_alias("junk");
     voyage=({"<file1>",time,
	      "<file2>,time2
             });

       (
!!!      WARNING            !!!
!!!     file1 like  "/players/goldsun/room/test" is wrong.
!!!     code     :  "players/goldsun/room/test"
!!!     This is necessery, i am using member_array and file_name.
!!!      file_name() returns name of file without first "/"


        This is voyage list. File1 and file2 are files of harbours and
	time is time_length [sec] of way between file1 and file2 and
        time2 is time_length [sec] between file2 to file1.
        cargo junk stats in file1 and continues to file2 , from file2
	to file1.
       
!!    If you want to code airlines with dragons, you have to
!!    code set_alt_name("dragons");
!!    standart is set_alt_name("boat");
  
        )
         destination("<file name of aboard>"); /* here we move traveler */
                                              /* by action enter boat   */

         sailor_name="hook";   /* name of captain, is using in msgs */
         anchor_time=35;       /* anchoring time in every harbour */
         arr_time=20;          /* time to arrive from central harbour */

         msgin=capitalize(name)+" arrives.\n";
         msgout=capitalize(name)+" is sailing away.\n";
         sailor_msgout=capitalize(sailor_name)+" says: We are sailing on.\n";
         sailor_msgin=capitalize(sailor_name)+" says: We are landing.\n";
!!
!!       transfer(this_object(),CENTRAL_HARBOUR); /* to start this boat */
       }

     [aboard]        See : "players/goldsun/example/my_aboard.c"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
   Note: You can make more than one room, but than overwrite
		functions : 
                       int  query_traveler()
		       void sailor_s(string s)  in your [boat]

     query_traveler()	 returns number of travelers on the boat
			 so you have to check all rooms

     sailor_s(s)    this functions tell_room(x,s), where x is an aboard
		    so you have to code more tell_rooms

That's all.
	Have a fun.
