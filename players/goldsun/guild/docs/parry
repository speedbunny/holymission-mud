PARRY:

   The parry is the skill, to block a victims attack with the weapon.
   It is depending on your parry skill, your strength and your dexterity.
   With any hit roll you have a little change to parry the victims
   hit, depending on your speed (dex) and if your skillroll is sucessful.
   If you have a low strength there is a good change that the victim
   strikes through your parrydefence. The more victims you have, the 
   lower is the chance to parry a hit.


WHAT INFLUENCES YOUR PARRY ?

   1.) The hold: When you are held you can't parry

   2.) The haste/berzerk: Haste or berzerk raises your combat speed,
                          what of course raises your change to parry. 

   3.) Getting many hits:  When you are hit double or more in a round,
                           you cant parry that often. 

PS: Parry is useful on high level, with many attacks against slow attacking
    monsters.
