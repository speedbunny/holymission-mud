This gives you the ability to leave a trail of where you have been
It consists of two commands. One of which places tracks and one which looks
for them.
To leave a track on the ground you use
mark <exit> and this will mark a track pointing towards a particular exit
(It must be an obvious exit)
When you have marked the exit you will also leave in that direction.
The second will show any tracks that are in the same room as you are.
To do this use `uncover tracks` or `uncover marks`.
You will be able to see that tracks made by you or by other fighters but
members of other guilds will not be able to uncover them.

This abilitly is VERY usufull for mazes.
The tracks will vanish after a while.

eg.
mark east
mark e (These will both achieve the same result)

uncover tracks (To find any tracks you left in the present room)
