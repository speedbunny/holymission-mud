the killer wasp is a good idea but maybe i would make it a bit weaker *
shwood39 good idea to make a holy place no fight *
obj/foliage ? search find scroll read scroll You get the snake key hmm got no key *
shwood3 better use only clone list when you directly code the objects in the room :) *
/room/raod maybe did bottom or road .. should work too *
shwood16 hmm same better take if !present(name,this_object()) instead of clone_list *
hmm to your weapons:for clubs .. its better you dont use magic hits :) *
the /obj/well drink well drink water from well would be nice :) *
shwood4 hmm would be nice when the linelength suits to the other rooms *
shwood4 same with clone list :) *
bonus: The rooms are well descriped and have good item descriptions *
bonus: there are much add actions in the rooms :) *
bonus: the area map suits and the monsters are balanced *
bonus: I think this area is better than many most areas nowadays *
malus: The road is only one room not much *
after all: The area is good, neat coded and worth to get improoved soon *
