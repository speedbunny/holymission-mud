Barbarians, naturally, can't wear chainmail or other metal armours, and tend
to be more at home wielding a club or an axe than a a sword. Experienced
barbarians tend to be faster in combat than normal warriors, and can often
manage to get in two or three blows where a normal warrior would only manage
one.

In addition to the standard stats, Barbarians have four additional skills,
combat, melee, fortitude and speed. It's up to you to find out what they do.
