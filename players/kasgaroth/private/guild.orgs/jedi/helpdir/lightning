This spell is something totally new.
First you got to prepare the spell with 'prepare lightning'.
Then the damage of the spell rises after a certain time.
To cast the spell you got to 'free lightning' or 'free lightning at <monster>.
But you can't raise the damage over a certain points. If you try you will 
hurt yourself.

P.S.: If you 'free' a 'lightning' without preparing will cause no damage.
      Maybe a demonstration of Force to another player.
