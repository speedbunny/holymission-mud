---Playercastles (Towers, Caves, Houses, .....)--- 

will be in directory /players/gorlin/castles/* , where   
the * means the name of the player whom the place
belongs to.

players have to be legends to have special places of      
their own.

Pricelist:

        estate          100.000 gold
        1st room         40.000 gold
        2nd room         60.000 gold
        3rd room         80.000 gold
        4th room        120.000 gold
        5th room        180.000 gold
        6th room        300.000 gold
        7th room        500.000 gold

specials will cost extra
        (monsters (guards), drawbridges, doors, 
        interior decoration....)

anyone will be able to enter those places, which will be       
placed at locations throughout all of the mud (so they won't
be just another 'house')

it is a time-consuming project (not that much time needed at
one time, but perpetual work for the next few years, as hm
grows)... when players who have places leave the game, their
locations will either be removed or left as ruins.
