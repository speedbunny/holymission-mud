this project is about to give certain players (legendlevel players)
places of their own (in some parts similar to the 'houses') at some
place in the mud... in fact a small area for each of those players

i want to code this to make this mud more alive
(after all, think logically: player's title are Emperor, High Mage, 
 .... but where are their respective castles, towers, etc.... ?)

what i will do: set up rooms, with special actions, small monsters,
etc. that will not give any special advantage to any player.
there will NOT be items in the rooms (recode each reboot...   
would mean some sort of additional money or eq for players) or
stores or anything like that
these places are only meant to be fun, not to confer any advantage to    
the player who owns them 

perhaps we could set the players staring location to his castle, but
that's about the only advantage i would give to him/her

i think these mini-areas would enrichen the whole mud through 
giving players a real home -> more atmosphere, a bit more 
role-playing (perhaps), but most imortant: fun.

please also read the info file in this directory for more 
information
