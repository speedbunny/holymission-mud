		          	-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
	They are swirling robes, with lightning flashes bolting from their 
	fingertips, elements clashing in a fury, they are the mage.

	Spells and natural skill keep the mages on their toes, always
	ready for adventure.  They are the masters of the elements,
	bending nature to their will.  Others foolishly them pegged as
	easy marks, only to pay the price in the end.  Mages are the
	magic envolkers and they can be an overwhelming force.

	Mage-Master Yorel and Mage-Master Cherlindrea serve as a mentor 
        to all mages, aiding them in knowledge of mastery.  They are 
        the heart and soul of guild, gaining respect from all those 
        they encounters.
