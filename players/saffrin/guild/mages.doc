Note 1:
   All spells are coded in separate files. Fixed figures (like damages and
   durations) are mostly given in tune.h. Mage.h mostly directs basic check 
   functions (like if player is ghost, etc). Magemaster.c calls all the
   spells and lists all required levels and sp-costs. The soul.c is at
   the same time the mage's robe, and covers add_actions, time_guild_soul
   for attack spells, most of the illusion spell and handles sp-cost.

Note 2:
   All mages are able to cast all spells. However, each spell has a 
   certain chance to fizzle (fail), depending of wis, lvl and spell-level. 
   If (wis == lvl == spell-level) there's an 80% chance the spell works. 
   If (wis == lvl) and wis > 1.2 * spell-level the spell never fails.

Here follow the abilities of the one 'real' ability and all spells:

BLAST
   spell-level:   20
   sp cost:       50 points
   effect:        Blast is an attack spell that hits all livings that are
                  not grouped with the caster. Damage is resisted with
                  wis. Blast gives experience equal to the damage done.
   formula:       damage = 30 + random(40) points.

COLORSPRAY
   spell-level:   1
   sp cost:       wis/2 + 1 points
   effect:        Colorspray is an attack spell that hits one opponent
                  with a blinding ray of colours. There's a 50% chance
                  that the target is held for 1 second and possibly misses
                  its next attack. Damage is resisted with wis. Colorspray
                  gives experience equal to the damage done.
   formula:       damage = random(wis) + random(int) + 2 points.

CRUSH
   spell-level:   20
   sp cost:       50 points
   effect:        Crush is an attack spell that summons a virtual fist 
                  that crushes one opponent. Damage is resisted with wis.
                  Crush gives experience equal to the damage done.
   formula:       damage = 50 + random(50) points.

DETECT
   spell-level:   13
   sp cost:       30 points
   effect:        Detect shows all visible objects and all invisible 
                  livings present in the room.

EYE
   spell-level:   6
   sp cost:       20 points
   effect:        Eye shows the long_description of the next room in one
                  of the directions given in the obvious exits (must be
                  given in a dest_dir array) and all visible objects in it.

FEAR
   spell-level:   3
   sp cost:       30 points
   effect:        Fear scares a living so much that it runs away. If that
                  is not possible, it starts a fight.
   formula:       if lvl < lvl_of_target chance of success is
                  1 : level_difference.

FEEBLE
   spell-level:   3
   sp cost:       30 points
   effect:        Feeble dulls the mind of an opponent and causes it to 
                  attack someone else. If it fails, there's a 75% chance 
                  the player receives an additional hit. You need not be
                  in combat to successfully cast this spell.
   formula:       (lvl * 2 - lvl_of_target) * 100 / 60 % chance of success.

   [Note: Might be nice to clear out some dangers without losing much hp...

FIREBALL
   spell-level:   10
   sp cost:       20 points
   effect:        This spell is different from the fireball in player.c.
                  Fireball is an attack spell that hits all livings in the
                  same room as the caster, execpt those that are grouped
                  with the caster. Damage is resisted with wis. Fireball
                  gives experience equal to the damage done.
   formula:       damage = 10 + random(20) points.

   [Note: The fireball in player.c can be cast from level 15 and up, costs
    20 sp and does random(40) damage, which is resisted with wis. Better 
    compare these stats with the 'blast' spell. Uglymouth.]

FIRESHIELD
   spell-level:   10
   sp cost:       50 points
   effect:        Fireshield creates an object that shadows the hit_player
                  function. If the player gets hit for a certain amount of
                  damage, the shield also hits the attacker for twice that
                  amount, if it's of type 5 or 7 in hit_player().
   formula:       fireshield lasts for: lvl * 60 seconds.

GATE
   spell-level:   20
   sp cost:       100 points
   effect:        Gate puts a gate-object in the room of the target-player.

                  time it can be entered by anyone in the room. Somebody
                  that enters the gate is moved to the room from which the
                  spell was cast.

GOGUILD
   spell-level:   2
   sp cost:       10 points
   effect:        Goguild teleports the player back to the guild.
                  It memorizes the filename from which it's cast, so it
                  used in the 'goback' spell.

GOBACK
   spell-level:   3
   sp cost:       20 points
   effect:        Goback teleports the player back to the site from where
                  the 'goguild' spell was cast the last time. It is not
                  necessary for this spell to be cast from the same room 
                  the player was teleported to by 'goguild'.

HOLD
   spell-level:   5
   sp cost:       20 points
   effect:        Hold sets the hold-flag in the target-living for a certain
                  period of time. The duration is dependent of the levels of
                  the player and the target, and if the target is another
                  player or a monster.
   formulas:      player: time = 2*random(10*(lvl+1)/level_of_target)
                  npc   : time = 2*random(10*(lvl+1)/((level_of_target+1)/2))
                  time is the duration of the spell in heart_beats.

ILLUSION
   spell-level:   9
   sp cost:       50 points
   effect:        Illusion creates a thing-object that can be shaped (short
                  and long description) as the player wishes. The illusion
                  can not be picked up or moved.
   formula:       the illusion lasts for: (lvl/2 + random(lvl/2)) * 60 sec.

   effect:        Knock magically unlocks a door. The door must be

   sp cost:       5 points

MISSILE
   spell-level:   5
   sp cost:       15 points
   effect:        This 'missile' spell is different from the 'missile' in

                  can not escape from it, exept by quitting. In the prison
                  the victim can loose 500 coins to a teasing imp. There's
                  a board in the prison to say how much you just love it.

   sp cost:       80 points
   effect:        Tame stops an opponent from attacking the caster. If the
                  target is aggressive (npc only), it still will not attack 
                  the player once he enters the room a next time.
   formula:       chance of success = lvl - lvl_of_target + 50 percent.

TELEPORT
   spell-level:   20
   sp cost:       50 points
   effect:        Teleport teleports a player back to a site that was first
                  marked by the 'memorize' spell.

MEMORIZE
   spell-level:   20
   sp cost:       10 points
