// Maps go from top to down.. Map0 will be the top one.. the next map
// will be one level lower.. If rooms are 'on top' of eachother, there
// will be an up and down passage generated. That is if the coordinates
// are marked. Marking is done as by the following example:
// [map3, 0]
// [2,2, "up", down]   2,2 leads up with exit-string "up" to map2 and down with
// 		       exit-string "down" to map4.. that is if there are rooms there
// [3,1, "climb up", ""]  3,1 only leads up with string "climb up"
//
// 0 1 2233
// 
// 1 A   A < 3,1
// 1  \ /
// 2   A  < this one is marked with coordinates 2,2 so define up and down 
// 2  / \
// 3 A   A
// The values behind the mapname, are the initial values of the upperleft zero in the map.
// This allows to only enter a smal piece of a map, even if the values of x and y would
// ne high.. ( 0, 0 ) gives the 0 in the map the value 0,0.. If it had been (25, 23 )
// the 0 would have been set on coordinate value 25,23
