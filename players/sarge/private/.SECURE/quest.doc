For the quest to return the heart, you must work your way through a misty maze
that is never the same maze twice. When at the gate you must search the mist
to find a trapdoor, open the trapdoor, and go down. You must work your way
further in the maze to the Denizen's temple and get the heart from the altar.
Then you must kill the denizen alone (if 2 people fight he will not die).
When he is dead you may proceed north and get the sword.
The level of both the Denizen and the sword is dependant upon the person.
When you have the sword you may cut, slice, impale, stick, spear or stab the
heart. That will complete the quest.
