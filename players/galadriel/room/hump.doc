changes made to humpbacked bridge:

- exit to Wolfi's area is still "down", but the description is changed
  from "path south" to "path north".
- new track leads "southeast" along the riverbank.
- description for track.
- description for river bank.

comment on Wolfi's:

  in his area most of the exits lead north, northeast, northwest, so its
  more likely that you slide "down" to the northside of the bridge.
  besides that it doesnt matter much what the desc is, couse his command
  is still "down".
  if i remember correctly, his area was originally also north but
  changed when the millquest was installed there. Since then, mill has
  moved to the other side (southwest) so Wolfi's, is back where it was.
