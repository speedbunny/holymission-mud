Heya Galadriel :-)

I promised you to tell you what a fungus consists of or what
can be done with it, here I am:

STATIC INITIALISATIONS:
  integer picked_from_the_ground = 0;
  integer tasted = 0;

DESCRIPTIONS
  short       "a orange-red fungus"
  cap         "the cap is bright orange-read & rather flat.\n"
  underside   "it is thickly covered with beautiful yellow gills\n"
  stem        "it yellow with a skiny yellow ring\n"
  ring        "it is skiny and has same colour as the stem\n"
  long        if (picked_from_the_ground)
                 cap + underside + stem
              else  cap + stem

  heal          17
  stuff         5
  few_poison    1
  raw_poison    4
  poison        0
  intoxicaton   0   (only a few mushrooms intoxicate like alcohol)
  time          300
  weight        1
  value         24
  smell        "it smells fruity"
  taste        "it tastes mild"

ACTIONS
  smell_it    return smell
  taste_it    - call_out "get_poisoned(few_poison)",time)
              value=9*value/10;
              weight=9*weight/10;
              tasted+=1;
              return taste
              
  spit_out    if (tasted)
                 - remove_call_out ("get_poisoned")
                 tasted=0
 
  cook/prepare food from fungus: raw_poison = 0;
  
  eat         if (raw_poison + poison)
              - call_out "get_poisoned(raw_poison + poison",time)
              add_intoxication (intoxication)
              (how to handle stuff? )
              destruct fungus

  pick        if (!picked_from_the_ground)
              "you carefully pick " + short;
              transfer (this_object,this_player)
              picked_from_the_ground=1;

get_poisoned (amount)
   this_player->add_poison (amount)

********************************************
Maybe you will now say that is neither a brainstorming
nor pseudocode nor anything else, it is just what I
think is necessary for fungi in a forest of mine.
I do not think i should make it dependent on the
players outfit id he can make fire or has a pan to
prepare food. sure it would be more realistic to 
query if a torch is present - but noone asks if 
the player has matches or a flintstone to light
it up, so i wont ask how he manages it to prepare
food. it would be enough if he himself finds out
that they are edible if cooked.

would you manage it so that each of the values
can be queried from outside so that a player
could perhaps show the fungus to a scientistic
fungus station where he can get info for a small
fee: edible or poisonous?
