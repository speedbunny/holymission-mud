ADVANCE:
   To advance as monk you need to have combat and questexperience.
   Then any 2 levels you have to win a heroic fight, before you 
   really can advance. When you are ready to advance, you can see
   it in your upper line when there is a *.

   For example when yo get:

        Sleepy in HOLY MISSION you can't and if you get 
        Sleepy in HOLY MISSION* you can advance :*)
