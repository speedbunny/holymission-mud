   block <victim> before or under the fight.

ART:
   block is the ability to hinder the opponent to run away
   from fight. A successful skillroll will stop the victim
   from leaving your environment for some rounds. To block

   the monsters attemt to flee, while your friend fights it.
   Block works 'very weak' against players.
