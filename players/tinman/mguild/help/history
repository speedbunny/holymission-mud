HISTORY:

Long time ago as Mandos build the first humanoids the Gnomes, Humans
Hobbits, Elves and Dwarves. The evil God Sauron build the Trolls,
Giants and Orcs. This strong evil races began then to attack and kill
the other humanoids, especially the Elves.

In fact the Elves and Half-elves where disliked by most good races,
because of their strange arrogant behaviour. But at this time there
was the need to make partnership against Saurons followers.

At this time, there was no need of Paladins or other noble Fighters,
because weapons and armours where rare. So people build up a guild,
training the unarmed combat and special defence without armours.
They learned the secret of curing and some of them learned how to 
write magic scrolls.

Since this guild was build, it was a wall against the dark armies
of Sauron and a place of peace and prayings. Helping , healing,
friendship and respecting law was always the mayor task of this 
guild of the Blue Order as the close relationship to their gods.
