 Skills:

 Since skills can be somewhat you won't loose after changing guilds and
I can't check the armour via shadow then, I will make some skills
  depending on the weight of the player. max_carriable_weight/weight

  Legends:
  When the installed system (lib) suits ok.... hmm also to guildprotectors
   ill change mine.

  Leaving Guild:
 Some skills will be lost then

 Combat_shad:
 Needs a recode its confusing a bit.

                       Thats all :)
