The new testplayer-system is suposed to make testing easier, and prevent
some nasty guys from cheating. ;-)
So if you need a player to test your area/items/... use a testplayer.
You are NOT allowed any further to test your areas, items, ...
using a normal player!!!

There are some special commands for testplayers:
	heal			..heal himself
	setlevel <nr>		..set the level to nr
	setguild <name>		..set the guild to name
	setguild <nr>		..set the guild to nr
	setstat <statname> <nr> ..set a specific stat (eg. str) to nr
        pray			..pray anytime
	goto <filename>		..teleport to <filename>
The folloing are the same the known apprentice-wizard commands.
	peace			pwd
	ls <path>		cd <path>
	more <filename>		cat <filename>
	tail <filename>

To make a testplayer you have to generate a NEW character, and then the
wizard can make him to his testplayer using the 'testplayer'-command.
NOTE: You have to reconnect with the testplayer to gain the additional
      commands. You are not allowed to attack a player with your
      testplayer. A newwizard is able to trans his testplayer wherever 
      he wants.

YOU MUST NOT USE YOUR TEST PLAYER TO HELP OTHER PLAYERS, OR TO KILL THEM
OR HARM THEM IN ANY WAY. DOING THIS WILL BE CONSIDERED TO BE EQUIVALENT TO
USING YOUR WIZARD CHARACTER TO HELP PLAYERS OR TO HARM OR KILL THEM. ABUSE
OF TEST PLAYERS WILL RESULT IN BANISHMENT OF YOUR WIZARD CHARACTER.
