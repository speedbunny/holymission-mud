To start a wedding you need to have a wizard present.
The wizard should type 'marry <player1> and <player2>'.
From then on the service is fairly self-evident.
Don't speak up during the service, the preacher might think that you have a 
reason to stop it!
A wedding costs 5000 coins - this cannot be paid for by a wizard.
For a list of all performed weddings, type "weddinglist".
Since this wedding chapel was made in honour of the god Illuvatar, weddings are
only possible if both players are followers of him. To become a follower of 
Illuvatar, just pray in the church, south of here.
Weddings can only be done between players who are old enough, i.e. level five
or higher.
