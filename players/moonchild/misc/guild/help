Barbarians, naturally, can't wear chainmail or other metal armours, and tend
to be more at home wielding a club or an axe than a a sword. Experienced
barbarians tend to be faster in combat than normal warriors, and can often
manage to get in two or three blows where a normal warrior would only manage
one.

In addition to the standard stats, Barbarians have four additional skills,
combat, melee, fortitude and speed. It's up to you to find out what they do.
Barbarians stand very close to their gods. They always try to live up to
their gods beliefs. Thus you will need to maintain the alignment side of
the deity you followed when you joined (either nice and better, or nasty
and worse). If you don't do that, the gods will hinder your progress.
