Well we all know what makes the flowers grow -
But we don't know why
And we all have the knowledge of DNA -
But we still die
We perch so thin and fragile here -
Upon the land
And the earth that moves beneath us -
We don't understand

So now we rush towards the judgement day -
When She reclaims
A toast to the Luddite martys then -
Who died in vain
Down at the lab, they're working still -
Finishing off
How do we tell the people in the white coats -
Enough is enough
How do we tell the people in the white coats -
Enough is enough is enough is enough

Hey, hey, I listen to you pray
As if some help will come
Hey, hey, She will dance on our graves
When we are dead and gone

You and I we made no suicide pact -
We didn't want to die
But we watch the wall, little darling -
While the chemical trucks go by
This desperate imitation now
Of innocence
The last few days at Jonestown

Hey, hey, I listen to you pray
As if some help will come
Hey, hey, She will dance on our graves
When we are dead and gone

Beneath the fitted carpets
Beyond the padded cells
Within these crimes of passion
The naked truth She dwells
And this fury's just a part
And the desire is just a part
The cracking ice, the splitting rock

Hey, hey, I listen to you pray
As if some help will come
Hey, hey, She will dance on our graves
When we are dead and gone

Hey, hey, to the suicide day
The blind man blunders on
Hey, hey, She will dance on our graves
When we are dead and gone

As children learn about the world
We built that wall of sand
Along the beach we laboured hard
With our bare hands
We worked until the sun went down
Beneath the waves
As the tide came rolling, splashing in
Washed the wall away

How do we tell the people in the white coats -
Enough is enough
How do we tell the people in the white coats -
Enough is enough is enough is enough
