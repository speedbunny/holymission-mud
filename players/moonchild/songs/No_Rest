Four o'clock in the morning
And still we cannot sleep
Turning over turning round
Twisting in our sweat
There is no rest for the wicked ones
Dear God what have we've done?
There is no rest for the wicked ones
Dear God what is this evil that we've done?
There is no rest for the wicked ones
Dear God what is this evil that we've done?

Is it that we wanted more than you gave?
Why did you put us then in this smalltown grave?
Humility - is that what you want?
Why did you make us then the way you did?
Yes we have pride? Yes we have pride!
Is this our sin? Is this our sin?

Four o'clock in the morning
And still we cannot sleep
Turning over turning round
Twisting in our sweat
There is no rest for the wicked ones
Dear God what have we done?
There is no rest for the wicked ones
Dear God what is this evil that we've done?

Is it the time that we've been out fighting?
Well I'll tell you all those times
We never really hurt anybody
Or is it that we were eating
While other people were starving?
Is this our crime? Is this our crime?

Four o'clock in the morning
And still we cannot sleep
Turning over turning round
Twisting in our swear
There is no rest for the wicked ones
Dear God what have we done?
There is no rest for the wicked ones
Dear Lord what is this evil that we've done?

Is it the time we laughed about it all?
Through all those whisky night so far away
Yes we betrayed you! Yes we betrayed you!
Is this our crime? Is this our crime?

Four o'clock in the morning
And still we cannot sleep
Turning over turning round
Twisting in our sweat
There is no rest for the wicked ones
Dear God what have we done?
There is no rest for the wicked ones
Dear God what is this evil that we must have done?
