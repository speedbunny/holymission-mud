Right now, hahahahaha

I am an antichrist
I am an anarchist

Dont know what I want
But I know how to get it
I wanna destroy, the passerby

Cause I wanna be anarchy
No dog's body

Anarchy for the UK
Its coming sometime, it might be
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic light
Your future dream is a shopping spree

Cause I, I wanna be anarchy
In the city

Of many ways to get what to what you want
I use the best
I use the rest
I use the enemy
I use anarchy

Cause I wanna be anarchy
Its the only way to be

Is this MPLA?
Or is this the UDA?
Or is this the IRA?
I thought it was the UK
Or just another country
And other cunt-like tendencies

I wanna be anarchy
And I wanna be anarchy
You know what I mean
And I wanna be anarchist
Again I'm pissed
DESTROY!
