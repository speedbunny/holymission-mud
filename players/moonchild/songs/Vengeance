Escaped the net in '45
Hiding out in South America
Protected by money and powerful friends
Hoping the world has forgotten by now
All the things you did in the Nazi death camps
The thousands you tortured and killed
You can live your life in expectant fear
Until the day when you're made to pay

I believe in justice
I believe in vengeance
I believe in getting the bastard
Getting the bastard, getting the bastard

Man walks over dressed in flashy clothes
With an empty heart and a head full of money
Puts his arm around the lad of fifteen years
Talks sort of close like a long-lost brother
"It's really cool all the pop stars do
 If you don't try it you'd really be a fool
 Tell you what I'll do, I'll make the first one free
 And when you want some more just come back to me"

I believe in justice
I believe in vengeance
I believe in getting the bastard
Getting the bastard, getting the bastard

Top-dog fascist gets the boys in the corner
Plants poison where there was just confusion
Walks away scot-free and laughing
Rides on the tide as the cancer grows
And the businessman on corruption charges
With millions of dollars in dirty money
Gets a thousand pound fine after months in court
While the lawyers get fat and the law gets poor

I believe in justice
I believe in vengeance
I believe in getting the bastard
Getting the bastard, getting the bastard
Now!
