The time I think most clearly
The time I drift away
Is on the busride that meanders
Up these valleys of green and grey
I get to think about what might have been
And what may yet come true
And I get to pass a rainy mile
Thinking of you
And all the while, all the while
I still hear that call
To the land of gold and poison
That beckons to us all

Nothing changes here very much
I guess you'd say it never will
The pubs are all full on Friday nights
And things get started still
We spent hours last week with Billy boy
Bleeding, yeah queueing casualty
Staring at those posters we used to laugh at
Never never land, palm trees by the sea

Well there was no need for those guys
To hurt him so bad
When all they had to do
Was knock him down
But no-one asks too many questions like that
Since you left this town

And tomorrow brings another train
Another young brave steals away
But you're the one I remember
From these valleys of green and grey

You used to talk about winners and losers
All the time - as if that was all there was
As if we were not of the same blood family
As if we live by different laws
Do you owe so much less to these rainswept hills
Than you did to your good self
Is it true that the world has always got to be
Something that always seems to happen - somewhere else

For God's sake don't you realise
That I still hear that call
Do you think you're so brave
Just to go running
To that which beckons to us all

And tomorrow brings another train
Another young brave steals away
But you're the one I remember
From these valleys of green and grey

No, not for one second
Did you look behind you
As you were walking away
Never once did you wish any of us well
Thost who had chosen to stay
And if that's what it takes to make it
In the place where you live today
Then I guess you'll never read these letters that I send
From the valleys of green and of the grey
The valleys of the green and of the grey
