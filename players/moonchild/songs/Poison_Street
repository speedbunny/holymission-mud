We were singing in the rain
Like we invented singing
There's a light in the sky
From a million street lights
And we danced all the steps
From all those old time movies
Rolling down the hill
With laughing hearts

In Poison Street they guard the gates
With bitter, bitter thoughts
In Poison Street we'll laugh out loud
Till the shadows go melt away

And I love you now
Like I love you always ever
Kissing in the dark
Like a couple of kids
You gave me life
You gave me light and thunder
Like a blind man sees
For the very first time

In Poison Street we'll go crashing
Through the walls history made for us
In Poison Street we'll spring the traps
And race away

So just a kick
For this dark damned city of ours
And just a kiss
Yeah a kiss from you
And just a drink
A toast to the days to come
Now that Poison Street won't break us any more

We were singing in the rain
Yeah, like we wrote that song
There's a light in the sky
From the streetlights all around
You gave me life
You gave me light and thunder
Like a man makes fire
For the very first time

In Poison Street we'll go crashing
Through the walls history made for us
In Poison Street we'll laugh out loud
Till the shadows go melt away

So just a kick
For this dark damned city of ours
And just a kiss
Yeah a kiss from you
And just a drink
A toast to the days to come
Now that Poison Street won't break us any more
Now that Poison Street can't touch us any more
