How does it feel
To treat me like you do
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are
Thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now how do I feel

Those who came before me
Lived trough bad locations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
I still find it so hard
To say what I need to say
When I watch what I should tell me
Just how I should feel today

I see a ship in the harbour
Like in a shallow bay
But if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
When I thought I heard you speak
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now how should I feel

Now I stand here waiting

I thought I'd told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold
