We follow the tail-lights out of the city
Moving in a fiver of red
As the colours fade away from the dusky sunset
We roll for the darkness ahead

We are old, we are young
We are in this together
Vagabonds and children
Prisoners forever
With pulses a-raging
And eyes full of wonder
Kicking out behind us again

Night-time City Beat the radio is calling
The lost and the lonely in vain
Out here we are running for the wide open spaces
The roadsmell after the rain

We are old, we are young
We are in this together
Vagabonds and children
Prisoners forever
With pulses a-raging
And eyes full of wonder
Kicking out behind us again

And watching as a boy alone at the quayside
The ships loading cargo in the night
Their names all calling to faraway places
The years go past, the miles go by
And still this childhood romance will not die...
