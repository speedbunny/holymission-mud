I sit at my table and wage war on myself
It seems like it's all for nothing.
I know the barricades, and
I know the mortar in the wall breaks
I recognise the weapons, I've used them well
I've a rich understanding of my finest defenses
I proclaim that claims are left unstated,
I demand a rematch,
I decree a stalemate.
I divine my deeper motives,
I recognize the weapons.
I've practiced them myself, I fitted them myself.
It's amazing what devices you can sympathise, empathize.
This is my mistake, let me make it good.
I raised the wall and I will be the one to knock it down.

Reach out for me, hold me tight, hold that memory.
Let my machine talk to me. Let my machine talk to me.

This is my world, and
I am World Leader Pretend.
This is my life, and
This is my time.
I have been given the freedom to do as I see fit.
It's high time I razed the walls that I've constructed.
It's amazing what devices you can sympathise, empathize.
This is my mistake, let me make it good.
I raised the wall and I will be the one to knock it down.
You fill in the mortar.
You fill in the harmony.
You fill in the mortar.
You fill in the harmony.
I raised the wall and I will be the one to knock it down.
