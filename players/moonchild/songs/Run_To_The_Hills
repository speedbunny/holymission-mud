The white man came across the sea,
He brought Us pain and misery
He killed Our tribes He killed Our creed,
He took Our game for His own need
We fought Him hard We fought Him well,
Out on the plains We gave him Hell
But many came too much for Cree,
Oh will We ever be set free?
 
Riding through dustclouds and barren wastes,
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the red skins back to their homes,
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom a stab in the back,
Women and children and cowards attack
 
Run to the hills
Run for your life
Run to the hills
Run for your life
 
Soldier blue in the barren wastes,
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men,
The only good Injuns are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold,
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Run to the hills
Run for your life
Run to the hills
Run for your life
