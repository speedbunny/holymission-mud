Her name was Julie
When she took me for a ride
In her old Chevrolet
Straight into a dusty sundown
I knew
She was gonna make up one of her stories
And then she couldn't believe it
When I told her
How much I loved her lies
And how much I loved her games

Riding on the highway
You know you're much too far
You're lying so much better
When you drive a car
You're lying to the sundown
So look into my face

You're lying
(I love it)
You're lying
(I love it)
You're lying
(I love it)
You're lying
(I love it)
You're lying

I love your games
I love your lies
I love your games
Look in my eyes
Take me in your arms
And hold me tight just for tonight
I need no drugs
I love your lies
You hide me from the light
You're lying
I'm buying
I'm buying every word

I love your lies
I love your games

Take me to the ballroom
We're dancing through the night
I'm in your arms
I love your lies
They make me feel so right
You're lying to your shadow
So look into my face

You're lying
(I love it)
You're lying
(I love it)
You're lying
(I love it)
You're lying
(I love it)
You're lying

Julie stopped her car
The sun had gone and had left one of these dark red skies
She looked in my eyes and with a smile on her face she said
'Of course I'm lying
 But I think I love you'

Riding on the highway
You know you're much too far
You're lying so much better
When you drive a car
You're lying to the sundown
So look into my face

You're lying
(I love it)
You're lying
(I love it)
