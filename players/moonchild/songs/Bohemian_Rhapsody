Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
Little high, little low,
Anyway the wind blows,
Doesn't really matter to me
To me...

Mamma, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mamma, life has just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mamma, ooo -
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sent shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mamma, ooo -
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very very frightning me -
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - Magnifico -
I'm just a poor boy
Nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity -
Easy come, easy go,
Will you let me go -
Bismillah!  No -
We will not let you go - let him go -
Bismillah!  No -
We will not let you go - let him go -
Bismillah!
We will not let you go - let him go -
Will not let you go - let me go -
Will not let you go - let me go -
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Mama mia, mama mia,
Mama mia let me go -
Beelzebub has a devil put aside
For me, for me,
For me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby - Can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me -

Any way the wind blows...
