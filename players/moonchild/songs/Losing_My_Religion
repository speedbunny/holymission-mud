Oh, life it's bigger,
It's bigger that you and you are not me 
The lengths that I will go to,
The distance in your eyes
Oh no I've said too much,
I set it up

That's me in the corner,
That's me in the spotlight, losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much,
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing,
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blind and bull fool
Oh no I've said too much,
I set it up

Consider this,
Consider this a hint of the century, 
Consider this, a slip that brought me to my knees, pale
What if all these fantasies come flailing around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing,
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try
 
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner,
That's me in the spotlight, losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much,
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing,
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, fly, and try
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream
Dream
