I'm a lumberjack and I'm ok
I sleep all night and I work all day

I cut down trees, I eat my lunch
I go to the lav-a-try
I Wednesdays I go shopping
And have buttered scones for tea.

I'm a lumberjack and I'm ok
I sleep all night and I work all day

I cut down trees, I skip and jump
I like to press wild flowers
I put on women's clothing and hang around in bars

Im a lumberjack and I'm ok
I sleep all night and I work all day

I cut down trees, I wear high heels,
Suspenders and a bra
I wish I'd been a girlie, just like my dear Papa

Oh, I though you were so RUGGED
