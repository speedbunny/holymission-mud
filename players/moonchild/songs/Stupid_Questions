It's not a crime to be innocent
These things we have not done
But you're not some little child
Spring is past and gone

Well I know my craving heart
And I've seen your vicious eyes
And I think we know the truth
Both you and I
Don't flutter your lashes like a little girl
And ask me why it's such cruel cruel world, no

Don't ask any more stupid questions
You already know the answers to

Well you can kill with the best of them
But your smile remains so sweet
When someone comes to eat me alive
Well I like, I like to see their teeth
If you really want I can name the names
Be an angel of death at the children's games, so

Don't ask any more stupid questions
You already know the answers to

Well I know that you do
There comes a time in your life
You've got to grow up fast
And I think that your time
Is coming now here at last

It's not a crime to be innocent
These things we have not done
But you cannot run forever
Spring is past and gone

Waiting in line at the fortune teller
Waiting to hear some more pretty lies, he says

Don't ask any more stupid questions
You already know the answers to
