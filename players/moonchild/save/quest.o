This is not fair.\n- The increase of %rating of players that didnt do the rm'ed quest could\n  be big enough to lift them to the needed %rating to wiz!\n- there are so few quests left, that the time to do the needed %rating is\n  too short and too many players will wiz too fast.\n\n+ IF: remove the area...\n- it is a big area and HM will be much smaller afterwards.\n- players liked the area and will not like it that it is gone.\n\n+ IF: make it harder...\n- The players who _want to do it_ don't like it.\n\n+ IF: reduce the quest points...\n- The players who _did it already_ don't like it.\n- The total amouth of questpoints in HM goes down so people who did it\n  go down but people who didn't do it go up in %rating\n\n+ IF: change the quest to have a different solution...\n  OR: change the quest so it doesnt have always the same solution...\n- The wiz doesnt want it changed.\n- The wiz doesnt have the time.\n- This quest can simply not have different solution.\n\n\nSome points on unhappy players:\n===============================\n- Players can be very upset about things. They can complain about very small\n  and virtually unimportant matters and also they can complain about things\n  that are really important.\n- Many times players are not mad about the change itself, but rather the\n  way they feel treated by wizards.\n- Players don't like big changes.\n- Players don't like unexpectant changes.\n- Players don't like unexplained changes.\n\nSome points on unhappy wizzes:\n==============================\n- Wizzes are often proud of the areas and quests they created. If their\n  quest is disconnected they will usually not be happy.\n- Wizzes can talk and think for themselves. First thing should be to\n  explain to the wiz that his quest needs to be changed or removed,\n  and then ask the wiz if (s)he agrees on that, instead of just doing\n  the removal and telling the wiz afterwards.\n- Wizzes get annoyed if you rm their code, better disconnect it only\n  and give them the possibility to backup the code.\n- If the wiz doesnt agree, try to find out why. (S)he could have a good\n  story, instead of just being stubborn. So always _listen_ to her/him.\n- Most wizzes are sensible enough to cooperate. There could be reached\n  an arrangement to change the quest instead of removing it.\n- There could be the arrangement that the wiz codes a new better quest\n  instead of this one.\n\nSome wild idea's:\n=================\n+ Players don't loose the points of a removed quest.\n+ Players that loose a set quest get another quest set without doing it.\n+ Players get a dummy quest with the points of the removed quest.\n+ Players that did a quest thats will be removed, recieve something else\n  instead of the questpoints they loose. example: A autoload badge,\n  an item that will help a bit while questing or has some other nice\n  feature.\n+ Dont change,add,remove more than one quest in 3 weeks.\n  . This way people will have time to get used to new %ratings.\n  . The %ratings dont change spectacularly, causing an outburst of anger\n    or tens of new wizzes.\n+ Don't decrease the number of quests. So only remove an old quest if a\n  new one is installed. Of course the number can increase as more wizzes\n  code quests.\n+ Don't change the total number of quest points in HM. So a quest can be\n  removed if other with the same total amount get installed.\n\n\n\n**\nI figured out how Q's quest works with the character locks. Why not\nuse them to code quests. Sure it'll be more work and it would take\nquite a bit more coding but if you cannot bother to make a good\nquest then the quest shouldn't be coded at all. I think you should\nalso rotate the quests around. I agree that some quests are weighed\ntoo heavily. Who gives a damn about easy quests like pardone's, \norc slayer, and the like? I'm not exactly sure but at least one of\nthe easy quests is worth too much in my opinion.\nI'm working on Alex's area and recoding everything. It's going to\nbe a good quest I know. If anyone could help out, check out\n/players/colossus/room.c It's a room environment I'm trying to\nmake to make his quest better. Too many repititious rooms without\nanything special makes it boring.\n\nColossus\n\n\n**\nI read Kbl's note on quest continuation. Maybe it could be possible to\narrange a gathering of all wizards concerning coding future quests and\nmaybe make them coincide and link them. For example:\nDestroy Lolth the evil spider queen and to do that you have to:\n1. Create the famous Drow Slayer (half of the quests)\n2. To actually kill Lolth (another half of the quest)\n\nJust a suggestion\nColossus\n\n\n**\nFirst i wanted to start with Re: questdoc1 of Galadriel\n\nA) I think when a quest or area is imported it shouldn't stay on the Holy\nMission. This mud isn't supposed to be a copy of many muds.\nI think you should code creative or don't code at all.\n\nB) I don't think it is necessary to remove a quest completly\n(with some exceptions). When a quest of an area is removed (temp) often\nan area can still be a normal nice area with some changes. Not one\nwizard has more than one quest on the possible removal list. So they\ncould find time to change it in the way it is possible to place the \nquest back in time.\nOne remark about the exceptions I mentioned before: There's one\ncertain area where not one wiz is happy about. He's a big memory eater\nand left bad feeling wiht a lot of ppl. His 2 quests  should be removed\n_and_ (cause the area contains some important things) his area should be\ntaken over by anohter wiz who 1) cares about the monks 2) sure will change\nthis area in a normal _non_ sexual area. But that is not the question now.\n\nC) When a guest is too easy:\nA quest is never to easy or to hard. Ther must be quests in every category\nSo a level 2 player must be able to find a quest he can solve. The only\nthing that canbe wrong is that the given quest points don't match the level \nof the quest.\n\nD) if the solutions are known:\nThis kind of quests should be (temporarly) removed. With these quests the \nplayers just follow the information told by others. Togheter with the coden \nthere should be decided if the area is changed to a non quest area or if the \nquest gets serious changes.\nYou shouldn't remove a quest for ever. I think the best solution on this\nquest matter is to let the quests rolate. (change from time to time)\n\n2] CATEGORIES\n\nwith 33 quests you could easily make groups of 5 quests :\nvery easy quests -> \"E\" quests\neasy quests -> \"D\" quests\na bit hard quests -> \"C\" quests\nhard quests -> \"B\" quests\nvery hard quests -> \"A\" quests\n\nYou should solve 4 of the 5 quests of each category.\nWith a log file you could count how many players have solved the quest. When \npar exemple 10 or 15 players solved the quest it could be replaced by a quest\nof the same category. This way you also don't have the problem with\nangry wizards. There are not 'real' removals. The 'removed' quests are\nplaced in a 'waitinglist'. So the area is still open and players can still\nsolve the quest but _bad luck_, if they are not smart enought to read the \nlist and follow the instructions told by others, they don't get any points.\nWhen a new quests is coded some wizards should play it and decide in which\ncategory it belongs. Then it is added immediatly and the oldest\nor most solved quest is placed in the waitinglist. This way\nit can take some time b 4 an old quest reenters. This also gives the coders\nof the quests in the waitinglist time to update or improve it.\n\n3] % RATING\n\nWith this new system there should be a way to change it all without making the\nde\\increase more than 20%\nThen there will not be in their list or score: You have a rating of x%.\nBut: YOu need 4 quests in each category. YOu have now:\nx A, x B, x C ect ect\nWith this system (which i would love to code but I'm not good enough for)\nwill not give problems when there comes in a new quest.\nWhen a player solved a certain number of a certain category that number\nwill not increase when the quest disappears from the list to the waiting\nlist. This way there will be no unhappy players in the future:\nThey get various quests and can choose often.\nThen there is only the problem left wiht the %rating when the switch is made.\nI think it is possible to count like following:\n OLD % RATING            NEW SYSTEM\n\n0-5                     1 quest\n6-9 %                       2\n10-13                       3\n14-17                       4\n18-21                       5\n22-25                       6\n26-29                       7\nect ect \n72-75                       18\n76-79                       19\n80-83                       20\nEct ect\nThis way the old 80 % will be equal to 20 quests which equals 80% of\n25 quests.\nThere should be some discussions how these quest are shared among the \ndifferent categories\nWhen the waitinglist gets too long we could increase the number of quests\nin each categories and the amount of quests to be solved (but this wouldn't\n come up untill there would be more than 50 quests)\n\n4] \tLIST - WAITINGLIST\n\nThis last chapter will need a lot of discussion ( if u all like the plan)\nI made the following possible list:\nCat A (very hard) 1 Free king dimitri\n                   2 Destroy Haunter\nCat B (hard)     1 quench evil hellfire\n                 2 make sad girl happy\n                 3 help elfcity\nCat C            a vampire quest\n                 2 retrieve black orb\nCat D            1 make dinner for druid lakmir\n                  2 abby of the rose\nCat E            1 walking castle\n\nThese categories I choose on own experience\nFor the rest I had in mind:\n(could be placed on waitinglist)\nSave holy mission Cat E\nget orcslayer Cat E\nGoblinquest Cad D\nTrollslayer Cad D or E\nRatsquest Cad D\nKings head Cat C\nGanja seeds Cad D\ncerberos victim Cad D or C\nchaosblade of death cat b\nearth quest Cat E\n\nThe rest of the quest (7 left) I didn't do so I couldn't\njudge their categories.\nThe quest not include are:\nAsk_god it is the only compulsory quest there will be\nMill_quest and witchquest see chapter 1B\ntotal newbie quest maybe the newbies could use money or experience more\n\nAs last remark I din't want to insult any of the wizards. If I did i offer that\nwizard my apoligize.\n\nGreeting ,\nLovely Berenice\n\n\n**\nI have done most of the quests on this MUD, with the exception of Gnome King,\nIsland dragon, AnySlayer, Viking and Cure Dwarf.  Let me comment on the\nremaining quests, in descending order of difficulty:\n1) Haunter of the Dark:  excellent quest, many difficult puzzles, a bit of hack\n'n slash in the beginning.  This quest would be ideal if there were a few\nmore clues as to how to start it - right now, just FINDING the area\nis unlikely.  There's a note in the well in the mountains of madness - that\nnote (and well) should perhaps be moved down into the moors somewhere (near\nthe farmhouse, for instance?)\n4) Vampire king: this and elfcity are the last remnants of the old HM\n\"hack & slash\" style quests.  With the effective removal of stonefish fangs,\nthis quest is extremely difficult and time-consuming for certain character\nclasses.  As it offers very little in the way of puzzles to solve, and as\nthe solution is widely known, I would suggest that its rating and the monsters\nincorporated in it be both greatly reduced.\n5) Orb quest: this has better clues, much less fighting, and a bit more\nproblem-solving than the vampire quest.  As far as I know, it is rarely\nsolved, and I have never seen a mailnote with its solution.  I would keep\nit as it is.\n6)  Hellfire: this quest is also widely known, and the puzzles are pretty\nstraightforward.  The baal-rog, however, is a real player-killer, as its\nroom does not permit wimpying.  I would suggest that the baal-rog's strength\nbe halved, the room modified to permit wimpy to work (players die of lag, which\nis not their fault), and the quest % should be reduced.\n7) Elfcity:  This quest is also based on hack 'n slash, with the sea drake and\nthe evil elf (who now appears to follow players) being the two bad examples.\nDanahara is almost unkillable, and her room doesn't permit wimpy- however,\nthere is a way around this problem which is not documented in any mailnote\nI've seen.  I would keep this quest at its current rating, but degrade the\nstrength of the evil elf and the sea drake to perhaps 1/3 their current\nstrength\n10) Dimitri: again, Moonchild has written a fine quest which has too few\nclues about how to begin.  Sleeping in the tree should be more specific about\nwhat is needed, and perhaps a hint about magic snakes living far underground\nwould be appropriate.\n11) Make girl happy: this quest's solution is widely known, its puzzles are\nnot terribly intuitive, and the \"drop weapons\" requirement is a killer for\nthe Ninjas (who lose their autoloading weapons if dropped).  It should be\nmodified and the no-weapon requirement should be removed.\n13) Abbey: I don't know why this is rated so high.  There is essentially only\nONE puzzle in the whole quest, and its solution (the burnished door) is\nwidely known.  It should be changed or degraded (%) or both.\n14)  Quest perilous: I actually liked this quest quite a bit - it had some\nkilling, some puzzle-solving, and the clues were sufficient to finish the\nquest without giving it away.  I would leave it as-is.\n15)  Good King's head: the solution to this is known, though not widely,\nand the mutating maze is very hard unless you know the direction sequence\nto get through it.  Other than that, a good quest.\n16)  Evil troll king: No clues as to how to start this one either (are you\nlistening, Moonchild??).  Other than that, straight hack 'n slash, with the\ntrollking being particularly vicious.  I'd lower the fighting strength of\nthe trollking and the 3 trolls slightly, and change the beginning part to\nbe a little more involved and intuitive than drinking from a poison stream.\n17)  Chaosdemon: excellent quest, silver dragon shouldn't be so hard.  Solution\nis WIDELY known as this quest appears on other MUDs.  Depending on how often\nthis one gets solved, it could be left, degraded or eliminated.\n18)  Hermit: straight hack 'n slash, complicated now by the fact that Moonie\nhas moved the hermit.  I would reduce the number of goblin scalps to 10 and/or\nkeep them from wimpying (this is REALLY annoying on this MUD, as wimpying\nmonsters get the first attack when you chase them - bug?).\n19)  Lakmir quest: good quest, nice trick with the rug.  No changes.\n20)  Evil time maze: put the hut in more accessable places (who will ever find\nit up in Moonchild's frostgiant wastelands??), otherwise a fine quest\nfor those whole like mapping mazes.\n21)  Angmar's treasury: also a great quest, also widely known (sigh), same\nsuggestions as Chaosdemon.\n22)  Ganja harvest:  solution is known, Herp's puzzle makes it a bit harder.\nI'd leave it as is or uprate the % a bit.\n23)  Help little girl: fairly unintuitive and many ways to go wrong.  Solution\nalso widely known.  Witch is a pain because she's always being killed for exp.\nSuggest that her exp be lowered to 400 or so to eliminate that.  Also, syntax\nis funny at times (polishing the iron key pops to mind)\n24)  Abduluh's heart: good quest, Denizen shouldn't be so hard for high-level\nplayers (howinhell is a 25th level figher supposed to kill a 50th level\nmonster unaided??).  Maybe make monster_level = 1.5 * playerlevel if level<10,\notherwise 1.2* level.  This is supposed to be an easy quest, remember...\n25)  Solar quest: not too bad, widely known solution.  Since it's worth so\nlittle, leave it as-is.\n26)  Padrone's castle: Also widely known, but a good beginner quest.  Leave\nas-is.\n27)  Cerberos: known MUD-wide, and dragon is too hard to kill for a quest\nworth this little.  Eliminate or change.\n28)  Save holy mission:  cute quest, but requires a lot of MUD-knowledge for\na quest of this level.  Put the translater in the newbie tree in chantilly's\ngarden or something.  Solution is also known MUD-wide.\n29)  Free man:  solution is not known mud-wide, and although the flow of\nthis quest is quite linear, the puzzles are somewhat challenging.  Raise the\n% for this one a bit.\n30)  Yorel: very odd syntax for start/end of quest, and rats can get to be\noverwhelming when there are lots of them.  Keep them from wimpying, make yorel\nmore responsive, keep quest % or raise it a bit.\n31)  Hobbe: good quest - yes, it's quite easy, but it will be one of the\nfirst quests anyone will do and it's a good intro to questing.  Leave as-is.\n32)  Newbie area:  leave as-is.  Good intro.\n33)  Orc slayer: eliminate.\n\nI've probably stepped on quite a few toes with the comments.  I mean noone\nany affront (please don't take it out on my little mortal body :).  These\nare just how I see the quests, based on my experience with them and talking\nwith other players.\n\n\nYours,\n  Cbr\n\n\n**\nI notice that the comunication on this board is pretty slow.\nFor example I would like to have some remarks on my note 10\nso I can work things out further or think on other solutions.\nThis way it's gonna take forever.\n\n                lovely Berenice\n\n\n**\nI changed Dmitri as the solution to the puzzle was too well known.\nI changed Troll Slayer to make the beginning more logical.\n\nMoonchild\n\n\n**\nGood! I'm changing my fairy area in an area where there is a quest and a area \nwhich don't has a quest. I only have to change a few rooms or monsters and I \nhave the quesst in.\n\nBerenice\n\n\n**\n  As things now stand, it is very hard to become a wizard on this MUD.\nConsider my case: dispite solving the hardest quest here, plus doing\nmost of the rest of them, I still need another 8% to reach the requisite\n80% figure.  That means I'll have to solve the Gnome King quest, and perhaps\none other as well.  IMHO, that is too much to ask.  I hear all the wizards\ncomplaining about quest info sharing between players, but then you present\nthose players with a scenario in which the only reasonable way to become\na wizard is to colloborate illegally with other players.  It should come\nas no surprise that they do so!\n\n  Part of the problem is that quests are being added at a furious rate.  While\nobviously wizards want to make themselves a quest and have players solve\nit, it places an undue burden on the players since each quest which is \nadded drops their quest % a certain amount; the harder the quest, the\ngreater the drop.  I have *barely* kept even at >70% over the past 6\nweeks, dispite solving Haunter and now Viking, not to mention going\nthrough the danger of completing the Vampire quest.  It is depressing\nto be working so hard while not making any real progress.\n\nTherefore\n\nSuggestion:\n  Change the quest system such that, for each new quest which gets added,\nthe quest % required to reach any given level goes down a corresponding\namount - that is, make it so that it takes the same level of quest-solving\nto reach any given level (including wizard) regardless of how many new\nquests are added.  This means that the %s will have to be altered each\ntime a quest is added, removed or revalued.\n\nNote that, while this will not hurt players when quests are added, it will\ndisadvantage those who have done a quest which is subsequently devalued\nor removed.  My suggestion in those cases is that those players not be\ninjured by the devaluation or removal of such a quest - they should be\ngiven credit (with a dummy quest, or whatever is appropriate) so that\ntheir % does not change as a result of the quest change.\n\nComments?  Reactions?  Flames?\nYour (currently) mortal friend,\n  Cbr\n\n\n**\nHi, short comment,\nThink the changes notified here are good ones, its a tiny start but we\nare at least moving now.\nAbout the suggestions of Cbr:\nI wanted to save my ideas and opinion a bit coz I wanna be on a sort of\noverseeing neutrally position for a while. Still I want already to say\nthat these points I though also at first but the problem is that this way\nit will become easier to wiz when more quests are added. Its obvious:\nThe % stays same but there is more choice which quests to do. So you can\nswitch quest more easily if you cant figure out this one there are more\nto choose from.\nWhat could be a solution? There are many, some already in my starting doc.\nHaving a maximum number of changes a month as example would allow players to\nwiz if he works hard for it. Another would be to drop the needed % each time\nbut not as much as Cbr suggests etc , there are more ways..\nWill post a more complete doc again later. See ya, keep brainstorming ;)\n\nGaladriel for Holy Mission.\n\n\n**\n  As Galadriel points out, my changes would make it somewhat easier to complete\nenough quests to wiz because players would have more choice in what\nquests they did - there would be more ways to fulfill the quest requirement.\nOn the other hand, this MUD is arguably very hard to wiz on right now -\nthere hasn't been a new wizard since (as I recall) late June or early July.\nMaking things somewhat easier would not be such a bad thing, IMO.\nAs things now stand, the system punishes people who don't have as much time\nto play (and thus get left behind in quest points) as well as those\nwho don't cheat.  I still think that keeping the quest requirements\nfixed with regards to new quests is a better system than what we currently\nhave.\n\n  My quest % has dropped again, too.  Now I'll need to do Gnome AND \nsome other quest to wiz, dispite being the only one to solve Haunter,\nthe first to do Viking, and having done all of the \"old\" quests except\nfor Elfcity.  *grumble*\n\nCbr\n\n\n**\nI have reduced %age for wiz to 75.\nWould arches please check when they approve quests that they are not a\nsteaming pile of horse manure, unlike some of the quests that have been\napproved in the last 6 months?\n\nMoonie\n\n\n**\n  We haven't had a note in almost 2 weeks, and I feel\nobligated to post one.  A few comments which I have picked up...\n1) Killing the denizen in Sarge's quest is outrageously hard for higher\n   level characters, since the denizen is automatically twice their \n   level.  Since this quest is supposed to be easy, I really think this \n   should be changed.  I've had a bunch of complaints (and at least one death\n  of a 27th level char) about him.\n2) With Moonchild gone, someone should take over his quests.  In particular,\n   Haunter virtually requires a player to be able to teleport in order\n   to finish in a timely fashion, and this places an (IMHO) undue burden\n   on non-mages.  With the loss of the usual teleport items (witch ball\n   and so forth), I think the quest should be modified to remove that \n   requirement.  I can discuss the exact change with whoever will be\n  modifying it.\n\nOn a personal note, I know a lot of you have been asking me to wiz.  \nBelieve me, I am considering it daily.  It is not at all an easy decision,\nand there are good arguments to be made on both sides of the issue.\n\nYours,\n  Cbr\n\n\n**\ndid all our brains stop storming?\nhas this board become obsolete?\nif its coz HM is temp closed, so be it.\nif its coz we are tired of improving HM, sad.\nbut if its coz we're just out of idea's, tell me coz then ill post\na summary of what we have now and then we can start doing things.\n\nGaladriel for Holy Mission.\n\n\n**\n\tWell It no longer exists in a loding sense. His area was Archived\nbecause the only reason a player went there was for the quest.\nSo I decided that it was a waste of obj loading to have it.\nSo thats one less quest to think about..\n\n\n\t\tWarlord\n\n\n**\n"
