tmp_text "Only be hit by the quest weapons...\nI like how you make that plural, meaning more than one cause\nlast time I saw, haunters only had one quest weapon which killed\nhaunters very easily...\nWhat else is getting changed on this mud since group parties arent\nallowed anymore...what, once a quest is done in the day, the quest\ndoesnt reset until reboot...???\n\nGumbo\n\n**\nHeh, you know real changes are never posted here, you find most of them when\nyour code bugs out and you have to read the inherited files to see what the\nfuck happened...\n\nMeech\n\n**\nThe quest was intended to have 2 quest eapons.  one for the real quest\nand one that worked somewhat also.\nbesides.  you can still hold the haunter and most players can take\nthe 3 hits that are needed to kill him with the quest weapon.\nWith the weapon the quest is MEANT to be solved by a single person.\n\nThere used to be a quest on here that did reset only over reboot.\nbut I think it was removed/fixed. not sure.  but this one was for\nthe good of players I think. In other words it should not hurt them. ;)\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\noki, we finished our language system ....\n\nwhat is it about:\nyou will now be able to speak in more than one language. at this time,\nthere are 2 languages in the game, common and nihonese. more will follow\n(e.g. every race will get his own language). this system is already used\nby the players and encourage you to put it into monster too.\nthis means: if you have a monster acutally \"saying\", \"telling\" or \"shouting\"\nsomething, you should use this system. functions are documented, just\ntype \"man lsay\", \"lshout\", \"ltell\" and \"lcatch_tell\". an example how it\nworks is in \"/players/patience/example/example_monst\". feel free to look at\nit and copy it over if you want. if you have any questions related to\nthis system, ask me. (if i ain't really busy, i will answer gladly. if i\ndo not reponse at once, keep on trying asking me, i will response as soon\nas possible).\n\ni learned, that samurais are able to speak nihonese too. so please talk\nto me how to install this system to your guild. i will help,\nof course. i am happy if you use this and enrich your guild and would\nnot consider this as stealing of my code or ideas (as i would nothing\nconsider so)\n\npatience\n\n**\nThe one thing I would like to see with the language system is that if you\ncan not speak the language then it should say something about a foreign\nlanguage or something, possibly even saying what the language is, instead\nof having the player speak and get a bunch of crap like -\nPlayer says: jrtehb 9htupmfhyv.\n\nConsidering that if this is suppose to be multi-cultured (that is, each race\nhas its own heritage and such), then everyone would have bits and pieces of\ndifferent languages.  And though one wouldn't understand it, one would be able\nto at least differentiate the language base, and therefore know that a certain\ntongue was such a language, instead of just ramblings.\n>>>>>Axlrose - ...<<<<<\n\n**\nabout the scrap on your screen:\n\nit will be handled in the near future the following way:\n\nif you do not understand the language at all, you will get scrap as\nyou get now.\n\nif you do understand the language (and be it only a bit) you will get\nscrap with bits of information. the better you understand the language\nthe more of the message will be not scrapped.\nexample: a player says: Hello Tatsuo, i like your guild very much !\nno chance to understand: sdlkf sdlkfsl, d sdflk lkdsf ... (scrap)\nfully understandable:   Hello Tatsuo, i like your guild very much !\npartly understood:      Helko Tadsuo, i like yokr guils very muxh !\n\nthat's why, you will get scrap. the reason, why you now get ONLY scrap\nis, that i have to finish the system. it is not that easy, i have\nto think of a proper algorithm (herp offered help in doing one in\nthe parser). but this will change soon and then the \"partly\nunderstand\" will make sense (and the scrap too)\n\nbtw: it works on other muds and is very much appreciated there. so i am\nsure, it is a good thing in this mud too. also there will be\nlanguages for all the races too and one extra for wizards (casting)\n\nhope, you now see my point of view\n\npat\n\n**\n\n\n Hi I was just asked to fix a bug by a player and don't have rights for that\n so bug is in room\n  /players/tamina/castle/rooms/alchemi\n  on line 109 where is command\n     p1 = CLO (\"/players/kasgaroth/poison/poison\");\n which sounds reasonable but that directory doesn't exist any more\n   so please change it to right poison path.\n    Thanks & Bye  Silver the Silver\n\n**\nFound now out what happened.\nThe poison path was moved to Krylls dir, since kryll is now\ngm of the guild :)\n\n             The bug is fixed now  Thankx again\n\n                           Whisky\n\n**\nPlease. There is a bug in pick_any_obj() in monster.c \nIf you want to see where exactly, clone /players/goldsun/nottingham/monster/soldier.c\nand drop an object. Soldier cannot pick it up at first time !\nBe more careful next time, if you change functions\n\nGoldsun.\n\nBy the way, add_poison() fuctions make me some problems too,\nsomeone changed variables in headline and i had to fix some monsters\n:(\n\n**\nuse /p/g/nottingham/monster/guard.c\n\n**\nThanks for info\n\n      Looks fixed now :   Whisky\n\n**\n\nI can understand what yuou are saying about some\nquests such as 'haunter of the dark' but i cannot\ncomprehend as to why. To my understanding the quest\nweapon to kill haunter would take as long as killing\nhim with a huge party - A player should not not be \npenalized for doing it that way if they wish - it\ntakes a lot more planning to complete a quest such\nas haunter with a group more so than by a singular player.\nIn addition to that, I cannot understand how certain\nwizards expect players to complete some of these new\nquests on there own that invole killing monsters that\ncan and could very eaily kill them in a few hits. If \nthe goal of quests has become promotion of singular \ncompletetion, then maybe you guys should re-examixe\nsome of these quests that you have installed, because\nI can rememeber what it was like to do some of the\nharder quests as a player - like wol, haunter, vampire,\nand orb! these quests involve killing several monsters \nthat on your own would take nearly two hours to complere\nack - complete one small aspect of a quest. just wanted to\ngive you quest questioners something to think about\nbefore you go changing them in one player a quest area!\n\nConcerned!\n\nApollo\n\n\n**\n\nThis note pertains to all guild masters who intend to\nchange the login of players in there guild to there\nguild rooms. I encountered a problem with Tatsuo's\nbabrbarian guild this morning - the problem was that\n/players/tatsuo/guild/room.c was bugged and when you\nhave players login to that room they also become bugged\nand cannot go anywhere. I like the idea of logging into\nguilds that  are hard to reach - however I do think you\nshould take a count of how many 'players' actually\nlike this idea - and they choose to log on from there\nguild you should create a backup code line that moves \nthem to /room/church.c so that they can do what is needed\nto either play or inform\nwho they have to! thank you and please check into what\nI said earilir about bugged login rooms other than /room/church.c\nthat are used as login points.\n\nApollo\n\n.\n\nwiz on\nwiz\n\nACK\n\n\n**\nThe original code was written for a single player to kill\nthe haunter. Groups can go after the giants, or a single\nplayer with a hold spell. The first person to do the quest\ndid it alone. As for the new quests.  Yes they are just being\nthrown out there, but such if the HM way. All gungho and\nlet the players debug it as they go along. Right now we are\nin a spiral that appears to need a crash landing the stop it.\nThis is the war of guild powers. One GM changes code and then\n2-5 others think tht was unfair so change thiers to be \"tougher\"\nand so on and so forth. Want to worry about un fair to player\nthen check out the legends system.  I am having appeals from\nmy guild NOT to put it in. They would rather have the fun\nof having a tough fight than to run around with 1500 HP\nand 1200 SP. Takes the fun out of it.  Guild wars are the\nwhat I believe to relaly be the out of control factor.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\n\ni do not disagree with new quests being added, I do\nhowever disagree as to wizard's methods of testing \ntheir respectice areas - especially quest areas. A\nnew quest should be gone over and finely tuned as to\nmake sure few if any bugs sneek through - ie. through\nsyntax, coding mistakes, and generally too tough.\nThere are more than enough players on here who seem \nto love to kill and the challenge that ensues. Why \nnot ask them to test out the area/quest and the\nrespective wizard snoops them. I think that many\nwizards are forgetting what is and what is not \npossible by a player on Holy Mission right now. One\ngripe that I do have is that you say Haunter of the\nDark was meant for one player - that may be true,\nhowever it is also true that not many knew how to\nmake the secret quest weapon that killed him in\n10 hits. One reason for this is the fact that I can\nremember that as a player it was bugged for the\nlongest time and no one could fix it, so a logical\nalternative to making it was to kill him in a large\ngroup. There appears to be so many monsters on this\ngame that are almost untouchable by one player, but\nin a group they are decent monsters to kill. Take\nHaunter, Dracula, Shao Kahn, Balor, and Kyoshi for\nexample ... each and everyone of those has a lot\nof HPS and for one player in todays standards could\nnot even nick. So what do they do, they create \nparties to kill them. Then as a result quest info.\nstarts, then cheating by players, etc etc. If\nwizards are set on making a quest singular in nature\nthen how about simply restricting the quest rooms\nwith a code line that allows one person in it at a \ntime. I can remember when a players biggest problem\nwas to find a way to gate other players into an\narea and it seems like no matter how much wizards\ntry to prevent it, another wizard sneaks his own\ncoding idea of how to get around it in. And yes,\ntherefore it is a repeating cycle that should stop.\nWill it stop? That is another question all by itself.\nWe were given test characters for a reason and yet\nsome wizards test a monsters strength on how many\n'zaps' it takes to kill it. A player does not have\n'zap' and so it should not be tested by it. \n\njust some kind words to think about ...\n\nApollo\n\n\n**\nwe changed the wimpy, that you now can wimp during multi-attacks too.\n\ni moved the whole stuff from the heart-beat of the player/monster to\nthe attack(). this means that you now must be more careful\nwhen overwriting or shadowing the attack().\n\nformat of attack() is: varargs int attack( object weapon, int hand )\n\nweapon is the weapon, with which you hit and hand is the hand,\nwhich you use for the attack\nreturn-code is 0, when there is no fight anymore and 1 if there is\nstill a fight !\nthe return-codes must be valid !!!!!!!!!!!\n\nso, if you have a monster which overwrites the attack() or if you shadow the attack(),\nplease make sure that the returnvalues are correct.\nif you call attack() more than once in the function, take care of what you\nget back of it. abort at once when the return-value is 0. cos this means,\nthat either the monster/player wimped or is dead.\n\nthis is no drastic change to the lib, it has been the same way before.\nonly a lot of you ignored that return-value.\n\noki, that all for now folks.\n\npat\n\n**\nHija\nThe there is the infravision needed for the mage_guild.\nAnd later sure for other purposes too.....\nIts important that all rooms are /room/room therefore, unless\nit can give light level bugs.\n\n         Please if you have some rooms not room/room ... recode them\n\n\n            Thankx in advance Whisky\n\n**\nchanges in the combatsystem:\n\n1. there is now a list of ppl/npcs, the npc hunts. at the moment the npc\n   hunts up to 5 objects.\n2. players do not hunt any longer\n3. alt_attacker_ob is no longer valid ! it remains in the lib until all\n   files using it are recoded. i will post a list of mobs still using it\n4. new functions:\n   object *get_hunted()    returns an array with the hunted objects\n   void add_hunted( obj ) tell the monster that there is a new one to hunt\n   void present_hunted(obj) is s.b. of my hunted list in my env\n   void empty_hunted()   removes all hunted objects\n   these functions are only valid at npcs\n\npat\n\n**\nJust would like all to know that Matt gave me permission to make a quest\nfor over level 20 characters. I have been coding it for a long time and\nwould be VERY angry if i were not allowed to intergrate it, I  am just\nmaking sure that everybody knows that I am making one so that no one will\ntell me that no more quests are allowed, also this quest is going to \nreplace moonchild's area, if anybody is upset at this i am sorry\nthe reason for me doing this is that the draconians are not properly coded,\nairborne is supporting my-recodning of the area. Hope I do not inconvenience\nanybody by my new area, and I hope it will be done soon,\ntake it easy, Tanthalas\n\n**\n\nI believe the dracs give an orb that solves the orb quest\nso be careful as to what you do with the area. it was made as\nan alterantive to doing it the long way even though\nthis is harder. as another question - what areas\nare you relacing???? surely not all of moonchilds areas - they\nare a trade mark for this game from when it started!!!\n\nApollo\n\n\n**\nSorry about the confusion about the last message I wrote. My area is only going to replace the dark_forest area of moonchild's area, the area with the draconians. As for the orb, I am not sure what is up, since when I tried to do the orb quest, the draconian leader was not in operation, if anyone would like to make sure that I do not ruin this part of the quest, feel free to tell me how that part of the quest is accomplished, since the draconianleader is no longer in moonchild's area to my knowledge and if he is, he is coded to be invisible. \nHope that answers your question, feel free to ask any more if you have them....\nTanthalas\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n"
