tmp_text "Hi there,\n    I remember we still have a unfinish match!\nBarbarian always kick fighter's butt....\nI hope the guild stay as it is now.....no guild bar, teleportation nor guild room. We are just a barbarian! Weapon, armors are useless. We fight with our might!\n Barbariabbarbarianbarbariabbarbarian!\n\n\n**\nI  hate to disagree with you  Darkchilde, but were not doing so hot  these\ndays. Maybe I'm  just a whiner, but when me friends in other guilds  are\ndoing massacres and pulps at 5th level with the mighty starburst,  and Im\nat 13th level  doing to very hards a round with the only weapon I can find\nsomething is a  little off. I dont want much, but a good weapon and a  place\nto heal  a little faster would be nice.  Even mages can wield the saber-tooth\n(AD+D would never allow that) and were stuck with a  battle axe or stone club\nI love this guild,  and I'll stand  by it  even if they take away all  me\npowers, but that wont stop me from pushing for improvements.  \n   Rinny Bellow!!!! *growl*     Still Upside down Rinny, barbarian  4  life.\n\n\n**\nSomeoneactuallycleanedourboard!I'llkeepthisshort,causemyspacebardoesntwork.\n\n\n**\nthis is about the devour command\nwhen i was on the vamp quest i devoured a roomful \nof corpses but i only went up a very small margin...\nthe other guilds are more capable of healing than the\nbarbs and i dont think its very fair if a lvl 25\nbarbarian cannot kill something in one round that\na mid level character can.  if our devour is better\nthat may change things.  keep me posted...\n**Valder**\n\n\n**\nIm back from my spring break...\n..if u need me just *bellow*    =)\n+Pace+\n\n\n**\nYeah! Pace is back!!\nMe was wondering where you were.\nMy spring break is coming up\nnext week.  Good to hear from you!\n**Valder**\n\n\n**\nI was in Geneseo last week... Anton brought me to see ya but you werent around.....although there was some guy crashed out in your room *cough*\n......laters Vald..     +Pace+\n\n\n**\nhey pace\nso i heard that you came by...i was hoping i'd get\na chance to meet you.  that was my roommate that was crashed\nout.  *grin*  well take care and i'll see you in\nthe mud world.  until next time!\n**Valder**\n\nValder puts on a pin that says, \"Pace for Barbarian Guild Master!\"\n\n\n**\n\tPACE FOR BARBARIAN GUILD MASTER!!!!!!!!\n\n\n**\nMe second the nomination of Pace for GM.\n     As if it even had to be said! :)    Rinny\n\n\n\n\n**\nDoes melee work ?\nNot for me it doesn't\n\n\n\n**\nIll third it.....\nyup, that pace.....hes so cool\nheh heh\nerm...+Pace+\n\n\n**\nWell Pace, your first assignment as GM nominee is to see why\nmelee has stopped working. It says you lose your blah blah blah, and\nthen the next round it says you return to your sanity, even though\nall the monsters are still in the room. Help us Oh great one!\n\n\n    Rinny\n\n\n**\nHello fellow brothers and sisters,\nthis is your friendly barbarian valder\njust telling you guys that i'm off to bigger\nand better things (spring break is finally here!!).\ntake care of yourselves and don't do anything\ni wouldn't do.  kick some butt and make me proud!!\nsee you guys in a week or two :)\n\t\t\t**Valder**\np.s. try to fix melee by the time i get back :)\n\n\n**\nI asked uglymouth to take a look at melee. I don't have access to fix it.\n=)\n+Pace+\n\n\n**\nAfter a long vaction in the vagabonds guild in which I gained a measely 1 level i have returned to my beloved barbarians\n(vagabonds suck under level 10) \nI still think this guild kicks ass ... pfbc ... er prepare for barbarian\ncombat is still as great as always \nMelee doesnt work ... you arent supposed to return to sanity until \nall the monsters are dead or you leave the room. I think it maybe \nbe because of a delay in the start of combat , or the call to stop melee\nis bugged or something. \ni was thinking about switching to mages, but now that I see this is \nstill a great guild I might stay, if melee is fixed that is. \nDarkchilde ... how come you havent wizzed yet !!! \nI dont think we need a bar or teleport, but it would be nice if some \nwizzes would code some weapons which barbarians could use. Or make \nit so that such weapons can be availiable in the store \nI have wanted to try one of the spears from the native warriors in\nPaces area, but I dont think I can kill one and when they are sold\nthey are always hidden away. \nPace how about Putting some heavy wooden clubs... of the orc kinds on the orang-utans ? \nIn anycase ... we cant use weapons in barb combat or melee .. so we dont \nneed one all the time. \n \n*   *  * ** VEGA ** *  *   * \n \nPS : I think Pacew would be an AWESOME GuildMaster, His area totally \nfits with the theme of our guild!!!! \nI just had a great Idea .... attach another area to this end of orc valley ! a barbarian theme area! of coarse anyone can play \nit but it would be special for us because it is close to our guild. \ni think it would be cool haveing players do the same mad dash through\norc valley that we do all the time. Plus it would attract players to this \narea , and more people would join our guild! \n\n\n**\nHi....Sorry to give out on you guys...but well, it's time for me to move\non. I'am done with coding on here, so I will just be getting on to socialise\nnow and again. I'am not going to banish myself, so I can still come back\nif I ever feel like it. Iam very busy on another mud at the moment, on\nwhich I'am a trainee Arch-wiz =). Ive already done much more work on there\nthan I have in the year Ive been wiz here. It's an awesome mud, and it deserves\nmore of my time....\nif any of you ever want to check it out..\nwarns.et.tudelft.nl 5317\n...you will see many familiar faces there....\nThanks for makin my time here fun....stay cool!\n\n      +Pace+\n\np.s Don't give up on the guild!\n\n\n**\n  WHAT'S UP???? MELEES BEEN DOWN FOR SEVERAL WEEKS!!!\n  WE ONLY HAVE TWO SPECIAL ATTACKS AND MELEE IS VERY VALUABLE\n  TO BARBARIANS!!!!!!  PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP.\n  **VALDER**\n\n\n\n**\nAs far as i am aware it is being looked at now by uglymouth\nand galadriel. I dont know when it will be fixed so please be patient\nand things will be ok.\nsorry valder......thats all i know :)\n\ntexas\n\n\n**\nthanks a lot for looking into that Texas.\nThe idea of putting a barbarian theme area around\nhere sounds really cool too.  too bad we dont have\na gm though :(  thanks again Texas :)\n**Valder**\n\n\n**\nHi all,\n\nI think I have fixed the melee.\nIf there still occur any probs,\nleave a note here, or mail me.\nSee you around,\n\n\t\t\tViking Lord Uglymouth\n\n\n**\n Thank you very much for fixing melee.\n I appreciate it, especially because we only\n have 2 special attacks and each is so precious.\n -Warlord Valder-\n\n\n**\nAny o you barbs round for the summer? Just wonderin.\n                    Rinny.\n\n\n**\nHi,\n\nAfter a long time of leaderlessness, you have a guildmaster\nagain: Airborne will take care of the guild from now on.\n\n\t\t\tViking Lord Uglymouth\n\n\n**\n    Hooray, for Airborne ! :) Now I can complain to him instead of\nUglymouth ! :)\n    But it IS nice to have a GM. I hope we with less complaints now, but\nI doubt it :)\n\n                Goodluck Airborne.\n\n                      Luvs & Hugs,\n                                    Nipples.\n\n\n**\nTo all my Barbarians:\n\nI want you all to get together and come up with a good time that we \ncan all meet. You will find the time for the meeting as best you can\nand then you will pick your tribal leader at that campfire. I need\nto meet with you all and get some ideas as to what I have gotten\nmyself into.. and you all need to meet me as well.\n\nI will not get on your case after this point... you wanted someone to\ncare for your guild... and you have it... now its time for you guys\n(and gals) to put something into the organization of your own guild.\n\nLeave a note when you have selected a time to meet.\n\nLord Airborne the Wild!\n\n\n**\nguess there is no hoard to call...\n*sigh*\n\nsad about that\n\nkryll, simple yet fierce\n\n\n**\nHeya airborne.
