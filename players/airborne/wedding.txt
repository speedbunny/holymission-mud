The blind captain is still willing to prefrom the wedding cerimony, 
provided he is will compensated for his time.  Usually 10,000 coins
is enough.. but this can rise or fall at any time.

Because he is blind, the captain is unable to tell the sex, levels, and 
religious followings of the bride or groom.  

To start the cerimony type 'marry <first_player> and <second_player>'.
A wizard is not necessary for this to occur.  For a list of all weddings
on Holy Mission type "weddinglist".
