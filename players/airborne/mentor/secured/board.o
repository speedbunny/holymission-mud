tmp_text "if nottingham is going to be part of your area\nand your a wiz already, why you getting your mentor\nor someone to install it..do it yourself if\nits part of your area????\n\nGambit\n\n\n**\nI do not know the status of Airborne,\nAll I know is he is retired, I assume due to lack of time.\nSO:\nI again offer my services for Area Approval.\nAnd again stress the idea of making it into a Comittee,\ninstead of only one wiz.\n\nShogun Exos\n\n\n**\nIt used to be a committee of hmm ....\nAirborne, Warlord, Avatar, .. can't recall the others.\n\n\n**\nI am coding a new area.\nBased on faeries (no not 1 hit kills either).\nMy sister Tofu is writing the room descs, I am doing all the coding.\n\nShould  be ready by January 15th.\n\nExos\n\n\n**\nI have checked over Topaz area. It has been ready for quite some time.\nAs Meecham also expressed that the area was ready.\nI recommend that this area be installed after review by\nour friendly AAC, and that Topaz be promoted to 33.\nThe area includes a simple, low level quest.  Most of the new quests have\nbeen on the upper level end.  All information can be found in \nthe capitalized AREA.DOC files in topaz dir, including room connections.\n\nHis castle already contains the quest.\n\nTatsuo\n\n\n**\n\nthe title says it all\n\nThe Mighty Kryll\n\n**\nOur wonderful wizard Seducer has completed and refined a wonderfully\nentertaining area. With a quest to be added later.\n\nThe are is a vast swamp with some interesting movement qualities\nYou must test various rocks for stability, then jump to that rock.\nPick the wrong rock and you go splash, DT, moved to church.\n\nThe area will be connected west of alian's area.\nat players/alian/ forest5.c  to the west.\n\n**\nI forgot to say that i checked it over, Pulled an Airborne and had\nhim recode 100 rooms. then approved it. *grin*\n\nTats\nTOPAZ AREA NOT CHECKED YET, *BOGGLE*\n\n**\nI have been asked to check over Gareth's area.\nWill be done Friday night my time.\n\n**\nthis place is useless...\nthe list is NEVER updated\n\nThe Mighty Kryll\n\n**\n\nPlease look at /players/apollo/Wizard.List\n\nThis is an updated list of every immortal\ncurrectly at level 30 or above - I am still trying\nto track down a good majority of Apprentices. So\nif every wizard that has a mentee of a wizard that has\na mentor please mail me so I can continually keep updating\nthe file for everyone conveince.\n\nThank you\n\nApollo\n\n\n**\nSince Pace has been banished shouldn't they be assigned new mentors?\n\nDazza\n\n**\n\nYes they should \n\n\n**\nWIll mentor Smith when she wizzes...\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n"
