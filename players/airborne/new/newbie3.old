"     The first things you need to know are the communication commands. They are: say, tell, and shout. Say is used to speak to everyone in the same room, tell is used to speak to a particular person regardless of where they are in the MUD, and shout is used to speak to everyone on the MUD at the same time. Shout and tell will use up spell points, which we will discuss later on.\n"+
"     Say takes on the following format, say <message>. Or you can use ' before a message to have the same effect. For example, say Hello. is the same as 'Hello. Both will yield the following; You say : Hello.\n"+
"     Shout works in pretty much the same way as say, you type shout followed by the message. You will have to shout Holy Mission is the greatest MUD to go on to the next lesson.\n"+
"     Tell works a little differently. Because you are speaking to one person, you have to distinguish who that person is. The command for tell is: tell <name> <message>. That is the word tell followed by the person you wish to give a message to followed by the message.\n" +
