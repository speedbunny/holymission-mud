Some of my original idea files seem to have got lost.
I'll try to compensate for them and write up what I remember:

- The guild is divided into four Trade Houses, which are each
other's rivals up to a certain point. Each house has its
specialty trade goods, rules and things.
- Each house is ruled by one or more merchant princes, called
Lord (or Lady) Treasurer. If there are more, together they form
the Trust. The Trust has several responsibilities:
* decide on promotions of guild members
* decide on specialty trade goods
* determine interest levels
* assign missions
* ...
- Several trade agencies will be established throughout the mud.
Each agency belongs to a house. The amount of players trading
there, partly determines the status of a House. Agencies have
to be maintained by player agents. That is to say that it may
be an npc run shop, but there will be several things the agent
must to in order to keep it running.
- Within a house, players will be able to get things cheaply.
This will be compensated by high membership fees and taxes.
- There will be a possibility to make special parties to form
a caravan. These could make a long trip along the agencies to
get most profit of their collected things.
- I had an idea of having Houses offer a 'Special Delivery'
service. If a player pays for one of these, a guild member is
assigned the task to make the delivery, no matter where. Of
course the House with the best records will gain most status.

I think these were the major points. If I think of more, it
will be added later, with proper date marks.
