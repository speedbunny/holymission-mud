We, Merchants, are people that are specialized in trade and transport.
Trade is our blood and we know to turn every stone into a lump
of gold, without the faintest use of magic. Transport is our heart,
for we know that prices will be higher in far away places and 
wealthy persons pay good if their goods are delivered safely.
Thiefs are our mortal enemies: they undermine the free market. Avoid
contact with them as much as possible. Merchants do not like to fight,
for it only means risk of damaging goods and always causes delay. Thus
if we must fight, we'll hold nothing back, in order to finish it as
quickly as possible, not shunning to use money as our weapon.

soul = money purse, which can carry as many coins as the player can.
