  * cake<1-4>.c    food       The wedding cakes.
  * creampie.c     food       Can be eaten or thrown into someone's face.

The idea:
      To give a little more colour to the weddings in the Holy Mission.
   These cakes are very detailed, in look, smell and eat commands.
   Players can design the cakes themselves, to make it a real personal
   present to the wedded couple. For each storey there's a choice of
   four different designs and for different materials (tastes). 
   It is NOT possible to put your own messages in it (just don't take
   the risk of possibly offensive things).
      Each part that can be eaten heals 30 sp but heals only 5 hp 
   (==strength). This is done to allow players to shout (30 sp each)
   the best wishes (as they favour that so much) and allow even level 1
   players to eat a part of the cake.
      Of course this is not just another normal heal that just happens
   to look very nicely. It can only be used on the day of the wedding.
   Besides, nobody can eat of it before the bride and groom have had 
   their respective parts of the cake.
      If there are cakes, there are cakefights. We wizzes have proved
   that ourselves (if you're in for an amusing time, read cakewars.txt in 
   this directory). But since I don't want the wedding cakes to be abused  
   for fights, I made a nice creamy pie and an imp under the counter, who
   sells them.

Details of the cakes:
 cakenr   storeys   parts (per storey)   cost (per part)
   1        2        10 (8+2)             3000 (300)
   2        3        16 (8+6+2)           5000 (312)
   3        4        20 (8+6+4+2)         7000 (350)
   4        5        30 (10+8+6+4+2)     10000 (333)

Debugging note:
   If a player has problems ordering a cake, make sure that there is
   no cake in Candy (if there is, I then normally someone is busy ordering
   one. It shouldn't occur, but stranger things happen).
   If it's still buggy after that (I pray not), mail me.
