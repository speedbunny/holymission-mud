[27]   The Very Suicidal Tatsuo the Human Ninja is absolutly sick of everybody
       asking him for quest information, and also thinks that Saffron should
       keep the death toll down to about 4 a day, (ever notice she dies in
       pairs), i'm also sick of people smiling happy at me every time they
       enter the room, the next person to smile happy at me is going to eat a
       katana and a dozen fireshurikens unless of course the Ancient Yellow
       Orangutaun pleads with me not to behead them, but he is only on the mud
       on Tuesday's so that would be a good day to smile happy at me, I really
       do love long titles, keeps people happy when they read the who list, if
       anybody needs a wakizashi just ask.
