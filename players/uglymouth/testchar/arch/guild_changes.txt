Here follow some thoughts on what to do with the guilds when we switch to the
skill system. My reasons for this doc are the following:
- only very few guilds are in the hands of their creators.
  (Guild:creator/guildmaster --->
   Thief:	Herp		/Herp
   [Druid:	Wolfi		/Meecham]
   Fighter:	Capablanca	/Portil
   Jedi:	Kelly		/Mangla
   Mage:	Llort		/Llort
   Bard:	Cashimor	/Qwerty
   Monk:	Whisky		/Warlord
   Ninja:	Patience	/Dice
   Summoner:	Matt		/Matt
   Vagabond:	Colossus	/Colossus
   Barbarian:   Moonchild	/-		)
  This leaves only 4 of our 11 guilds in the hands of their creators.
- A lot of changes have taken place by the hands of succeeding GMs. In some
  cases this has changed/will change (plans I've read about) the colour of
  the guild substantially.
- By changing to the skill system we will need GMs that are expert coders.
  The guilds will need to be recoded completely anyway.

Now I can just feel that I will get many questions from GMs about:
'Can I change this?', 'I'd like to build that for my guild', 'Can I change
my guild to such a guild', etc. So I'd like to see some decisions made about
this matter.
