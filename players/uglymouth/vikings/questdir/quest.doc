Quest name: Viking Quest

Description:
   In a tropical bay, somewhere south-west in this world, a clan of vikings
   has invaded and conquered a coastal village, called Symria. The vikings
   have proven to be quite stubborn in negotiations, and are now planning to
   settle in the village and its surrounding area.
   With our diplomats sent back in only their underwear and our armies needed
   elsewhere, we need a witty adventurer to get the vikings to leave the area.
   Good luck,
                              
                              Viking Lord Uglymouth.

   Note: It is possible to solve this quest without fighting. However, if
   you get into one, prepare to lose some hp...
   
   This quest is: moderate.


Steps to solve the quest:
1 - Make the geiser at the underground lake under the waterfall (hint is in
    the song of the mermaid on the rock) explode. This causes a waterspout 
    from the well in the village of Symria, extinguishing the fire in the 
    village. The village eldest, if found, will give the player the village 
    medallion and the request to be their champion in the battle against 
    the vikings.

2 - The vikings actually conquered exactly this place because it used to be
    the place where one of their heros was burried somewhere and it's said to
    be a place that brings good luck (chief in big tent holds this info). The
    old grave is actually a burrow that over the years has become the highest
    dunehill. Signs can be found on the megalithes, lying beneath the sands, 
    in the rooms surrounding the hill. The old grave can be entered through 
    a tunnel under one of the stones. In the grave are: the hints needed at 
    the oak, the hero's ghost, treasure, and of course a small trap.

3 - With the medallion and a hint from a clay tablet on the corpse of the
    village priest, the player can reach the holy oak in the infinite jungle.
    The 'sleep' command only works if certain conditions are met.
    Details: wear full viking garments (tunic, helm and axe), offer a piece 
    of rabbit meat (snare it at open place in the dunes). Hints on what to 
    do can be found in the old grave.

4 - In his/her dream Sleipnir, Odin's horse, arrives and takes the player to 
    Walhalla, where he/she meets the viking gods Odin, Thor and Loki. They 
    say that the vikings cannot be beaten because they hold their favour (a 
    thing that the player should have found out by other means too by now). 
    However, they like the player's guts and will help him/her... if a 
    problem is solved. Details: problem = Get Mjolnir, Thor's hammer, which 
    is as big as a century old oak tree, moved. Make Loki angry enough that 
    he smashes the hammer at the player, thus solving the problem. To this
    end Loki needs to be teased in 6 different ways. Then the player ends up 
    at the top of the waterfall. This gives the player the chance to call 
    Odin's raven once and only once (so wrong use doesn't serve any purpose).

5 - Get to the viking's dragonship and tell the first mate the command 
    to sail home. This can be found by the raven or by deciphering runes.
    At the viking's homeland the player must give the village medallion to
    Hagar, High Lord of the Vikings as a token of conquered land. This will
    get the player accepted as a full member of the viking clan and ends the
    quest. To get home, teleport back, or drink some 'supermead' *grin*.

                                                                   
Connection to the mud:                                            
   - The main area is situated south of the village shore, like this:
      /players/uglymouth/vikings/shore1.c exit 'north' connects with
      /vill/shore.c exit 'south'.
   - The vikings' homeland could be connected somewhere in the furure on 
     the very northern part of the mud (north of Mts. of madness, or so). 
     If this is done, it should then be accessible from the south or at 
     least give an exit southwards to get back, although this should be a 
     very hard way to walk (reason: I don't really like a piece of land that 
     actually lies nowhere specific). This area might be expanded later on.
