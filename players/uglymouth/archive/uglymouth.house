The mounted guard of honour rides\nout and posts itself in two rows, between which you can enter\nthe castle proper. At the horizon you can still see a dark spot,\nthat must be the tower of the village church.\n","This is a pleasant courtyard. A crossroads of gravel paths leads from\nthe central well. In the corners of the yard small gardens have been\nplanted. South from here lies the gatehouse and to the west leads a\ndoor to the keep. From the east the smell of well roasted meat comes\nblowing in the soft breeze. North, a horse studies you amusedly.\n","You have arrived at the stables of the castle. This area has been\ndivided into ten boxes, that can each house a horse comfortably.\nSince the guard of honour rode out, eight boxes are empty. From\nthe nineth box, a big, white warhorse looks amusedly at you. The\nlast box has been converted into some kind of saddle chambre.\n","The smell of the oxen roasting over the fire makes you wish it was\nalready time for dinner. Several tables and cupboards line the walls\nof this room, filled with little pots and boxes. The fireplace and\nthe oven next to it dominate the south wall. To the north you can\nenter the servants' quarters. West lies the courtyard.\n","This is the Knights' Hall of the castle. It is a big room with long\ntables in the centre. At the west end stands the high table, where\nLord Uglymouth is seated himself, when he's around. Two big chandeliers\ngive a pleasant bright light to the hall. Through the east door you\narrive at the courtyard. North and west lie Uglymouth's private rooms.\n","This room is mostly occupied by unmade beds and clothes lingering all\nover the place. As you look carefully you see a small boy sleeping in\none of the smaller beds. A washing bowl stands in the corner, several\nhalf-dried towels hanging next to it. Obviously the less important\ninhabitants of this castle have their quarters here.\n","This is Uglymouth's private office. A large oaken desk is standing\nin the centre of the room, with a comfortable leather chair behind\nand two wooden chairs before it. The floor is covered with a thick\npersian carpet. A single window lets the daylight come through.\nA shelf on east wall is filled with big leatherbound books.\n","From the enormous bed you conclude that this is the Lord's bedroom.\nThe bed is big and soft and carved with many details of heroism.\nAn marble washing basin is build in the south wall, and a heavy\nwardrobe stands against the west wall. You sink up to your ankles\nin a thick, warm carpet. A small door leads to a room north.\n","These are Lord Uglymouth's private quarters. He comes here when he wants to\nsit and think in quiet, apart from the busy life in the rest of the world.\nThis room is very sparsely decorated. I simple field bed stands in one\ncorner, and a small wooden table against the wall. A big candle stands in\nthe centre of the room, providing a little light. For the rest it's empty.\n",0,})
