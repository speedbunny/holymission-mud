So here are a few descriptions for races. I've stuck to a general description
that should help players in preparing for roleplaying their race. I have made
use of some generally accepted concepts for certain races, but sometimes I
have deliberately put some changes into it. For guilds I have kept to the
list you provided for me the other day. You can ignore skill remarks.
Read through it, and use whatever you like.

HUMANS
======
Background:
Since all of us have been humans in the life we just let behind, we all
know that humans take themselves as the standard with which everything
else is compared. From a point of view of the other races, humans are
fairly tall, slim and poke their noses in just about anybody's business.
Humans are quick to learn and easily pick up bits of knowledge of every
subject they set themselves to deal with. However, humans also know that
for every bit they learn in a different field, there will be someone in
another race who will add an equal amount of knowledge to lift his trade
to a height that no human ever may reach. To compensate for this, humans
are a very social people, and their combined powers are equalled by none.

ELVES
=====
Elves seem a noble race in the eyes of all other races, and are either
highly respected or deeply hated for it. Elves are sometimes described
as creatures of the sun, for their golden blonde hair, their fair
complexion and soft but stimulating voices. Others name elves the children
of the moon, for they come and go in silence, and their presence can
lead people to safety or to a certain death. Outsiders seldom can tell
whether it's their magic or skills they apply. Their longevity is the cause
that much of the ancient wisdom has been preserved in their clans, where it
is guarded against outsiders with anything less than a heart as pure as
freshly fallen snow.

Length: slightly varying around 5 foot
Weight: 50 to 60 kg

Guilds often joined: ranger, jedi, ninja, bard, druid, healer, any mage

DWARVES
=======
Dwarves are often seen as the silent guardians of morality. There presence
usually makes people watch their words, for one can never tell what's on a
dwarf's mind. Although dwarves often have a short temper where it concerns
bad jokes and impolite behaviour, they show an almost infinite patience
when it comes to completing a task they have set themselves. Although rumours
go that dwarves can get real drunk on parties, they will be polite at all
times when dealing with the other races. Dwarven hospitality is often
mistaken for unfriendliness, because dwarves treat their guests the same
as they treat their own: sharing the bits the harsh environment they came 
from allows them to have. Their love for their families is renowned.

Hard Facts:
Length: 4 to 5 foot
Weight: 60 to 80 kg

Infravision: well developed
Skill costs: low for any skills in their class, medium for mastery in one,
  high for other masteries
Guilds often joined: any warrior, cleric, crusader, vagabond, alchemist

HOBBITS
=======
Hobbits tend to get treated as if they are little children because of their
heights. And many are the people who have found out the hard way that this
was a BIG mistake. For if you are a 'tall person', as the hobbits call many
of the other races, don't forget at what height a hobbit's eyes are when he
gets angry. But hobbits are hard to get angered, and quick to forget. Life
is too full of joyful things, so let's enjoy all of it while you can! To
hobbits a good friend is worth the world and more. And a friend's need, a
good story or an intricate puzzle are the only things a hobbit will really
put himself into trouble for. And it surprises often the wisest in what way
hobbits manage to get themselves and their friends out of it again.

Hard Facts:
Length: 3 to 4 foot
Weight: 40 to 50 kg
Look: Skin from pale to dark tanned, any kind of brown hair and eyes.

Infravision: somewhat developed
Skill costs: Low on any initial skill, medium on any expert, high on mastery
Guilds often joined: ranger, jedi, thief, pirate, bard, druid, healer,
  sorceror, vagabond, summoner

GNOMES
======
Gnomes are a race which is a distant relative from dwarves. Gnomes are very 
solitary people. They are nevertheless very interested in anything anyone
has to tell or show. Not so much because they want to get to know the person,
but either to satisfy they infinite curiousity or to find ways to obtain
things that noone else has. Gnomes are very fond of novelties, and will go
to great lengths to find out every detail of a puzzle. This often results
in the creation of new things or views. But beware when gnomes start fiddling
with the one power humanoidkind was not meant to understand: magic.

Hard Facts:
Length: 4 to 5 foot
Weight: 60 to 80 kg
Look: Greyish pink to dark tanned skin, grey or black eyes, with white or
blond hair. Gnomes have big ears and often wear some kind of hat to disguise
that fact. 
Infravision: well developed
Skill costs: low for any skills in their class, medium for mastery in one,
  high for other masteries
Guilds often joined: warrior, paladin, jedi, any rogue, healer, elementalist,
  alchemist

HALF-ELVES
==========
Half-elves are the result of the occasional amourous affair between humans
and elves. Although they have inherited the diversity of humans, and the
magic capabilities and appearance of elves, they are not truely accepted by 
either race. They are too restless to fit in the elven family traditions and 
are too much a magic creature to fit into the human urban society. This makes 
the half-elves very solitary people, but they are happy that way. Half-elves
get along with all the other races and often form a bridge when racial
friction becomes high. Because they are used to their solitude, they only
tend to do things they like, when they like it, even if others are present.

Hard Facts:
Length: 5 to 6 foot
Weight: 50 to 70 kg
Look: As elves, with skin, eye and hair colours that don't exist in elves.
Infravision: fairly well developed
Skill costs: low for any skills, medium for one mastery, high for any other
Guilds often joined: any, except pirate or monk (not solitary professions)

ORCS
====
Although orcs and their kin are often regarded as an ugly race, they are
actually the closed to humans of any of the 'dark' races. Orcs are easy
to anger but easy to please as well. Although they are very touchy when it
comes to criticism, this is usually because they regard their honour and
bravery as the most highy valued traits. Orcs are very social people, but
their very open social values are not always appreciated by the other races.
Orcs usually go for the direct, but honest approach in everything they do.

Hard Facts:
Length: 5 to 7 foot
Weight: 60 to 100 kg
Look: Skin from dark tanned to dark brown or dark red, black eyes, bright
white, red, dark brown or black hair. Orcs have very flat noses and prolonged
corner teeth in their lower jaw, looking like tusks.
Infravision: fairly well developed
Skill costs: low for any low skills, high for any mental or magical skill
Guilds often joined: any fighter, except paladin, any rogue, except bard,
  cleric, crusader, elementalist, summoner

HALF-ORCS
=========
Half-orcs are the odd offspring of a relationship between an orc and a human
or half-elf. They face the same problems as do the half-elves, and are also
very solitary people. Half-orcs however, often tend to be more chaotic in
their ways as compared with half-elves. In company they are often the ones
who start the action. While alone, they usually spend a lot of time on the
one thing they have made their passion (which can be sensible or insensible
thing). Half-orcs are known to simply drop a job when they get bored with it.

Hard Facts:
Length: 6 to 7 foot
Weight: 60 to 80 kg
Look: as humans, but with mismatching hair, skin and eye colours. Some of 
them have the orcish 'tusks'.
Infravision: none
Skill costs: low for any low skills, high for any mastery
Guilds often joined: any

OGRES
=====
Of the humanoid races ogres are the one who closest relate to the giants.
They have their slow, massive ways of moving and thinking in common. They
are not very very sensitive to what other people might take offence to and
their bulky mass makes that they often get away with it as well. Ogre
society is a matriarchal one and women of any race are usually treated with
fear and respect. Although ogres are bright enough to understand any ideas
put to them, they usually don't bother with mental exercise if their brute
physique can get the job done as easily. Ogre's don't practice magic a lot,
not because they can't (they can!), but simply because they can't be bothered
with all the learning that comes with it.

Hard Facts:
Length: 7 to 8 foot
Weight: 90 to 120 kg
Look: Skin from pale through yellow to dark brown, eyes red or brown, black
hair. They have massive muscles and too long arms. They lack eye lids.
Infravision: slightly developed
Skill costs: low for any physical skills, high for any mental/magical
Guilds often joined: any fighter, any thief, crusader

HALF-OGRES
==========
Half-ogres probably originated as the children of human women who were
raped by ogres. When their numbers began to increase, they started to
flock together and formed their own communities. Since they have always had
close ties to their mothers and their ogre heritage lead to the fact that
half-ogres too have a matriarchal society. In particular women of old age
are honoured as demi-goddesses. Half-ogres are very closed towards the
other races. They know they have the brutal attitude of the ogres, but
would like to be more subtle like their human relatives. This hitting-and-
making-up way of life can only understood by other half-ogres.

Hard Facts:
Length: 6 to 7 foot
Weight: 70 to 90 kg
Look: As tall, strong built humans, or as puny ogres.
Infravision: none
Skill costs: low for any physical skills, mediocre for low mental skills,
  high for all other
Guilds often joined: any non-mage

TROLLS

SEKREH

FAERIES/WEE FOLK
================
Faeries are a race that is rumoured to have its origin in magic itself.
This may explain their whimsical nature. Anything can make a faerie happy,
sad, angry or curious, without a possibility to know which reaction you 
will trigger. In general faeries are very playful and very curious to new
or obscure things. They're not so much interested in the power of magic, as
in new ways to apply this power. In particular on other people. Although
faeries like to live in company, the only real important person is he.

Hard Facts:
Length: 3 to 5 foot
Look: Any skin, eye and hair colour are present, as the faeries can change
this at will. Dress is equally diverse. No wings!
Weight: 30 to 60 kg
Infravision: none
Skill costs: low for any mental/magical skills, high for any physical
Guilds often joined: any priest, except crusader, any mage

RAKASTA
=======
These catlike people are very agile. They live in social groups which are
formed by mutual agreement, much like humans. Although to outsiders these
groups may look like total anarchy, there always is a definite leader, whose
final decisions are never questioned. Rakasta are very proud of who they are
as an individual, and will do anything to make them look different from
other rakasta. These radical differences can only be allowed because the
rakasta adhere to a very strict set of social rules and there is little
interaction that does not involve one protocol or another.

Hard Facts:
Length: 5 to 6 foot
Weight: 50 to 60 kg
Look: Any kind of fur and eyes colurs that we know from our cats (including 
cheetahs, tigers, etc.). They always dress in bright coloured clothes.
Infravision: fairly well developed
Skill costs: mediocre for any skill, low for one master, high for others
Guilds often joined: warrior, barbarian, paladin, any rogue, cleric,
  healer, monk, sorceror, vagabond, alchemist

SKAVEN
======
These ratlike people are looked at with disgust by most of the other races,
and the rakasta in particular. Skaven live in small gangs. In this formation
they try to survive in any way they can. Property is not a known concept
for skaven, which does not help in their acceptance by other races. Skaven
don't care much for clothing either and, dressed in their ragged cloaks, all
skaven look the same to outsiders. Skaven proudly carry their use-names,
which they gain from their gang members for a special feat or trait.

Length: slightly varying around 4 foot
Weight: 40 to 50 kg
Look: Brown or grey fur, black eyes, with th occasional albino.
Infravision: fairly well developed
Skill costs: mediocre for any skill
Guilds often joined: any that do not pursue a fixed goal
