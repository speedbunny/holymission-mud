The recoding of: Sherman's Area and Vampire Quest

General description of changes:
- Redone layout of the area
- Improved descriptions A LOT
- Improved consistency (i.e. made it an all undead area -> removed demons)
- Added a story to the quest
- Made things more interactive
- Upgraded to current coding standards

Features:
- Killed vampires regenerate in their coffins and return to the tower again
- When loosing during combat vampires transform via wolf to bat form to
    gain in armour class at the cost of weapon class
- Major vampires are personified and have their own graves
- Retired vampire hunter for hints (interactive and costly!)
- Randomized coffin locations for vamire count (no longer king ;-).
