EFUN: pointerp

SYNTAX:
int pointerp( mixed arg );
  mixed arg;

DESCRIPTION:
Pointerp is used to determine whether arg is an array.
C-coders: don't be confused by the name of this function. Regardless
of any other pointers, pointerp really only returns 1 for arrays.

RETURN VALUE:
If 'arg' is an array it returns 1, and 0 if this is not the case.

SEE ALSO:
intp
stringp
objectp
mappingp
floatp

EXAMPLE:
string *word_list;
int i;

word_list = ({ "I", "love", "LPC", "because", "it's", "fun" });
i =  pointerp( word_list );
// i is now 1.
i = pointerp( i );
// i is now 0.
