EFUN: allocate

SYNTAX:
mixed *allocate( size );
  int size;

DESCRIPTION:
This allocates memory for an array of 'size' elements.
The number of elements must be >= 0 and not bigger than a system
maximum (usually 1000). Note that allocate does allow changes in
the size of the array at a later time. This method is most efficient
for the declaration of large arrays.

SEE ALSO:
sizeof

EXAMPLE:
int *num_list;

num_list = allocate( 4 );
// num_list is now an array of ({ 0, 0, 0, 0 }).
