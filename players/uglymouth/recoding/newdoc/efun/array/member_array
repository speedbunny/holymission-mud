EFUN: member_array

SYNTAX:
int member_array( elem, arg );
  mixed elem;
  mixed *arg | string arg;

DESCRIPTION:
Member_array searches for the presence of element 'elem' in array 'arg'.
If 'arr' is of type string, it checks whether 'elem' is character (to be
given between single quotes, or as its number as defined in the standard
ASCII table) of 'arg'.

RETURN VALUES:
If 'elem' is not a member of 'arr' the efun returns -1.
Otherwise the index number the element in the array is returned.

SEE ALSO:
member

EXAMPLE:
string *str;
int i;

str = ({ "a", "b", "c", "d", "e" });
i = member_array( str, "b" );
// i is now 1, because str[1] == "b".
