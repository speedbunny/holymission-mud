EFUN: mkmapping

SYNTAX:
mapping mkmapping( mixed *arr1, mixed *arr2 );
  mixed *arr1;
  mixed *arr2;

DESCRIPTION:
This efun creates a mapping from two arrays. It takes array 'arr1' and
and defines its elements as the indices of the mapping. The elements of
array 'arr2' become the corresponding values of the mapping. The arrays
are matched in order, so arr1[0] will index arr2[0], arr1[1] will index
arr2[1], etc. If the arrays are of unequal size, the mapping will only
contain as much elements as are in the smallest array.

RETURN VALUE:
The mapping created from the two arrays is returned.

EXAMPLE:
string *abc;
int num_list;
mapping mp;

abc = ({ "a", "b", "c", "d", "e" });
num_list = ({ 1, 2, 3, 4 });
mp = mkmapping( abc, num_list );
// mp is now ([ "a":1, "b":2, "c":3, "d":4 ]).
