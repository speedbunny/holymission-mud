EFUN: tan

SYNTAX:
float tan( x );
  float x;

DESCRIPTION:
Calculates the tangent of x. X must be given in radials
(360 degrees = 2 * pi radials, approximately 6.283).
The tangent of x is defined as sin( x ) / cos( x ).

RETURN VALUE:
The value of tan( x ) is returned.

SEE ALSO:
sin
cos

EXAMPLE:
float x;

x = tan( 3.14159 );
// x has now a value of (nearly) 0.
