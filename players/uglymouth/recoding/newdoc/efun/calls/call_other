EFUN: call_other

SYNTAX:
unknown call_other( ob, fun[, arg1, arg2, ...] );
  object ob | string ob;
  string fun;
  mixed arg#;

DESCRIPTION:
This calls a function 'fun' in an object 'ob'. If any arg# are given,
then these will be passed as arguments to 'fun'. 'Ob' can be given
as type object, or as type string. In the latter case the file_name
of 'ob' must be given. Using the -> operator, call_other can also be
called as ob->fun( arg1, arg2, ... ).

RETURN VALUE:
The value resulting from the evaluation of 'fun' is returned from
the other object. The type of that value is equal to the type of 'fun'.

SEE ALSO:
operators (->)
find_object

EXAMPLE:
if( (string)call_other( "room/adv_guild", "short" ) != "Adventurer's Guild" )
  log_file( "ILLEGAL", "Someone tempered with the Adventurer's Guild.\n" );
// Here the function short() is called in the Adv. Guild room object.
