This function is called from other players when they want to make damage to 
us. We return how much damage we received, which will change the attackers 
score. This routine is probably called from heart_beat() from another player.
The second argument is not necessary, and determines the kind of the strike. 
(0 .. AC  (eg normal hit),  !! here is bit dex involved !!

 2 .. dex (eg. falls or certain traps),

 6 .. chr (*shrug* maybe backstab?),
 7 .. undefined damage(no resistance!) )
