SAVINGS
-------

Savings are important for the spell-system. They will determine, how much
you are effected by a spell or if you are effected by a spell at all.
But savings are not only used by the spell-system. For example, an immunity
to poison will make you immune to any poison-attacks from a living or polluted
water too.

There are two different kinds of savings: Resistances and Immunities.

Immunities will make your immune to any effects of the "damage".
Resistance will lower the affects of the "damage" (and in very rare cases
   negate effects too)

Both are percentage values. Each time when you are hit by a spell or an
other kind of "damage", against which you have a saving-throw, it is calculated,
if you are immune or resistant to it. If you succeed in the immunity, you
will stay unharmed and nothing happens. If you fail your immunity, the
resistance is checked. If you succeed in the resistance, the effect is lowered
(or even negated at some special kind of attacks). If you fail, you will
suffer of the full force of the attack !

Currently are the following values predefined:

#define FIRE              1
#define ELECTRICITY       2
#define COLD              3
#define ACID              4
#define ENERGY            5
#define DRAIN             6
#define TOUCH             7
#define PETRIFICATION     8
#define POISON            9
#define BREATH            10
#define DEATHMAGIC        11
#define MAGIC             12
#define MINDEFFECTIVE     13
#define ILLUSION          14
#define SUMMONING         15        // incl. conjuration
#define NO_SAVE           16 

ONLY THESE VALUES MAY BE USED !!!

If you are designing a spell, check this list and decide, which one will
best fit your spell. But take care: Only in very view cases it is allowed
to use NO_SAVE at aggressive spells !
