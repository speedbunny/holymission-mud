MODIFY SAVING THROWS
--------------------

Saving-throws can be modified by armors or weapons. To do this, you must
inherit /obj/armour or /obj/weapon in your object. You also need to include
/spells/spell.h. This is the file, which contains the neccessary defines (look
at "man savings").

The modification are done by the functions:

   - modify_resistance( int which, int amount )
   - modify_immunity( int which, int amount )

'which' is the resistance/immunity you want to modify
'amount' is the value by which you want to modify the resistance/immunity
         (this can be negative)


RULES FOR MODIFICATION
----------------------

- The upper limit for the modification is 10. It is only in very rare cases
  allowed to cross this border. Normally modifications should not exceed 5.
- Items which modify savings must be very hard to obtain.
- Such items must be approved by an arch. Ignoring this rule will lead to
  demoting !!!
- You are also not allowed to create such items for your personal use only !
- You are not allowed to change the item after it is approved. You are also
  not allowed to change the way you obtain the item.
- Shadowing stats or savings is no longer allowed !!!
  The only exceptions are: guild-souls and spells. Anything else is considered
  illegal !

The arch, approving such items, must note them in /sys/saving_items.txt.
The name of the item, the modifications and how to obtain it must be noted.


NOTE: Stats can be modified in the same way. The function is
      - modify_stat( int which, int value )

      The same rules stated above apply here also !
