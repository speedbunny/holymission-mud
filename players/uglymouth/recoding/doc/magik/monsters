MONSTERS & MAGIK
----------------

Monsters are able to cast all standard-spells. Standard-spells are spells,
which are stored in the spell-master.

RULES
-----

Think what you do when adding spells to monsters. It is not allowed to give
a monster a spell like "slay living" with a chance of 100 % and a skill or
95%. This would be senseless. Use common sense when adding spells to monsters.
Consider, that spells casted by a monster are in general very deadly, especially
when the monster has a high level.

Only monsters who are logically able to use spells, should use them. These are
for example mages, priest, shamanesses, dragons, deathknights and so on.
Monster who cannot cast are snails, rabbits, orc-fighters and so on.

HOW TO "TEACH" A MONSTER TO CAST
--------------------------------

Add to the reset:

- set_language_skill( 2, 100 );
    this is the language magika, it is needed for the uttering of the words

- change_spell( nameOfSpell, currSkill, maxSkill, speed );
    nameOfSpell:  The name of the spell (e.g. magic missile)
    currSkill:    The current skill-value for the spell. It determines the
                  success of the casting
    maxSkill:     The maximum skilllevel the monster can achieve in this spell.
                  (Even monsters do learn while casting !!!)
    speed:        The speed of the spell. Do not misuses this value and give a
                  reasonable speed !

The handling of the spell is done in the method: concentrate( )

int concentrate( object vic )
   vic is the victim, i am currently fighting or NULL if i do not fight
   returns 0 if i do not want to cast or 1 if i start to prepare for a spell

The spell is initiated by the method: npc_process_spell()

int npc_process_spell( string nameOfSpell, string arg )
   nameOfSpell: the name of the spell i want to cast (e.g. "magic missile")
   arg:         the argument for the spell (e.g. "orc")
   returns:     1 if successfully initiated, otherwise 0
