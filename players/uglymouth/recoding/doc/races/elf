Elves are not strong, but they are very agile (although not as agile as
hobbits are). They have a slightly increased consitution, though it's not
obvious. They're beauty and charisma is well known, however, and since they
can become very old, they are a little bit wiser. They look like humans, but
they have less bodyhair.
