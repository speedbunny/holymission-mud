 
The definition of a wizard tool is as follows:
    Something which can be used to perform patches or commands on
    living or non-living items.
 
Such items may not be used by level NEWWIZ wizards, and it is now ILLEGAL for
any wizard to produce an item which may be used in this way by wizards of
level less than WIZ without obtaining the permission of an arch or god.
Further permission must also be obtained, from the same people, for any
modifications in any of the abilities of such an item.
 
IF YOU HAVE ANY WIZTOOLS IN YOUR DIRECTORY THIS WILL AFFECT YOU.
LONG-TERM POSSESSION AND/OR USE OF ILLEGAL WIZTOOLS WILL RESULT
IN DEMOTION, OR, IN CASES OF REPEATED OFFENCES, BANISHMENT. ABUSE
OF WIZTOOLS (YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS) WILL RESULT IN BANISHMENT.
 
All legal wiztools must have a copy in /tools. Any tool that doesn't
is considered illegal. Check this file for a list of LEGAL wiztools.

NOTE: JUST BECAUSE A WIZTOOL IS PERMITTED DOES *NOT* MEAN THAT YOU
      CAN USE ALL OF IT'S FUNCTIONS. THERE ARE MANY FUNCTIONS ON
      WIZTOOLS THAT CAN BE ABUSED. IF IN DOUBT, DON'T DO IT!
 
As a general rule of thumb, any function that you cannot perform yourself
by using a wizard command, is illegal. Please stick to this rule of
common sense. If a wiztool is not mentioned here, it means it has not yet
been checked by a responsible archwizard or God, and is not permitted.
Due to the abuse of wizard tools, rules are being tightened up on the use
of such items.
 
If you wish to code a tool or something special check with an Arch or God
or else you will be held responsible.
 
For clarification: Please contact an archwizard or god (or mail).
