NAME
    listwiz - list wizards

SYNOPSIS
    listwiz

AVAILABILITY
    Archwizard	command

DESCRIPTION
    The `listwiz' commands displays the contents of the interal
    master-variable wiz_info. Since this is a variable of type mapping,
    displaying its contents has to be handled from within the master
    object itself. Returning the variable would be a major security
    hole, since the parser returns a reference to the mapping rather
    than a copy (this also applies to any other array), making it possible
    for any given object to rewrite its contents.

    The data-portion of wiz_info is an array containing the level and
    the "mechanism" which set the wizard to this level. "mechanism" may
    be an arch-wiz (manual setting), or "wiz_scan", indicating the level
    was restored by the master-function scan_wiz, a method of restoring
    WIZSAVE.o from the player-files whenever this files was lost.
    for apprentice wizards, the mechanism will most likely be "advance",
    indicating the wizard was set on this level by the advance-function
    in the corresponding guild.

    wiz_info is used for notifications of pro- and demotes, and as
    fast lookup-cache for move_object() when checking the movement
    of (new-)wizard objects outside their testing area.

SEE ALSO
    wizlist, move_object

BUGS
    None known.

FILES
    /secure/WIZSAVE.o			the file where the contents of
					wiz_scan, among other data, is
					stored

    /secure/master.c			holds the variable lock_level and
					the modifying routines

    /sys/arch.c				contains the user interface
