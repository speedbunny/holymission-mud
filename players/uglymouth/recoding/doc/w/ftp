This is not a command, merely an info-file.

When connecting via 'ftp', just enter 'mud:{name}' (where {name} is your
wizard character name) and then enter your LPMUD password. Please
note that the 'dir' command does not work. The 'ls' command might
work depending on how old your 'ftp' program is. On newer 'ftp'
programs 'nlist' should give you a list of the files available.

There are two different hosts you can use to connect to NannyMUD via
"MUD-FTP". First, 'mud.lysator.liu.se' (130.236.254.13) is the best
choice if it works, and second 'emilia.lysator.liu.se' (130.236.254.15).

Please mail all bugs to Lpd (or pen@lysator.liu.se). The source is
available for anonymous FTP at 'ftp.lysator.liu.se' (130.236.254.1).
