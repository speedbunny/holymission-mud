 
For those wizards who need help understanding their role of
interacting with players, these are some rules that will be
upheld. The following are forbidden for wizards to do:
 
  - Give aid to players. This includes quest information,
    cloning objects for their benefit, transferring them to
    other places when not stuck, giving them xp, gold, etc
  - Hinder players. This includes attacking them, cloning
    harmful monsters/objects to/on them, prevent players
    from playing legally, etc.
  - Harrass players. This includes using profanity toward
    them, the excessive use of tells, emotes, spamming, etc.
 
These are a few examples and apply to testplayers too. Overall,
the wizard is here to create the world the player plays within.
