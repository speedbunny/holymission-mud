SET&QUERY - torch.c

Usual defined LFUN's:
set_weight(i),set_name(s),set_short(s),query_weight(),query_value().

set_smell(s): This sets the smell of the torch. This needs a \n.
              Example: set_smell("It smells like roses.\n");
set_fuel(i): This sets the amount of fuel (the number of seconds before the
             torch extinguishes) to i.
             Example: set_fuel(2000);
set_auto_light(i): if i is 0, the torch won't light without another light
                   available. If it is another value, it will light, but when
                   extinguished it disappears (like a match). Do NOT use
                   auto_light for things with a fuel >20. It was meant to make
                   things like matches.
                   Example: set_auto_light(1);
set_greek_fire(i): This is used to make it possible for a player to use a torch
                   underwater. This is useful sometimes, but don't make all
                   torches 'greek_fire' because it takes the fun out of diving.
                   If i=0 the torch will extinguish underwater. If i=-1 then
                   the torch will not only extinguish underwater, but will be
                   unable to light automatically in a environment that contains
                   a lot of fire.
                   Example: set_greek_fire(1);
query_auto_light(): This returns the value set by set_auto_light(i).
query_greek_fire(): This returns the value set by set_greek_value(i).
