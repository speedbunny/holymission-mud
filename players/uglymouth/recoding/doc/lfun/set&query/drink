SET&QUERY - drink.c

Usual defined LFUN's:
query_value(),query_weight().

set_value(s): This is NOT the usual set_value(i) function. This function is
              used to set all the parameters of the drink at one time. All
              parameters should be seperated by #. The first parameter is the
              name, the second is the short description, the third is the
              message that comes on the screen if you drink the drink, the
              fourth is the healing value of the drink, the fifth is the value
              in coins and the sixth and last is the alcohol strength of the
              drink.
              Example: set_value("beer#A beer#Glug glug#5#10#2");
set_pub(): This is used to set that the drink belongs in a pub, and can't be
           transported out of it.
           Example: set_pub();
set_food(i): If the drink is a food as well, use this variable to set this.
query_food(): This is to check if the drink can be called a food.
query_drink(): Returns 1, to identify this as a drink.
