void enter_inventory(ob)
object ob

This function is called whenever a player gives an item to another living
object. This can be used when giving quest-items to monsters. The prior
solution to this method was to "catch_tell" the actions in the room and
scan the catched string for the pattern "gives". This was a very unstable
method, because the action had to be made echo-proof. Don't use it any longer.

The function this_player() will return the player who is giving the item ob
to the other living object. It will NOT be the pointer to the living object.
To get the pointer to the living object, this_object() can be used.

Coding example:

enter_inventory(ob) {
  if (ob->id("ganja seed")) {
      next_out = "Lee says: Irie ! You did a quest !!!.\n";
      next_dest = this_player();
      set_heart_beat(1);
      this_player()->set_quest("ganja_seed");
      destruct(ob);
  }
}
