Legends:

Requirements for legends are:
   - You must be level 29
   - You must have more than 3.000.000 exp

If you fulfill these requirements you can go to your guild and type
"advance legend" in the guild room. By doing this you will become a legend.

Benefits for legends depend on the guild. At most guilds you will gain more
hit points and spell points and will get special abilities, like new spells
or skills.

A general benefit for legends is that they are allowed to change their title.
This can be done by: "title <your title>".
To remove your title, type "title none"

Experience you need as legends is shown by the command "help legendlevels"
