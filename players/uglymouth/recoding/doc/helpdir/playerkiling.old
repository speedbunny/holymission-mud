Player killing is allowed in Holy Mission.

But you have to fulfill the following requirement: You must have a PK licence.
This licence can be obtained in a small room somewhere to the north of the
main pub. It is bought at a price so be sure that you know what it is before
you obtain the licence. 

If you have the PK licence, you may kill everybody else who also has a
PK licence. It is not permitted to kill someone without such a licence.

Wizards will not meddle into the game. When you are killed by a player or
if there are gang fights, it is up to you to deal with it. Do as you please.
Actually it is forbidden to wizards to meddle into PK stuff if both players
are PKs.

BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER: ONCE YOU ARE A PK, YOU WILL STAY ONE !!!
                     DO NOT COME WHINING ABOUT IT; THERE IS NO
                     WAY TO CHANGE IT BACK !!!

Killing players in the church, the post office and in rooms with boards
(adventurer's guild, etc.) is forbidden and will be punished severely.
