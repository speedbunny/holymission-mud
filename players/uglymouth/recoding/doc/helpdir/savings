command:  savings
argument: none

This command will inform you of your current saving throws. Listed in the first
column are resistances against spells and listed in the second column are your
immunites.

Resistances are saving throws versus (magical) attacks. They will decide how
you suffer from a (magical) attack.

Immunities will make you immune versus (magical) attacks. If you are immune
versus a special kind of (magical) attack you will not suffer from that
particular attack.

Resistances and immunities will influence effects of poison and simmilar kinds
of damage too.

The values listed in the columns are percentage values.
