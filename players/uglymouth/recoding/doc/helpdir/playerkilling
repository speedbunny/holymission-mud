Player killing is regulated in Holy Mission.
All players and wizzes are required to know the rules on PKing.

Serial Killing is illegal and may be grounds for banishment.
Serial Killing is when one player kills multiple people for no
apparent reason in a rather rapid succession.  
   (So don't run around and attack everyone you see)

No one level 5 or below will be Playerkilled.
   (Lower levels are the foundation of the MUD and are to be cared for)

Valid reasons for Playerkilling are few.
#1 You are allowed to attack a player that repeatedly steals
   (Not if a player stole 100 coins from you.)
#2 You are allowed to attack someone who seriously harrassed you.
   (He spit at me, is not a valid defense)
#3 If you are attacked by a player and you kill him/her in self defense.
   (that is SELF-defense)
#4 To settle a dispute between 2 players.
   (AS LONG AS no one else is involved)
#5 ONLY valid group kill is when players hunt a Serial Killer.
   (If the wizzes don't get him first)

NOTE: All Playerkills are subject to the consideration and ruling of wizards.
