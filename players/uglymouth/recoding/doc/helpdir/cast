command:  cast '<spell>' [whom]
argument: at whom (monster/player) [optional]

With this command you are able to cast a spell.

The second argument [whom] is optional. When it is an aggressive spell
the spell will affect your current opponent or yourself if no argument
is given.

examples:
   cast 'magic missile' orc   you cast a magic missile at an orc
   cast 'magic missile'       you cast a magic missile at your current opponent
   cast 'armor' arthur        you cast armor at Arthur
   cast 'armor'               you cast armor at yourself

There is also the possibility to shortcut spells. You only need to type the
leading words of the spell and the spell which matches it best will be taken.
Find out by yourself how much you can shorten the name.

examples:
   cast 'magic missile' or cast 'magic m' will do the same.
