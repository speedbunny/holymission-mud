Gods are NOT allowed to enter the arena. However, you may take part of the
slaughter with your test player.

The procedure of joining is the same as for players, but there are certain
rules for gods which you need to follow:
- You may not use god commands in the arena or in the preparation room.
  Such commands are: heal, goto, clone, stat, snoop and so on.
- You may only use items that are in the mud and which may be found by players
  too. Special armours, weapons or items are not allowed.
- You are not allowed to use wizard tools.
- You are not allowed to use items that you've coded for your own private use.
- You are not allowed to use items which have special powers for gods.
- You are not allowed to assist with your god character.
- You are not allowed to modify stats guild, race ... while in the arena.
- You are not allowed to use "special" items which a player NORMALLY cannot 
  get after a hard fight with high risk of dying.
  (e.g. robe of the archmagi, white golden ring ...)
- Natural stats higher than your race-limit are illegal.
- Generally: You only may use items or abilities which a player NORMALLY can
             and may use.

If you are not sure about an item, use common sense. The above list does not
claim to be complete, so there may be still things that are illegal anyway.
Ask a higher god about items you are not sure of. If no higher level is on,
do not use the item.
Breaking these rules will lead to a warning. This warning is public and will
be posted in the preparation room of the arena. When you have three warnings,
you will be banished from the arena.
