 
If an illegal player killing has occurred, and appears to be that
way in the wizards judgement, then the perpetrator will be banished
for no less than one week, and depending on the situation other
punishments may befall him/her.
 
The player who was player killed will get a reimbursement of
10% of their experience post player killing. This will be a
standard reimbursement to aid them in recovery. This ruling takes
effect June 14, 1997, so do not ask for more or less after this time.
