Each player has six stats defined:

Str - Strength, affects your carrying capacity.
Dex - Dexterity, affects your fighting ability.
Int - Intelligence, affects your spell casting ability.
Con - Constitution, affects your health.
Chr - Charisma, used in trade.
Wis - Wisdom, used by the mages guild.

These values can be raised in the stat room (somewhere in the attic of
the church) by paying experience points. Any experience above your
level requirements can be used for this. The maximum values to which
you can raise your stats depends on your race and is reflected by
your initial stats when you first enter the game. The maximum levels
of the stats fluctuate around your maximum level.

Spell points and Hit points will not automagically increase
with levels: you need to advance the corresponding stats.
