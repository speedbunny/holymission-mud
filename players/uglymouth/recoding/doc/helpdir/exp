EXPERIENCE POINTS:

To gain levels or even to get better stats you need experience points.
Here on Holy Mission the experience points are divided into quest exp and
combat exp.

If your quest and your combat exp are 100 % you are ready to advance.
If you are a player under level 4 you don't need quest experience,
you'll get it automatically.

If you hate quests and still want to advance levels you will need 
more combat exp to equalize your lower quest exp.
The opposite is the case if you are a person who hates fights and
loves quests.

If you are not whether you can advance, just type score. There
will be a line that will state whether you are ready to advance
or not. :*)
