Help about spells:

Casting spells is a special ability of guilds which deal with magic. Only
this type of guilds can use spells.

There are different kinds of spells: aggressive spells, non-aggressive spells
and spells that cannot be cast in combat.

If you cast spells at an opponent, the opponent will have a saving throw
against the spell effect (depending on the spell). This will alter the effects
of the spells.

To get a list of spells you have, type "practice" or simply "prac".
