Note: Shout is the only channel on the mud that is monitored by
wizards. By monitored, it is meant that obscenities and excessive
use of long useless shouts are frowned upon. This includes the
shouting of control character.

This line is monitored since it is the only channel on the mud
which cannot be turned off. Please respect your fellow players.
