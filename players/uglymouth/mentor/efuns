Efuns

I won't even try to sum them all up. They are all neatly covered in
/doc/efun and /doc/efun/NEWPARSER. But you will mostly need only a few
of them. And I think you might want to be familiar with a few of them:

this_player() - refers to the player executing a command.
this_object() - refers to the object on which the code is located.
previous_object() - refers to the object making the call to a function. Note that
   this is this_object() if an object calls a function in itself.
call_other( object ob, string func, mixed args ) - is the same as the -> operator.
   It means: call function func in object ob with args as arguments.
set_light( int i ) - sets a light value to an object. 0 mean dark, even though
   you may look at it if there is enough external light, 1 radiates light with
   the equivalent of one torch. Higher and lower values may occur. Values
   put in set_light are cumulative within the same object.
add_action( string func, string cmd ) - relates a command cmd to a function func.
inherit - use the code of another object as a base for this object.
clone_object( object ob ) - makes a clone of object ob.
call_out( string func, delay sec, mixed args ) - calls function func in
   this_object() after sec seconds of time with arguments args.
write( string msg ) - prints message msg to this_player()'s screen.
say( string msg ) - sends a message to all livings (players and monsters), except
   this_player(), who are in the same room as this_player().
transfer( object ob1, object ob2 ) - moves object ob1 into the inventory of ob2.

This covers the most used and easy to use efuns, I guess.
I hope it makes a little sense to you.
