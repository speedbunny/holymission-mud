Here's a short survey of what to do and, as important, what not to do
to prepare for becoming newwiz.

1) Do the Apprentice Quest. You will find it at the same location as the
   Newbie Quest for mortals. It will give you a general outline of what
   it means to be wizard and how the mud works.

2) Read throught both the player and wizard books at the sheriff's office,
   if you haven't done so already as part of the Apprentice Quest.

3) Most boring, but nevertheless required: reading docs.
   You don't need to read them all. For one, not all of them will make sense
   at this time. And some docs are obsolete by now that they contain bad
   information you shouldn't even pick up as apprentice wizard.
   Concentrate on /doc/LPC, /doc/build, /doc/rules and /doc/examples.
   However, don't read: /doc/build/Roomobj*, /doc/build/door, /doc/build/ed*,
   /doc/build/std*, /doc/LPC/closures, /doc/examples/NEW_WIZ, /doc/examples/exa07.

4) Read through the files in this directory.

5) Talk to me. Specially if things are unclear. Starting to code is easy,
   and most so if you are given a quick start. As apprentice don't try to
   focus on coding too much though. Try to get a broad picture of wizardhood,
   what you can do, what you can't do and why (not), where to find things,
   and a few coding basics. This should be enough to become newwiz within a week
   or so, if you put some time in it.

Good luck!!
