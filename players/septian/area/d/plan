/ The mysterious Hall of the Unknown, whose locks were picked /
/ by the infamous Septian, is finally opened. And recent reports/
/ state that noone has come out alive. Not to strange considering/
/ it's right in the heart of the Orc Valley. Unbeknowest of the/
/ common adventurer, the hall leads to a portal in which leads/
/ to another land, a land of treachery, of murder and scandal,/
/ to another land, a land of thieves, of treachery, of murder/
/ and scandal, of lies, lust and sin, and of all things unholy. /
