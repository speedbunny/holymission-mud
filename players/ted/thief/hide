Hide

Often times, thieves need a place to hide.  This being the case,
thieves learn to utilize any nook, cranny, crevice or shadow to hide
in.  A thief that is hidden cannot be attacked, and will stay hidden
until they choose to reveal themselves.  Of course, while the thief is
hidden, he or she may have only limited interaction with the rest of
the world.
