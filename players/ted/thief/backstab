Command: Backstab
Syntax: backstab <players/monster>

	This command can only be done before you are engaged in combat.
If done on a non-agressive monster or a player, it will start a fight.
Backstab uses your knowledge of anatomy and your ability to suprise your
opponent to do massive damage.  This damage will increase as you gain
in levels.  Of course, the better your weapon, the more damage done.
