Poison
syntax: throw <direction>
Cost: 80. Fail: 30

Poison is to be dropped in an area, then you must throw it in a direction.
This stops a player entering that direction, also giving it damage. To get past
the poison you must sneak past the direction you set it to. The chance of it 
working depends on level and intelligence.
 Poison deteriorates after a while.
