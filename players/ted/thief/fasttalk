Fasttalk <victem>

From time to time, thieves find themselves in a spot of trouble, and
the skill of talking fast often saves their skins.  Successfully
fasttalking a player or monster will cause them to reconsider their
violent actions, and give the prudent thief time to think and/or
escape.  A thief's probability for success increases 5% for each level
earned, and is modified by the thief's charisma.
