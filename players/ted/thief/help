	The main functions of a thief are stealing, hiding and sneaking.
The main weapon of the thief is the backstab, a suprise attack usable only
once per combat.  While the thief is not as strong a fighter as the warrior
he has one spell which he has learnt by watching others. He can explore safely
and effectivly.  He/she/it can sneak past monsters that would stop others
and steal items that would otherwise require dangerous and time consuming
battles. The thief is a good stand alone adventurer or an excellent addition
to any party.  However, many thieves arn't liked or trusted, so you must
be sure to stick together and help each other out whenever possible.

The current thief commands are:

steal, hide, unhide, weave, backstab, sneak, money, missile, shock.
follow, unfollow, fasttalk, appraise, gossip, brew.
