new_text "Right.  I posted my message a year and a half ago, a new wiz, didn't\nknow a semi-colon from a comma.\n\nThings are happening. First I coded an area, then I coded a\nquest.  Next challenge, I pondered...\n\nAnd this is it now.  I'm re-structuring whatever I can. Summoners\ncan come back. They can come back and kick ass.  They can\ncome back, be cool, keep the memories of Matt alive and\ncreate some new legends along the way.\n\nThank to Tats for the inspiration, and thanks to Mangla\nfor listening to my whining.\n\nRedsexy\n"
