*Issue: Ok, lets make this official... Here's the job desc:

Responsibilities: Agouron, a fully integrated pharmaceutical company, is a
recognized leader in the field of structure-based drug design. Join us in
the challenge of great science. BS/MS, Medicinal Chemistry: We have
positions open for synthetic organic chemists to be part of a
multidisciplinary team focused on identifying new drug candidates. The
positions require planning and conducting multistep syntheses to prepare 
target molecules. Responsibilities also include interpretation of
spectroscopic data, use of the literature to solve synthetic problems, and
application of modern chromatographic techniques for the purification of 
synthetic targets. Excellent organizational, analytical, and problem
solving skills are required. Candidates must have a strong capacity and
enthusiasm for doing modern experimental synthetic chemistry. Agouron
offers competitive salaries and benefits.

I'm guessing that pay would be in the $40 - 50,000 range since I have a
Ph.D. (but I could be way off). It's located in San Diego, which would
mean a relocate for us, or ALOT of commuting. ;)
