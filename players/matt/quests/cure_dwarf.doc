Cure the Old Dwarf
---- --- --- -----

A quest by Matt for Holy Mission
8-2-93

    In the Plains of the New World is a hut, in which lives a poor old dwarf
who is very sick. The player must find this dwarf, and listen to his ravings.
Among them are clues hinting at a "dream" in the Eastern Forest. The dwarf
also says that he needs fruit from the Tree of Life to be saved.
    The player must first go to the sleepy copse in the Eastern Forest, to
get some clues as to how to proceed. The player falls asleep and dreams,
and the dream gives hints.
    Next, he must go to the shop in Dyolf City and buy a glass prism, become
a frog somewhere, and return to the Eastern Forest. Then he must find the
fallen tree, move it, and get another player to dig and unearth a box, which
contains a pair of spectacles. The spectacles allow the player to read
everything that is written in the forest. There is a stump which, when read,
says "Gaiea", and on the glass prism is the word "fill".
    The player then has to find a pool with blue water, with which he fills
the prism. Now the prism reads "smash". Then he must go to the huge Oak,
upon which is written "speak her name to call her". He then speaks the name
from the stump, and Gaiea is called. She says that the player must kill
the black dragon and give her its heart.
    He then goes to the split tree and enters the crack, and searches. He
will find a knife. He then must go to the Western Forest, find the black
dragon, and kill it and the surrounding trees, and then cut out its heart
with the knife. Next he takes the heart back to the Oak, calls Gaiea, and
gives her the heart.
    In return, she gives him a seed; he must find the grove in the forest
which has a circle of light, plant the seed in the circle, and then smash
the prism, which will then cause a rain to fall and water the seed. A tree
will sprout, and eventually grow to full size. Then fruit may be picked
for the old dwarf.
    All that remains is to bring the fruit back to the dwarf and give it
to him. As a reward, the dwarf gives the player a glowing gem.
