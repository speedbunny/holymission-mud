VAGABONDS OF SPACE AND TIME

  One of the more unorthodox guilds of this mud is the mystic group of
wanderers of Space and Time. Members are basically wanderers who have
mastered the realms of Space and Time. Through the harnessing of the
powers of Space and Time, they have become a powerful group of people
who fight for order in the world. They are nicknamed the Knights of 
Order. Whether they are black knights or white knights they maintain order
so do not mistake them for goody-two-shoes. 
  While they do not have particularly powerful spells, they are very
resourceful with their powers and can whittle down an enemy quite
effectively.
