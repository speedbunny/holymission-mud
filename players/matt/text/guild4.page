    Members of the Jedi Guild have many useful powers. Not only are they
strong in battle, using their lightsabers, attack spells, and parrying,
but they also skilled in perception, able to find where any creature
resides, "suggest" creatures to do things, and cure themselves. Attack
spells include lightning, bolt, and "fear".
