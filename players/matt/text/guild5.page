    The Mages are a pure-magic group, weak physically but strong mentally.
They possess many powerful spells which have widely varying effects. Some
of the attack spells are blast, crush, and fireball, and defense spells
such as "shield" and invisibility can protect them. Mages can create light
at will, magically unlock doors, create illusions, and teleport, among
other things. Though they cannot use most weapons and armour, they can
create a magical staff which they can use in battle.
