MONKS

    The Monk Guild is mostly concentrated on combat, although they do have
a few other abilities as well. In general, they need no weapons, relying on
their bare hands and feet to get multiple strikes in battle, and no armour,
concentrating on "aikido" for a natural armour. Attack ablities include
choking the opponent, smashing it, and "death". Monks can also charm an
opponent, or judge how powerful it is. In addition, they can discharge the
power of their enemies, and meditate for faster healing.
