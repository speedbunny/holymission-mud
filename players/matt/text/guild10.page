    Barbarians truly live up to their name. They are a brutish bunch,
very strong in combat if their skills, which they raise by training, are
high. In combat they have such abilities as throwing objects at their foes,
entering melee to bash every enemy, kick, punch, and body-slam. They can
also devour the corpses of those they defeat to regain some power.
