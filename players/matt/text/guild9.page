    Summoners are a dark, mysterious band of magic-users who have mastered
the black arts of gating creatures from other dimensions to do their bidding.
They are weak physically, but can summon powerful monsters to attack for
them, and create golems for defense. In combat they can combine Elements to
attack and defend, and they can summon creatures to communicate, light up
rooms, explore, and carry things for them. They also possess a Brooch which
can store power for later conversion into hit points and spell points.
