NINJAS
------

Created by:    Patience
Maintained by: Dice

    Ninjas are very strong in combat; they can throw objects at their
enemies, use karate, and wield two weapons. They can also parry and dodge,
and have the ability to meditate to revive themselves, though they cannot
use most armour. Ninjas are a skills-based guild; they must train to
increase their skills. They can, in addition, see in the dark, "spy" to
see adjacent rooms, and hide themselves.
