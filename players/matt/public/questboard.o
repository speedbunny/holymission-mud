tmp_text "1) Who is threatening to remove quests? I didn't see it.\n2) There is a major difference between being told where to go to start a quest,\n  and being told how to complete a quest.\n 3) You cannot justify cheating by saying \"Since I don't know how to do\n  this quest, I must have someone show me\", which is another way of saying\n  \"...there are not enough clues\"\"...we are not mind-readers\".\n4) Any quest I worked on that had a bug, the bug was fixed as soon a \n  high ranking wiz was aware of the problem.\n5) What the heck do you mean by passwords? Do you have trouble logging on?\n\nThere is a difference between a game mud and a social net. This is a game.\nA game is not fun without a certain amount of challenge. Sure, there is\na lot of social interaction here, and I am not knocking that at all, but there is a problem to solve in this game that requires some effort or is no fun.\n\nIf you can write a quest that is better then the ones here, by all means,\ndo so. If you are apprentice, you will not be always. If you are new,\nyou have everything you need.\n\n(Yow! Some of these europeans are better at English then I am!)\n\n\n**\nI think Saffron was referring to one quest which required \nyou gaining a password, to release an AnySlayer sword.\nNow, this particular password was misspelt, which makes it\nincredibly difficult to discover by 'normal' means...\n\n\tElemental Tamina\n\n\n**\nThe only time i truely cheated, i got banished for, and by the way, i know that least 50% of wizards have cheated. The thing is, asking for where a person's are is, is technically cheating. There aren't enough hints given. I would like to see someone solve the King Dmitri quest without a hint, the Anyslayer, The island dragon, the wolf quest, etc. I bet $100 you have cheated more than once.\n\n\n**\nthe help hern quest has a \" \" space in it instead of the \"_\"\nCould this be fixed so that we can adjust players before too\nmany solve it and it becomes harder to do?\n\n-Mangla\n\n\n**\nMaybe you are right stanley, but since i know of more than 10\nof our current active wizards who used one of my quest solutions\ni recknon i am justified in saying what i said about current wizzes\nand cheating\n\nTex\n\n\n**\nKyoshi quest revised after 10th player solved it.\nDescriptions cleared up.\n\nTats\n\n\n**\nDue to the free doom slave quest, I am rewriting my free the slaves uest.\n\nAlso I am working on a second quest revolving around faeries.\nExos\n\n\n**\nThe whale in the ishikawa quest has been made less confusing\nit was the major stumbling block for most players\n\n\n**\n\n\nI have an idea that might work. As others have said\nearilier that many players get frustrated at questing because\nthey don't know where to start. A possible idea is to create\n'A Hall of Learning' where players can learn of places on the\ngame and have to have basic knowledge of where things are to \nfind the areas as per described. Almost like a book on every\nwizards area and roughly were it is located or how to go about\nfinding where it is located. If possible can a higher wiz okay\nthis - it might solve a lot of things/problems on the game.\n\nUnsure Ap\n\n\n\n\n**\n\nI guess no one reads this board!\n\nAp\n\n\n\n**\nUntrue...some of us do read the board...\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have the power to do much with it...\n\nH.\n\n**\nThree minor quests installed for samurai only, no quest points\nawarded, even though two of these are more involved than most\nof the quests on the mud.\n\nDine with the Emperor.\nAppease the Kami.\nHonor Lord Raiden.\n\n\nTatsuo\n\n\n**\nsounds good ap., is always nice to know where to start! :*)\n\n**\nHonor Lord Raiden...\nI dont remember him leaving my area to become a Samurai..\nHave to have a talk with that boy... *GRIN*\n\nGumbo\n\n**\nHave a new quest ready, waiting for approval.  Its a quest based on puzzles,\n and requires no fighting (though there are monsters in the area, it is not\nnecessary to engage them).  There are 3 puzzles in the quest, each is of moderate difficulty.  THe first is just minesweeper, which isn't so much\na puzzle as it is a game, though there are certain elements of logic\nnecessary to win.  The second is a puzzle involving 12 coins, one of \nwhich is counterfeit and distinguishable only by wieght, and a balancing\nscale.  The last is a chess-based puzzle involving only the knights and a\n3x3 board.  None of the puzzles are all that hard, and a file containing the solutions is posted in\n/players/kawai/areas/games/ as are the rest of the files.  Knowing the \nsolutions, it takes about 10-15 minutes on a slow link (14.4k dialup)\nto complete the three, since both minesweeper and the chess game rely\non visual representations of the board, though if you're good at\nminesweeper you really don't have too look at the board all that much.\n\nThe puzzles are coded so that only one person may try at a time, and it does remember where a person left off, so long as they haven't logged off since trying a puzzle...\n\nAs for players just solving by script, its not really possible, since minesweeper is different each game, and while the chess\ngame can be played by script, the coin game can not be, since the coin\nchanges each time (there is, however, a simple solution that can be\nscripted, with the results compared to a table...requires knowing the\nmathematical proof/solution to the puzzle though...otherwise its left to players ingenuity....)\n\nAnyway, I'd appreciate feedback on this quest, whether or not its too\ndifficult or not.  Also, feel free to debug (though should be fairly bug\nfree...been in the works for a while as just games to play, thought I'd\ntry integrating into a quest).  TO enter the area, goto /players/kawai/areas/games/start\n\n-K\n\n**\nJust wanted to say, that when I was a player, I thought puzzle quests were absurd, sometimes a waste of time(king dmitri) and does not really fit the flow of the game. Minesweeper is a game anyone can play who has windows, why put it on the mud too?? Just voicing an opinion,\nTanis\n\n**\nWhy don't puzzles fit the flow of the game?  Experience is supposed to\nbe a combination of physical development as well as mental development, and\nlogic games have been around since people started thinking.  Besides, why\nadd another quest that just requires killing a bunch of monsters, which\nis what most of the quests on here are.  non-killing quests also\nallow low-level players to accomplish somewhat challenging quests\nwithout fear of death and such.  It just seems that right now\nthe quests are easy really easy or require tremendous amounts of killing, few quests in between....\n\nAs for minesweeper, that doesn't necessarily have to be part of the quest,\nits just there becuase I happened to have it coded at the time...there are\nplenty of other puzzles to put in, and after time the quest can change\nby substituting new puzzles (even just pick randomly from a library of puzzl\nI just happened to like minsweeper because it varies, and players\ncan't script solutions to the quest, which is a problem around here.\n\n-K-\n  -Who thinks guilds/combat have gotten way out of hand\\\n\n\n**\nPlayers are really tired of solving puzzles while they don't get enuf infos\non quests. Why should they care of these stupid puzzles...? Just check out the\ngannja puzzle no wizs can actually think that this one is really enjoyable.\n\nThorm\n\nPS: Once again , quests should be difficult and hard to figure out BUT they\nstill have to be LOGICAL, and ENJOYABLE. :)\n\n**\n\nThe reason you guys dislike puzzles is that you cannot cheat on\nthem like every other on - get over it you are wizzes now and you\nshould care about what types of quests are good or not - we are trying\nto stop the immense amount of cheating that has hit holy mission with\nsome great force - some quests that soltions have been out on are\ndone every time it resets because people know how to them - take white\ntower - how many players solved it when it first came out - a few now\nlook around and many have irt cause the solnt is out - first hand experience\non that quest - takes roughly 3 days to solve to the point that you can take th\n\nthe next day and go through the hole quest to do it - it is so spread out that \nis tough to do ... thus you have to \ntake the time to put all of the pieces together and considering\nhow purely goldsun's english is and his syntex the quest becomes even\nharder - so you tell me how any under lvl 29 can even do that quest\nwithout a solution becaues it _requies_ a hell of a lot of knowledge\non the game and where everything is!!! \n\nSummary - puzzles stop cheaters - so put em in and put them in\nbunches -- that will stop such assine walk thoroughs of 8 or 10% quest\nrating in a little over 10 mins!!!\n\nApollo - the one sick of cheaters\n\n\n**\njust like to say that every single puzzle quest out there has people cheating on, in fact I have seen more people cheat on the puzzle quests, like Dmitri and ganja, etc.......\nTanis\n\n**\nSome puzzles can be cheated...like I said in my first note, two of the\npuzzles can be somewhat scripted.  One can be entirely scripted, though\nits somewhat long (16 moves).  Another can be scripted so a player can compare results to a table, and the\nother just relies on logic and skill, since its randomized each time.\nThe other thing I was hoping to do , in an effort to make quests\ncheat-proof, is to create a library of short puzzles, maybe 9 or 10,\nand just have the quest be random combinations of them.  Given the fact\nthat a player can't predict which puzzle will show up, it makes it really\nhard to cheat, and I doubt few people would go through the trouble of doing\nthe quest over and over to solve all the puzzles, for the sole purpose\nof providing others with the answers (and if they do, just make more\npuzzles).  \n\nThe bright side of all this is that it isn't that unfair either,\nMy quest doesn't require people to travel to strange places in \ntotally unrelated areas of the mud, all the puzzles are self-contained,\nand require no prior knowledge or special items.  They're just fun\nand challenging puzzles for people of all levels to solve, and if you \ntry the quest out, you'll see it has a little story line too...\n\n-K- \n sick of cheaters, overpowered guilds, invulnerable monsters, etc...\n\n**\npost re:kawai\nOk, I just hope the puzzles will have to do with the context of a fantasy world, relevant to the game :*)\ntanis\n\n**\nHey I'm not against puzzles....I just don't think that puzzles can solve\nthe problem of cheating.\nOnce again: If you make a quest ENJOYABLE...(with or without puzzles it\nreally doesn't matter) players will not cheat this much.\nJust try to think guys ... :) The MUD is extremely big. Quests are very \ndifficult to solve sometimes. Some quests could be done by more players at\na time. Some of the quest object could 'fade away' when you drop them or\njust want to put them into a sack....(i.e. Shao Kahn quest > dolls) There\nare absolutely not enough hints and clues for the solutions etc. etc.\nSo even though some players would like to solve a quest by themselves \nthey always have to face these kind of difficulties...so they usually \ndecide on cheating. (If you know what I mean... :) )\nIn my oppinion, well designed and structured puzzles are cool...\nbut they just cannot offer solution to our problem...\n\nThorm\n\nP.S.: if you need assistance let me now...I can take a look at your quest\nand tell what I'd change... :) \n\n**\nI really like the 'Help Yorel' quests method of only letting 1 player work on\nthe quest at a time. If this is applies to more quests, then if someone decides\nthat they need to work on it, and someone is already doing the quest, at least\nit might be at least expected that some quest objects are missing.\n\nOh, well. I'm not going to get too caught up in this one. \n\nMe.\n\n**\n\nWell the idea is cool...cooler than nothing at least.\nBut quests do need to be changed...I still offer you my help...\n\nYour Thormy\n\n**\n I finished the coding of my quest. I would be glad if it will be added\n so if you can add it read the file /p/sed/quests/free_promet.doc\n There is more info about it. If you will have any questions about it then tell me\n\n  Thank in advance\n                              your SEDUCER   :))\n\n**\nBelushi says he gave the chaosblade to the captain.\nWhen IHe said nothing happened.\nWhen I arrived, the captain did have the chaosblade.\nBelushi says he was invis when he gave it to the captain.\n\nI told him to ask a Lord or higher about this matter.\n\nThanks,\nTopaz\n\n\n\n**\n\nCan it be re-installed ...\n\nA.\n\n\n**\nIm coding new quest Helping to Black Evil and hes sisters..\nAfter some time it will be done..\nBrb, but why Im posting it???\nLast note before my was only in 29Jan????!!\n*Dragonn*\n\n**\nI have sat here and read every note here and there seems to \nbe two different ways of thinking on hm, if this is not cured\nthere will always be contention among wizes.  make a quest\neasy enough to be fun and allowalbe to most levels and they will \nall get solved to quick.
