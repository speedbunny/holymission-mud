All of these rooms and files originally belonged to a wiz named kelly
he has not been here as of late, well for a really long time so i picked
them up as a pet project of something to do, that is recode them since 
the rooms were coded a long time ago and need to be redone.  In my not
so humble opinion.  However the point is this:  these rooms originally 
were coded by him and would not be a part of the mud without him, so my
hat is off to him.
