Many thieves have\ncommented on the idea that they still need a torch to hide in the shadows\nof a dark room. Perhaps a 'scout' command with the arguement 'here' will\nallow the viewing of a dark room. Other arguements could be added as well,\nnamely the dest_dir of a given room which would let the thief see the\nlong_desc of the adjacent room. IMHO dark rooms should not be able to\nbe seen from another room so you might want to take that into concideratiion.\n\n\tAnother idea; 'disguise' and 'impersonate'. Disguise would allow the\nthief to alter either name or race for a given duration, or ending when \nin combat (rather hard to hide who you are when someone is fighting you).\nI am sure this would be relatively easy using shadows() and all. Impersonate\nwould work in a similar way; allowing the thief to speak in a room as\nif they were another. For example, you a thief could 'impersonate airborne'\nfollowed by the typical message. If successful players would read the \nmessage as coming from me instead of you. Failure would give a message\nlike 'Herp tries his best to impersonate Airborne and says: ...'\nTwo fun and not unbalancing ideas, and cannot be used in combat.\n\n\tThe last idea would be 'fencing'. Not swordplay, but rather selling\nvaluables. The price would reflect the thief's CHR and might give a little\nover the common price. Or maybe, you might allow selling of items with\nvalue over 1000 coins to have a chance of success.\n\n\tOh, one more. 'Palming' or the ability to hide an item on ones person.\nThis would either change the short of an item in a players inventory,\nor mask it entirely. Could be useful.\n\n\tWell here are some to concider. Enjoy and long live the Thieves.\n\n\n**\ntmi.ccs.northeastern.edu 5555\n\n\n**\n> Airborne says: 138.40.11.1 6999 is lpcc.\n@Spool has gone linkdead.\nAirborne says: 192.92.115.10 2222 is genocide\n\n\n\n**\n\n  /players/mangla/bin has a test bin in it. It's called _test.c\n\n  /players/mangla/guild/guild.c is an inheritable file which captures\nplayer cammands checks the /players/mangla/bin directory for the command.\nIf it exsits then it will execute the appropriate function for the player.\n\n  /players/mangla/obj/soul.c is the file you need to clone to test _test.c.\nNotice how short the file is. It never needs to get much bigger than that. All\ncommands can be created like _test.c was. And it save quite a bit of memory,\nsince the guild members are sharing the same commands. You don't load a new\ncommand for every member :)\n\nIf you have any questions, talk to Scooter. It's his code. :)\n\nMangla\n\n\n\n**\nbeispiel:\n\n  map_array(users(),#'environment())\n  map_array(usesr(),#'call_other,\"query_real_name\")\n\n\n\n**\n*sigh* I do not know what is happening but lately I have had\nitems disappearing from my inventory. I believe jewel had the\nthing happen to her.  I have been loosing the guild soul I clone\nbut I beleived tht may have been due to errors. I am not so sure\nanymore. Today I lost my guild changer. I have had that since I\nbecame a wiz. *shrug* I thought you might want to know about this\nnice little occurance. It is a inconvience to me but could\nbe a big problem for the mud. :)\n\n\tJust something else for you to think about.\n\n\t\t\t\tMangla\n\n\n**\ndalmore.mcs.dundee.ac.ul\n\n\n**\nviking.pvv.unit.no\nhaldde.hifm.no:2001\n\n**\nNeed to have a quick conversation abotu some things please.\nFirst could you please restart the FTP deamon.\nSecond some matters of bamishment.
