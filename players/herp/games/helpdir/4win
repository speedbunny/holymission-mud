This game is played by two human players.

It is called "connect 4", which means that 4 stones from a player in a row win.
It doesn't matter if the stones build a horizontal or a vertical line, even
a diagonal line is valid.

Allthough the game is called "4 wins", it is not neccessary that a line must
be built with 4 stones. You can adjust the game parameters with the 
make command. It's syntax is: "make <xsize> <ysize> <num>", where
<xsize> is the height of the game and <ysize> is the widht. <num> is an 
optional parameter wich specifies how many lines in a row win.

To make your move, simply type the number of the slot in which you want
to insert your stone.

Note: Before you can start to play, you have to "register" first.
