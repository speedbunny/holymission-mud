dodge: no command

The very dextrous thief is always quick enough to dodge the attacks
of his/her enemy. Of course, you should not wear much armour, which
makes you move around more slower, makeing it unable to dodge.
A very charismatic person will also be able to fear his/her enemy,
thus not get hitten as hard as a standard stupid adventurer.
