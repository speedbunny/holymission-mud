command: sneak
arguments: direction

Another vital ability of the thieves is to sneak past monsters.
No more worrying about foolish muscleman who stupidly want
to block your way ! You are much to sly for them !
But be carful to sneak in the right direction. If you are not carefully
enough, you will only hurt yourself.
