command: picklock
argument: door

Picklocks are needed to use this ability. No matter how firm a door has been
built, it cannot withstand a dextrous and skilled thief !
Hahaha, will they ever learn how to help themselves against being robbed ?
You can buy picklocks at our guildshop, and sometimes there are some in the
hideout. But be careful not to ruin them !
