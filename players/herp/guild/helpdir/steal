command: steal
arguments: item, monster
syntax: steal <item> from <monster>

One of the most vital abilities of the thieves is stealing, of course.
You can steal almost everything from everywhere, but beware, that your
victim doesn't notice you ! Monsters will immediately start to attack you,
and players will see who is doing this job.
You can steal stuff, but no worn armour or wielded weapon.
You also can steal coins from monsters or players (if they have some, after
all the thieves working on them :-)
