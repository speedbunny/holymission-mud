command: weave
argument: a monster or player

The most intelligent people in the mud (the thieves, heh) always are able
to confuse their attackers. Suddenly your attacker will forget whom to fight,
and start to attack another monster near you. But be carefully not to choose
the wrong opponent ... if your confusing fails, he will attack you twice !

Cost: 30 spellpoints.
