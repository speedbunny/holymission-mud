command: hide
Two foms: a) with no argument

Hide in the shadows. You use your thief skill to get almost invisible for
players and monsters. How long you stay hidden depends on how dexterous and
skilled you are as a thief.
You can't of course always hide, because hiding requires time and peace to
search for a proper place. You also cant attack if you are hidden.

b) with an object as argument

Hide an object. Take care to remember where you`ve hidden it. Hidden objects
will stay at the same place until next reboot.
