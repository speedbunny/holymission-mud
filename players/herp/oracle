The Usenet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
Your question was:

> Oh wise Oracle, who never lets a question go unanswered, who knew what
> my question would be long before the day my grandmother was born,
> please grant me an answer to my question:
>
> To which doctor should I go for sexual reassignment surgery?

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

} Now why trust anything that serious to a doctor?  I say go the
} "Do-it Yourself" route..

} The Loose Tooth Method:
} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
} Obtain a length of wire or twine.  Tie one end to genitals.  Tie other
} end to doornob on open door.  Make sure cord is taut.  Slam door.
}
} Note that this can also be acomplished in a simalar fassion by tying
} the other end to a cinder block instead of a door knob, and throwing
} the block off of a cliff or tall building.   However, this method has
} proved fatal in many instances where, at the last moment, an individual
} has changed his mind and jumped after the block.

} The "Look over there.. whoops, was that your penis?" method:
} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
}
} ^C--Terminated.
}
} Hmmm.. I think you get the general idea.
}
} You owe the oracle a second thought.
