tmp_text "I vote no ... I hope what you guys are doing to us here in RL ?I cant think I would like to discuss with Helenette about Mud related stuff,because she is a woman who really smells bad from here mouth andwashes herself rarely .....Oh well .... Herp**I vote yes because Helenette reputedly has a good knowledge of programmingand because she could contribute to the MUD if she had a chance to. Keepingher at level 29 forever won't solve anything, but if she is allowed to wizit could be a move everyone could profit from. I know that it is easy forme to cast this vote without having seen (or smelled) her, but I still thinkthat she dereves a fair chance.-Silas**I dont want the FETTE HELENETTE in this MUD !NO NO NO NO NO NO !!!Wolfi !**I think itisnt fair to banish her all the time**I DO want Helenette to become wiz. Physical features should not influencewhether a player is allowed to wiz or not.If this were the case, you two guys, Dago and Herp, would have to bebanished immediately if that were possible.                                   Zaphod**I vote yes, she has been a player long enough and reputedly can code welland probably could improve the mud in general. Personal life should beexcluded from mud life, if u cant keep it that way you shouldnt play. IfYou dont want to talk to her about something in the mud then tell her, dontbe a biased fool and operate different rules for some players and othersfor other players. Rules are or should be there. If not make them.		Kaz**Diese Abstimmung is der groesste Schwachsinn den ich je gesehen habe !!!Und alleine die note vom WOLFI **laugh** is der ueberhaupt da ????Wie kann man nur so eine SCHEISS idee haben =???Und die note vom herp (gestank) is auch PURER scheiss (so was in nem mudauf einem board)=SPINNST DU HERP ?????Dass der dago wenns um die helenette geht sowieso durchdreht weis ich (quest)Scheiss auf diese Abstimmung !!!!IHR ARSCHLOECHERcapa**Hi !Why not, by the way she is better contollable as 31 er wizthan as 29 player. In fact she is sometimes a bit mad, butI dont see any serious reason to banish her.**I can think of a hell of a lot of people who would (and have done)make worse wizards than her, and I've yet to see anyone give onegood reason as to why she shouldn't be made wiz.Also, the way she has been treated *SUCKS* , in my opinion.                     [*MOONCHILD*]**What a FUCKING idea!!!!!!!!!**who tries to cheat by using other wizards characters???**YES** I still think herp should of done the banishment on his own. its hisown mud, and the word GOD on this mud is trying to indicate that he/shecan do whatever he/she wants to do with his/her damn mud.tomorrow we could all be banished and it'd be ok, cuz its his mud.anyway, i don't want to put up with her once she gets on. but it looks like most people are voting yes, which is ok, cause ifshe messes around, she can still be banished, just like Whisky said.besides, wouldn't she just start over as level 1? Then keep quiet aboutwho she really is, and then wiz, and we'd never know who it really was.go figure. zix**Ok, i could agree  (it seems  that i have to) to  whisky that  its better  tohave a 31 wiz then a bored 29 player.But who the hell told you all that she can code?As  for the  argument that  physical apearence/real life  SHOULD  be kept outof the mud: RIGHT!, but  its a  two-way function  which  means  that she alsoshould not bore other wiz/player physically  outside the mud as she did often enought.The voting  as such  is our try  to keep  quite fair. Voting new wiz is usualin other  muds, i think  we should  establish  it here too. There are 70 wiz-chars in this mud which i think is near the upper limit.Beeing  fair  means, i DON'T just  shoot her out, set her to level 1 or closethe mud at all. Instead i  try to  discuss the problem.  Therefore i really don't  understandcomments like "ARSCHLOCH" ("asshole", hi capa, ever learned to type english?)or f.e. zaphod, our megawiz in copying some files and disappearing afterwards.Fine, here again my arguments against her:	* She doesn't  distinguish between real life and the mud, which is 	  most annoying for people beeing here.	* She plays/played with 5 or more chars at the same time, which is	  considerd to be not legal in any mud i know.	* She can't code, at least not C.	* She helps  other players solving quests, which is also generally 	  considerd to be unfair.	* ... i generally don't like her, but thats no real argument.So i vote NO.-- Dago**my note on the fameboard is already gone i saw, so i ll repeat it here:- She works hard to become wiz.- Maybe she had mre chars in past, she has only Helenette now.- Helenette doesnt cheat.- others cheat against her all the time.- who can code has advantage, but others can learn.- she will not help players once she is wiz.- im glad the air is clearing in this mud.Galadriel.**hi... i am quite a new wiz, however, i know helenette for a long time.i read all your messages and your reasons and i must say, that i amagainst to idea of making helenette to a wiz.the reasons: a) as far as i know, she cannot program, at least not even C.b) she just keeps running around with a lot of stuff, more than youwill ever need -> she did not cought the idea of the mud, or is itthe idea to collect as many items as possible?c) when giving her a lot of additional options, like a wiz has,she can cause more damage and can help more players than before.when talking about rules, you have as wiz, who wants to look after her?i dont!!!d) being a wiz needs some sort of trust, otherwise you cannot be sure, what happens in the mud.e) i dont trust helenette, and i dont want to control her, everybody should dowhat he wants to...so she should not get wiz....fin**    All this has got me baffled....      Wotz all the fuss...if a Character makes it all the way to level 29      Then that Character(Notice i refer to character and not person, Both are DIFFERENT!)   deserves to Be a Wiz.     And who cares if She don't know C, I bet EVERYONE who started out      programming didnt know C straight off..I know i didnt.      I'm finding it quite hard to write right now cause      Galadriel and Tinkerbel r in the same room doing odd things ;)   You have to be here to understand..(*moan, breathe, lick, suck Etc*)   Anywayz......Thatz about all i can concentrate on right now ;)   And i vote YES YES YES! *RAZZ*        ----------------------------------------------------------------      ASK NOT WOT THE MUD CAN DO FOR YOU, BUT WOT YOU CAN DO FOR YODA!   ----------------------------------------------------------------**Yes for the hell of itYours Sherman.**After reading all the other notes concerning this argument, I'm finding itincreasingly difficult to believe that this is s seriously being put to the vote. The arguments presented against Helenette are, at best, feeble andpersonal, and at worst, are ill-mannered and ridiculous. "She smells"?!?Also, how can anyone complain that she can't programme? The entire premiseof 'mud' is to have fun and enjoy one's self, so an advanced degree incomputer operation and programming should not be required, or demanded ofthose not favoured by the powers that be. Patty, aren't you embarresed by what you put in your note? "She collects toomany items"... How on earth can you expect us to take you seriously if youinsist on petty comments and inuendo? The 'idea' of the mud is to wiz, andany foolish notion about Helenette not grasping that is to be treated withcontempt. Also, we are not really interested in your, or anyone's, personalopinion of any player, and I feel Dago is correct when he say's 'that's noreal argument' , so please, keep to the subject at hand?The only argument worth consideration is that a Wizard is expected to actand treat all other players/wizzes in a certain way, and it may be in doubtas to how Helenette will act when she obtains her 31st level. Not knowingher from before, I can not comment on this, and neither can any other, in lhonesty. It should be left to be seen, not pre-judged by those unqualified.Perhaps division among the wizhood would add some extra spice to our lives,that certain 'something' that prevails at player level, which is lost asone gains omnipotence. A thought to ponder?-Harley Davidson**Ok, yes would say enough but here are a couple of comments.1) I'm prejudiced in this vote, because I know her personally and like her.2) She can code a little and is willing to learn more about coding.3) She might help players while being wizard, but I think she won't.4) Have a nice time, and giveeveryone a fair chance.5) No reactions on previous notes (still, I read them)**I know her in RL, and I think she is nice.Besides, I happen to know that she is Arch on another mud,so who says she can't code? She must be rather good, to be arch.It will benefit all of us on this mud, I think.Bonzo..**He voted 'YES, let her wiz'.As U know, I organised a mail-vote, in which hevoted, just before he went on holiday.Bonzo.**I don't like voting but this is my vote.No explaining of why or why not.          Greetings Tinkerbel.**I must agree that Helenette is Vize Arch in Nightfall.But she cannot code LPC anyways (the guys went mad inNightfall to elect her!!!). And she does not write anyreal interesting thing there.I do not like parasites in this game and people who wantto become wizard for personal reasons. I wonder what goodthings would come out if we make her wizard.My vote is definitely NO, although I like her in RL. Butit has no use to make her wizard here.And btw: I dont like the idea that we get a new (even if notvery mighty) wizard who helps players all around the clock.   Klorathy**why notsheas done the questsshe'll not be able to help players w/out bein bustedwhen she is a wiz (u can banish her if she does if shes a wiz)and even if she can't wiz with helenette what's ta stop herfrom giving out all the quest info to a char and they wizand she uses their char? (just hadda throw a wily haired thought)Deadman**I vote yes, because Bonzo, one of my friends (hi Bonzo) votedyes. I trust his judgement :)**Just about all of the active wizards have voted on this topic, can a decisionnow be reached?-Silas**Yeah Silas.I make the result 20 - 6 in favour of Helenette making wiz.This is a 77% vote in favour (calculating in my head.)I think that says it all ....                        [*Moonchild*]**No, all i've got to sayKelly**"
