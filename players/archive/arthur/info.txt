This area is brought to you by Arthur, a few things to note, 
1) The quest, and the adventuring area's are diffrent, however,
this is not known to the player.
2) This quest should be solveable by any player, either high, or low.
It will actually be easyer for a level 1 to about 20 player than
a lvl 21- because the monster's were created to be exactly like their
attacker, except armour, and ac.
