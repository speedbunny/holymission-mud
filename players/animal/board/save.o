tmp_text "Animal, could you look at my proposal (following this note)?I would like to know if building this would be permissable before I investloads of time building it... =)Thanks,Milamber**### Apartment Building Proposal ### ### by Milamber @ GhostMud      ### ### September 12, 1991          ###  * each apartment room's code is contained in a prototype   room; each room is simply a copy of the prototype object    which is loaded and configured by the apartment office    (which should be autoloaded by the game)  * apartments will be dynamically registered to users within   a size restriction; only a certain number of floors will   be open at any one time, so there will always be a limited   number of apartments, even with expansion  * when someone rents the apartment, it is 'registered' in a   central file with a listing for each owned room; the only   data saved in the central file will be the location of the   room in a grid coordinate system, which will serve as the   id needed for the room to load its configuration file  * a certain fee (5000gc?) is required every month (game-   time) for continued occupance of the room  * the owner shall have a one-month grace period, after which   they are evicted and their apartment reverts to its   previous state; the owner must pay for every month,   including the grace period (if they get one month behind,   they will stay that way until they pay or are evicted)  * the prototype code allows:     - owner control of the room's appearance and the door      nameplate     - certain objects to be permanent room fixtures (eg,      telephone [see note below], television, etc.)     - keyed entry via a numeric keypad (owner-selectable)      with a 'ring' button (for doorbell) and a 'command'      button ("#"); the room will have a facade with the lock      mechanism targeted from the hallway to the room)     - suggestions (via mail or the suggestion box in the      apartment super's office) or necessary changes to be      implemented (just change the prototype)  ------------------------------------------------------------  Suggested file structure (in ~milamber/apt): ./database	room list (with owners and access codes) ./ptp_room.c	prototype room (loaded by hallway) ./rooms/???	each room's saved configuration ./ptp_hall.c	prototype hallway (loaded by office) ./ptp_stair.c	prototype stairwell (loaded by office) ./*.c		assorted other rooms (office,foyer,etc)  All rooms, halls, stairs, and access routes will be configured according to grid coordinates.  Rooms will be loaded by the reset() functions of the hallway portions to which they connect.  Possible future expansions: * telephone system throughout apartment building, access for   a fee? (telephones to be sold at a shop and kept in the   room until eviction) * elevator system  ------------------------------------------------------------  Code description:  Each room, when loaded, will be moved to the hall in which they connect as in a facade.  However, each room is its own facade.  When a player enters the room, the room moves the player to the room object from the hall object, and vice-versa for exiting.  The configuration for each room will be set initially by the office upon creation and will be saved and restored to a unique file.  The office (which, again, should be autoloading) will clone the hallways and stairs to a specified building height and configure each according to grid position, ie. a coordinate like (floor,num).  Each of the hallways in turn will, when initially reset(), will load any rooms that are targeted to that hall section according to room grid position, ie. (floor,hall_num,room_select) where room_select indicates which room (which side of the hallway, in other words).  <Current end of proposal>**Somehow, I have ended up with all of Afa's commands in my box.  i havenew'd it several times.  I even trashed it and got a new one.  Could youlook into it?  I think I am going to remove all teh commands and start over.Oh well.  <shrug>JBB**"
