        OK, it is time to TRASH those pieces of SH*T quicktypers
        that I know you all love so much (sarcasm)
 
        I now sell (NOTE: SELL) a device called the black box.
        It has SOOOOO many features that I can only list a few!
 
        It does macros, VERY well, and fast.... just type in a
        cmd followed by a ; and then another cmd followed by a ; etc etc...
        EXAMPLE:    'w; e; w; s; e; up; drink beer; fart' (will run all cmds)
 
        It has a nickname feature, typing in LONG or HARD to spell
        words is NOT the case with the box! Ex. nickname mav=maverick
 
        And of course it does EVERYTHING the old quicktyper does (BETTER)
 
        It will NEVER forget your cmds or nicknames either....
        If you lose it in a crash (god forbid) just get a new one
        and the cmds will be there.  NOTE: Once you buy, you NEVER
        have to buy it again, just goto the magic store and type
        in 'new' to get a replacement.
 
        If it EVER screws up, type in 'new' NO MATTER where you are,
        and it will FIX itself, and of course not forget anything.
 
        In other words it is NICE!!!!! (buy it, you WILL love it)
