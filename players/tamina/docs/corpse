SET&QUERY - corpse.c

Usual defined LFUN's:
set_weight(i), set_name(s), query_weight().

set_race(s): This sets the race of the corpse. One can assume the race of a
             corpse is the race of the killed monster, but this can be changed
             using this function.
             Example: set_race("undead");
query_race(): This function is needed to retrieve the race of the corpse. This
              can be used when you try to prepare one for dinner. One can
              also check if it's a dragon, ect.
