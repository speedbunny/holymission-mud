                         NOT ANOTHER LIST?!?!?!?!!!
               (It's a list thing. It's bigger than all of us.)
           A list of featured players on the Internet, compiled with
            the help of Auggie BBS (bbs.augsburg.edu) and dozens of
                             brave net riders.

4................ FTP sites
5................ Other services and tips
   This is a list of services that are available on the Internet, a
network that has grown exponentially in just a few months.  The Internet,
according to some reports, has become the largest online service on
the planet.  Companies like Microsoft, IBM and Apple are now taking
notice at something we've seen all along, and we are beginning to
see the commercialization of the Internet come into full effect.
New to this list are the addresses of software and hardware
companies who are now connected.
   Mind you, I haven't lost focus of the reason this list is in
existence: RECREATION. :)

FREE BULLETIN BOARD SERVICES
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
NOTE: I have placed BBSs whose main goal is to entertain or serve as
a forum for people to get together here.
BBSs whose primary purpose is connectivity or services involving the INet
have been placed in 'Other Services and Tips'.
 
\\\EBBS/PIRATE BBS///
Friendlier than it sounds.
Takes advantage of VT100 and up with a full-screen environment.
All offer Boards (message areas), Mail, and Talk.
Some offer Files and IRC connections.
One minor problem: The majority of these BBSes are limited to
only 800 or so users at any given time.
 
Auggie BBS

\\\CITADEL///
Citadel is a message-only system.
Boards using this are highly active with the exchange of messages
in various "rooms", sometimes as varied as MST3K>, NetLife>, and
Spam! Spam! Spam!>. Plenty of information can be had on these boards,
though no files are available.
Another feature of these boards is that each one has added a little
flavor to the stock Citadel code, so none of them are quite the same.
 
Quartz BBS
quartz.rutgers.edu
128.6.60.6
bbs
The granddaddy. Interesting and spontaneous conversation found at any
hour of the day or night. On the other hand, there are only 10 users
allowed at any one time.
 
Prism BBS
bbs.fdu.edu
132.238.2.10
bbs
This one is based on 'floors'. ALso very hard to get into on a regular
basis.

No files can be had on these, either.
 
ISCA BBS
bbs.isca.uiowa.edu
128.255.200.69 <-Note new IP address!
The biggest BBS on the net. Period. 15,000 users a day are calling ISCA.
User #100,000 should be logging in by December.
This BBS is literally six times as large as the first time I reviewed it.
During periods of heavy use, expect to wait in a queue just to get in.

192.41.245.143

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
FREENETS AND PUBLIC ACCESS UNIX
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Freenets are fairly new to the Internet.
These services often have Telnet, full email, USA Today news and
weather, and are typically set up like 'cities'. Registration is (as the
name implies) free, but usually require a snail-mailed form.
In much the same idea, a few boards have been set up for the public to use
UNIX at no cost.

FTP SITES!
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
 
For those of you who don't know how to FTP:
The command is like this:
To FTP Project Gutenberg...
ftp mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu
Once you are prompted for a login, do this:
On a UNIX, type anonymous.
On a VAX, type login anonymous.
Your password is your email address. It's a courtesy to the FTP server
to do this. Get used to it or make a macro.
List the contents of directories by hitting 'ls' or 'dir'.
If you use 'dir', you can tell which are directories by looking at the
far left. If the first letter at the far left is a d, it's a directory.
Otherwise, it's a file.
Change directories by hitting 'cd directoryname', where
directoryname is the name of the directory.
To get a non-text file (.ZIP, .Z, .sea, .LHA, .tar...), type bin before
the next step.
To get a file from the server to your account, type get filename.
Sometimes it takes a while. That's life.
Getting it from your account to your computer is someone else's problem.
:)
 
ftp mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu
Project Gutenberg. The project is trying to distribute 1 trillion
volumes within a decade. Dozens of books have already been translated
into plain-vanilla text. Files are in /pub/etext.
 
ftp world.std.com
Online Book Initiative in /obi. Another very big site for text files.
All sorts of classic books and information.
Also, the Online Bookstore in /OBS. This will soon become a commercial
service where you pay for new books in plain-text form.
 
ftp wiretap.spies.com
Just look around. It's pretty self-explanatory.
 
ftp ftp.eff.org
The Electronic Frontiers Foundation site. Lots of text files on the
organization and legal questions about cyberspace.
 
ftp sound.usach.cl
A buncha sound files, cross-platform.
 
ftp ftp.microsoft.com
Home of the MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up (peropsys/msdos/msdos6.2/stepup.exe), as
well as documentation on several Microsoft products.
 
ftp software.watson.ibm.com
Much the same as Microsoft's, but aiming more at OS/2.
 
ftp ftp.apple.com
Mac and A/UX stuff.
 
ftp ftp.novell.com
