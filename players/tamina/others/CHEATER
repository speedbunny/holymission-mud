This is a README file that contains crucial information/solutions for the
Holy_Grail quest coded by Elemental Tamina.

The Quest is essentially in 3-4 parts.


-=- Camelot -=-
----------------

In the castle, the players must find four keys that will ensure their
safety on the Elemental Planes, where the Darkling Lord (and the H.G.)
can be found.

Plane	Item	Where in Camelot	File
------	------	-----------------	------
Fire	Ruby	In shelves in: 		/p/t/castle/rooms
		[nw_tower3] - guarded by Morgan le Fey

Air	Necklace Jewelry		/p/t/castle/rooms
		 [wbed2]

Water	Pipe	Sir Mordred		/p/t/castle/monsters
		[wandering around camelot]

Earth	Diamond Shadow Demon		/p/t/castle/monsters
        Ring	[passage2] 

*
* It is also possible to alternate these items throughout the layout of
* the castle, varying it by changing some small parts of code, thereby
* not making this part of the quest too easy to relate to others.
*

Without these items, the player who tries to gain access to the Plane in
question is severely harmed by exposure to an alien-environment, and is
automatically returned to the Mortal Plane.

In order to get these items, you have to kill the monster guarding them:

Ruby,  is on Morgan le Fey - high level sorceress, with lots of 
----   spells to cast.  There is a slaying weapon against her
       This wand can be found from Merlin the Wizard, who is in
       seclusion in a maze under the castle.  The wand will be
       given to a player who succeeds in returning a whistle to
       Merlin which is located in the maze.

Ring  is guarded by the fearsome Shadow Demon, who has been reduced in
----- power, since it is by brute strength alone that the player must 
      kill this monster.

Necklace is hidden amongst some old, faded jewelry in one of the 
-------- bedrooms in one of the wings of the castle.

Pipe is held by Sir Mordred, who wanders around the castle.  He is well-
---- equipped, and a fierce warrior.  So is not an easy target.


  -=- Elemental Planes -=-
------------------------------

Once the player has succeeded in gaining access to the Planes, he then
can wander around, and wander out aimlessly, or find another 3 items, 
which when forged together in the Forge of Time (situated on the Plane
of Earth), the player makes a Blade which is slaying to the Darkling 
Lord.  Whether this will be Excalibur or not, I do not know.  I will 
decide this later.  Any opinions?

Plane	Item		Where in the Plane	File
------	------		--------------------	------
Fire	An Everlasting 	In the Minaret, guarded	/p/t/castle/planes/fire
	    Flame	by a Darkling Prince
	   [blade]

Air	Enwrapping	
	  Cloud		
	  [hilt]

Water	Breath of	
	  Life		
	[imbues life]

Earth  	The Forge of
