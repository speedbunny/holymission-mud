
Camelot:  The abandoned castle of the great King Arthur
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is my proposal for my area, and/or quest.

The famous court at the castle of Camelot is in turmoil.  The Holy relic,
the Holy Grail, has been stolen by some malignant force, which no one can
identify.  To add to this woe, the Valiant Sir Galahad has not returned
since his venturing to retrieve that which he paid so dearly to find.

Arthur, in a customary moment of pride, vowed to find his Knight, and 
return the Grail, even if it were the last thing he would do.  He also 
suspected that his dark step-sister, Morgan La Fey was involved in some 
way.  She was always known to covet Arthur and his power, and would 
herself stop at nothing to destroy him.

However, Arthur has not returned either, nor any of his entourage.  No 
word or messanger has been received, no replies can be sent...  Queen 
Guinever has grownincreasingly worried, and eventually called on the old 
mad-man, Merlin, Arthur's trusted advisor.  Merlin used his mystical 
powers and discovered that Arthur had indeed traced Galahad into the 
dreaded realm of the Elemental Planes, where the most unknown dangers lay.
There, Arthur was unfortunately stranded, and ambushed by the forces 
of the Darkling Lord himself!  That was all that Merlin has been able to 
preceive...

Soon afterwards, the exiled sorceress Morgan decided to take her chance 
while Arthur was detained elsewhere.  She raided the castle with her own 
forces, easily taking possession of the mystical seat of King Arthur's 
power.  This sent Guinever, and the other good folk of the palace, into 
hiding.  She then use the castle for her own vile rituals.  In these, she 
called on her ally, the Darkling Lord, to fulfil his part of their bargain, 
and dispatch Arthur once and for all.

/*
 * Morgan in fact has aided the Darkling Lord in this fould plot, and was
 * able to secure the disappearance of the Grail with ease.
 * In return for giving the Darkling Lord the control of the known world, 
 * as well as the Elemental Planes, Morgan was allowed to remain in 
 * Camelot, as her domain.
 */

Now Camelot has long been deserted, with the normal inhabitants chased 
out long ago by Morgan and her minions.  It is widely known that Morgan
holds Camelot, and that Arthur is now missing, suspected dead.
Who can save the Land from such a predicament, find Arthur, Galahad, and 
the Grail and release the fair Camelot from the evil clutches of the
dreaded Morgan?

This area would be ideally attached to the end of Ted's area, where he 
has started on and Arthurian-legend based area.  My area is centred 
around a castle, which can be called Camelot in disrepair, which is 
appropriate for 2 reasons:
1) Ted had left his area in this condition for so long, that any castle 
   would be in serious disrepair; and
2) Arthur has been gone from the Castle so long looking for Galahad and the 
   Grail, that Morgan was able to move in.

Within the Castle itself, Morgana has been able to set up gates to the 4 
Planes of the Elements, Water, Fire, Air, and Earth.  These the Darkling 
Lord controls.  He has told Morgan of a way how mortals can venture onto 
the Planes, without dying instantly, due to radical change in environment.
He has given her certain items for these purposes.  Without them, life on 
the Planes would be extremely nasty...viz.
Water -- A Pipe
Fire  -- A Ruby
Air   -- A Necklace
Earth -- A Diamond Ring

Therefore, there is a possible quest of saving Arthur, Galahad and the
Holy Grail, as well as the general completion of Ted's area, and the 
launch of a new area.

If you have any comments, or ideas, or suggestions, then please do not 
hesitate to contact me in some way.

Thanks for reading this..
