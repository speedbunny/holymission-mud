Howdy!
Sorry I haven't been on, by I have been very busy.  I also no longer have the 
luxury of having a computer in my room or even in my dormSuch is life, I guess.  I'm sorry to have missed you at the end of last year,
but I left rather unexpectedly.  I will probably be on no more than once or twice
a week, but hopefully we will meet up.  Until then, I am
                                     Your loving Condor

Hehe, thanks.  That one isnt going into the game.  I really
havent started coding as of yet.  Im just making any and all
tools for myself that I think are usefull.  I have a cloak
that changes ac, if you would like that, its in /pl/bl/general/
I figure Im gonna make a whole bunch of stuff to go with the
cloak and dagger, so if you want a copy of the final product, 
tell me.  Thanks alot for helping out with the dagger...
