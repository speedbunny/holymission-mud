Subj: Ted's Area

Hiya Uglymouth !
I think that my revision of Ted's area is complete.
I've done it in such a way that it is completely within my /dir - to be
found at: /players/tamina/teds/*.*
For you to change over the files, all you need to do is change the code
of one file -> /room/deep_forest1.c (i think), to include permanently the
front of the castle ("/players/tamina/teds/castle.c").
Also, i think it might be wise to either delete ted's files, or archive 
themin some way - i don't know if that is possible - but the castle and
cariage might cause confusion if they suddenly appear... ;-)

Anyway, being in my /dir, it will be easy for me to fix any bugs that do
appear, or change the code in any other way.

Feel free to check through before you decide to implement this and mail me
with any comments  :)
Thanks,
     Elemental Tamina

Subj: promotion

Date: Sep  7

Hi,

Even though I still do not have all results from Warlord and
Airborne, I think the area is good enough to be opened. So
I installed it north of /players/ted/path/black.c It is of now
open for players. Of course the promotion going with it has been
given to you too. Congrats! One request though: please remove
the board at the draw_bridge. This is supposed to be just another
part of the world. Not a point where another wizard's area starts
and glory can be gained through notes on a board. If you keep
contact with players, you will get a good impression of what they
think of your area. Thanks.
See you around,

Viking Lord Uglymouth
