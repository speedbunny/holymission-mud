ok we had a major problem today...someone screwed around
with the players soul and no one had souls...
Somehow someone got it fixed but when everyone logged back on, all
their stuff was gone..everything...Players are getting stuff back
but major stuff is hard to get, ninjas shuto and daitos...
So if they ask, ask them what happen before they get one back...
This really sucks

Subj: bug in helmuts death

Cc: airborne, tamina, helmut
Date: Oct 14

Helmut died and I checked it out..it was bugged..major style
The room is /players/tamina/castle/rooms/crypt
The monster is the giant scorpion and when you kill it, its tail is
suppost to fall off and become a weapon, well the tail falls off but
after it dies, it comes back to life at deaths door over and over
not letting you leave the room...This was the cause of Helmuts death.
Helmut lost a total of 750k in xp.
From what I saw and tested, he deserves it back...

Subj: Area

Date: Oct 18

Well I am supposed to consult my mentor about the area I want to make.
Right now here is my idea:
geared toward lvl 15-25
based on the Dragonlance books
possibly introduce religions of Paladine and Takisis
have draconians, coded right, not like the others, which do not follow the 
books
have dragons, possibly even fighting on dragonback??
good area for a quest
well these are prelim. ideas obviously, tell me what you think, ps when do plan on playing next, or when do you usually play?
