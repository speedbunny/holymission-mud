Hi,

Here are some remarks on your files. I only mentioned something the first time
I noticed it. I think you can find any other occurences yourself ;-)
I hope these remarks prove useful.         Uglymouth.

entrance: in rooms there's no need to have ::reset(arg); unless you use clone_list.
court_yard: don't put '.' in the descriptions of items. that's done automatically.
     (would result in double ..)
e_wing: tower exit in short_desc doesn't match enter exit in dest_dir
e_wing: no items({}). Too bad, for there's lots to look at.
wcorridor: typo in long_desc fould --> foul
    tapestires (tapestries?) in items({}) is never mentioned before.
store_room: typo long_desc uesless --> useless
General impression: Great area. I very much like the long_descs.

log date june 3rd 1994:
Don't use ::reset(arg); in rooms unless you are using replace_program().
Remind me to explain you about that efun _soon_. It's very useful.
I think filter_live is rather ugly code, but if you figured it out
yourself, you did good thinking. Use present efun instead though!
if(!ob=present("ghoul") && !living(ob)) clone & move ghoul;
barracks_d.c is bugged: syntax error in line 54.
ne_tower1: I like the idea for the long_desc, but of course it doesn't
hold true for people that walk downstairs...
store_room: seems like MAKE_KEY is ok now :-)
  but use transfer instead of move_object, to prevent weight bugs.
nw_tower: use switch instead of if() statements:
swritch(str) {
  case "table": write(); say();
  break;
  same for all others; break;
  default: write("You can't search there.\n");
   break;
}
also: out exit doesn't correspond to north exit that brings you here.
nw_towera: the msgout in move_player is incorrect. this msg always gets
  appended to '<name> leaves', so would be here: 'x leaves enters the...'
guards in nw_tower2: you can code both sword and monster in the room.
passage: long desc is only valid at first entrance. once you're in and just
look around you shouldn't get the SLAMM! To correct this, put the S
  the SLAMM! msg, that is, in a write() within the init() function.
passage2: just some code-technical remarks: you don't need a for loop if
   you only clone 1 object. also, the int i; could have been declared a
   local variable within the reset() function.
shadow demon: don't block individual guild abilities!! guild powers are
considered to be balanced (or will be soon). Doing this would put some guilds
in a disadvantageous position.
same goes for dust demon
reception: you have a layout problem here. when I try to map the area,
   the ne and nw exits overlap with ne_ and nw_towers. Maybe you should
   extend the e_ and w_wing a bit...
filter_live: it's buggy as well. doesn't work if there's a player in the
   room at the time or reset. Just use present efun.
juntion overlaps with both kitchen and ne_tower when mapping.
