new update, july 25 1994
throne_room long_desc is incorrect when I come from east here...
never use capitals in set_name of monsters! kill command won't work then.
   (Retainers in throne room, but check all your monsters on it, please).
pantry2 won't load... :-(
is long_desc and spell_msgs for darkling prince ok?
   (only \n's...)
file for nw exit in throne_room doesn't exist (guest_room).
ecourt2: clones skeletons only 1x per reboot! put has_cloned = 0; in
   the reset function. Also I think you should decrease num_skel by 1
   each time a skeletom is killed...
   and put if(num_skels == 4)... before the for-loop.
note skeleton sword: note that weight is related to wc (it's 4, not 3 ;).
well3 doesn't exist (north exit from well2).
Please be a bit careful with negative light factors. Remember that a lot of
   guilds don't support light abilities, and torches are rather scarce.
mole's hole crosses the well rooms (why so many empty lines in the roomcode?)
wcourt3 typo in long_desc oather --> another
***** New log starts here; date: july 29 1994.
ne_tower3: there's no search function, though there's an add_action for it.
I love the up/up/up, down/down/down messages, but you could have them both
   in the same room, instead of 2 rooms (ne_tower1 & 2). Put it in the init
   or something. After all, when you stand still and look, you don't see if
   whether you're moving up or down...
*** New log started 9-Aug-1994: ***
nw_tower3: search routine doesn't check if has been searched already.
   It is now possible to find unlimited rubies, keys, etc.
   Also the bl_key doesn't load because the file doesn't exist.
nw_tower1: priest is only cloned at first reset. because it isn't mentioned
   in the clone_list, it's forgotten the moment replace_program is called.
sacrificial knife: I think wc 18 is a bit high for a knife, considered
   that the max legal wc is 20...
iron maiden: in open function you need to check for if(opened) earlier.
   As it is now, you can always open the thing.
shadow_demon: I don't think it's fair to block only 2 guild powers.
   You are selectively making it harder for certain people, which is not
   the intention of the game. Also (not tested though) I suspect that it
   would also block death & assassin not directed to the demon.
LIGHT: Please think about this carefully. Some areas are so dark they will
   almost never be acceptible to guilds without infravision (even mage;'s
   lastlight will fail at light -3, let alone bards and fighters...).
   Negative lightlevels should only be used under extreme magical conditions,
   and even then not into the extreme.
dust_demon: same remark as goes for shadow_demon.
passage5: there can be any number of dust demons: a new one is cloned each
   time someone (re)enters the room, even if there is one already. It's ok
   to allow more demons, but limit the maximum number.
passage6: if(str < 17) always fails. This means that players with str < 17
   will be trapped in the passages forever... is this your intention?
passage6 and bedroom do not even lie close to each other if you map the
   area, even if not all scales would be equal. Thus it's not logical that
   these rooms would be separated by just a singly thin wall...
