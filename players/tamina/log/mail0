I really like you.  You seem wicked nice and fun to go out places with.
I like talking with you.  Don't worry I won't tell Scott anything.
You have an awesome personality and I hope we can keep in touch in the
future.  I'll give you my adress so if you want to write you can.  I
would like to get your adress also if it's possible.

Love
