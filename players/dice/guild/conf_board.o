Meaning he's got four asses.\n(And now for something completely different: A man with three buttocks)\n\n(Actually this is just the result of a sugar high revisited. I overdosed\non m&m's and Easter candy last night... and yes, this is my first time in\nthe guild room.) =)\n\n\n**\nHello, and welcome back to the top news story of the evening.  Our top story\nis of a top news story becoming a top news story that wasnt a top news story\nbefore it became a top news story.  Wait a second...(Throws sheet out the \nwindow)  Ok here we go...The top news story for tonight is the exclusice death\nof a man a paper cut that just happen moments ago when someone throw a paper\nout of a window and it sliced the man throat.  We have top information on the\npaper and the paper reads...Tonight top news story is about how a news story\nbecomes a top news story....Wait a second?\nThis is crazy and I'm out of here....This whole script is screwy....\nStupidist thing I have every read...\nWell, what do you expect out a the ninja guild?\n(Leaves)\n\n(Little old man with a long beard comes on....)\nIT'S!\n\n\n**\nOkay kiddies. Story time. (don't you dare call me Grandma Sushi ...the\nLoremaster is tellin this story so siddown and shaddup or you're\nall going to be turned into SHEEP... and you know how Silas\nloooooooves sheep.... *smirk*\nSo.... once there was this chick from a small college - an art student -\nand she's just come back in from her usual haunts, exhausted from too\nmuch homework, too much computers,and no sex for some reason...\nShe's doing her FRENCH homework and the girl from down the hall, known\nas J, stops in, asking if she has scissors to trim a rose stem for her.\nNow.... J has a notorius rep for being inconsiderate....\nIn fact, on their first meeting, J invites the art chick into her room with Sta, another hallmate.\nThe art student has a very chilled can of soda from her window ledge since\nshe's too poor to afford an icebox. J spies yonder soda, asks if she may\nopen said can, and the art student is kind enough to share. Said art\nstudent gets that can back HALF GONE. She wipes the can off, takes a few sips...\nJ asks for more. The art student just did not learn her lesson the first\ntime, gives J the can, and gets it back EMPTY. After a while, the trio\norders Chinese food from a place that delivers (J leeches money off of\nSta) and followingthis, J and Sta light up for a smoke when Sta knows full\nwell that this art student does NOT smoke and does not like it when people\nsmoke near her. The art student gets up, makes an excuse to do laundry, and\nexits the room for 20 minutes, returning after the room no longer looks like\na cloud landed in theplace.\nNow J asks, after the rose gets trimmed if she can hang. Hoping J will not\nbe long, the art student allows her in. Right off, J asks for a drink. Art\nstudent-chick goes and makes a FULL mug for the pig. J takes a sip of her\niced tea, and LEAVES it. Then she asks for \"munchies\", which art-chick\nsays are in very limited supply (lies, says she does not have any)...\nBy this point, J is scoping out the room.\n\tJ starts to open art-chick's art supply box (like a toolbox) and THEN\nasks if it's ok. Art chick says ok, figuring J will be BORED. Instead, J \npicks up the most expensive items... including tubes of paint, which she\n_proceeds_to_open_ saying \"I wonder what color this makes\" - Art chick \nquietlky reprimands J, asking her to leave the paint alone. J then asks if\nart chick has any cash to loan her for dinner at the main cafeteria, which \nthinks cheap food can have high prices... Art-chick says she blew all her\ncash from that weekend on a trip to a dance club in the city (another \nwonderful story...*sarcasm*) and J asks \"what about your meal card\"?\nart-chick refuses, so J goes back to her room, picks up the phone, and says\n\"Sta? Cash.\" and gets it. Now... J has screwed up art chicks old walkman, &\nart chick is officially BANISHING J from her room and any other fucking \nbitch/bastard who tries to sponge off her and go through her shit and \nbreak things. To this day, J still lives in the same dorm, and the tension\nrises.....      Coming soon to a theater near u.\n\n\n**\nif you are unable to clean spirit ( and have no hp/sp lines in your score)\ntype fix \nit's a bug that a few of us have gotten.....\nBTW sorry about posting a serious note *grin*\n\n\n**\nWhy has our guild been depowered? My critical hitting sorta sucks, to be\nhonest, I only do \"pound\" and an occasional \"bloody bodypart\" damage, no\ninsanes, like the good old days :(  \nHelp me out on this one, I ask, why?  Why, oh, why?  Was it necessary? \nOr has the hand of fate played a part in this unforunate event?\nWell, perhaps we will be all wiser when we are certain as to the methodology\nbehind the depowering, and can fully gain a new understanding of our ninja\nbretheren.\n\nNinja Ren\n\n\n**\nLodoss may have an interesting idea......\nit would make assassination a more fun skill to use and make it more\nrealistic. \nIt's something to consider.\n                    labarum the silly\n\n\n**\nso why not post the idea ?\n\n                 pat\n\n\n**\nit isn't that deadly as before\n\n                   pat\n@\n\n\n**\n\n**\n"
