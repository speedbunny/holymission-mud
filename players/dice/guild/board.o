tmp_text "My opionion: To get our best weapons(Katana and Wakizashi) is really too hard.But I think\nthats ok.If you want best weapon,you must fight.But If you died and you lost\nyour Wak. or Katana it is too much for me(us).So try to think what to do with it. I thin k if we died and concentrate on Susanoo, He could get us our lost weapon (Katana or Wakizashi).\n\n   Bye   \n      Susanoo\n\n\n**\nI would like to know whats the matter with darts. I didn't see them in the shop \nfor a long time.What the hell is it?.How we can use our poison ? \n* GRIN *\n\n **\n\n\n\n**\nMy suggestion is this:-\nIf you die and drop your wak as a result then your wak disappears, and the \nloss is registered. When you go to the jingu and concentrate on Susano-o,\nthen Susano-o gives your wakizashi/katana back to you. Also, as far as quests\ngo then maybe something a little more elegant than lockers. How about you\nhave to give your weapon to the Shogun while you do the quest (ie put it\ninto his care) However in that case I think it would be kinda neat if he won't\nreturn it till the quest is done (ie you say something about care, and he)\nasks what quest it is for, so you tell him, he accepts the wak and returns\nit to you if you go in there and say \"quest done\" and you have indeed \nfinished the quest) This means that you only lose the weapon from when you \nneed to lose it to the beginning of the quest. Of course it would require\na little maintenance from a wiz to make sure that any new quests where\nplayers do have to drop their weapons are noted so that the Shogun can \naccept for them. I don;t know how difficult this would be to code, but I'd\nbe happy to help any other wizzes who have more time to work on it.\n\nDazza\n\n\n**\nSome people play this mud just to hack and slash everything in sight.  But me,\nI use this mud as a cheap phone call to my girlfriend in real life (whenever\nshe is on) and a bit of roll playing - I get into the ninja character and my\nAxl character pretty well I think.  Yes, it would be a great idea to remove\nour weapons and place them into someone's care as we do a quest or something.\nA while back, I was talking to Exos about his samaurai guild and the possib-\nilities of little fueds between the two guilds - the honorable samaurai with\ntheir katana and wakizashi versus the stealthy ninja with our ninja-to.  Some\nof the ideas were they had objects lying around and we stole them and they\ncame back to retrieve them, etc. etc.  Takes away from the same old kill\nmonster, reset, kill monster, etc.  A bit of roll playing...what I am getting\nat is just because we give our weapon to our Shogun (a flaky dude that does\nnot say too much) does not mean we will automatically get them back.  Maybe\nthey were stolen or misplaced - here is an idea.  If a wizard would like to\npair up with me and maybe a few others, create a rival ninja clan to our east\nof the island - put their guild out in the water and a secret path that leads\nto them or something.  Have a bunch of multi-leveled ninja, su-jen, maybe even\nanother Shogun out there with our stolen weapon; meaning we would have to\nutilize other weapons, which we should be able to do already (along with a\nbunch more that can be coded for our purposes).  In a sense, we have no true\nrival guilds in this mud, so maybe we can have a NPC guild against us.  And\nmaybe if we take too long to retrieve our stolen weapons, they were sold off\ninto the Yakuza *grin*\n>>>>>Axlrose - just popping off some ideas off the top of his head<<<<<\n\n\n**\nI was thinking along just the same lines actually - scarey I know!\nNo more elboration for now - till I know a bit more\nabout the coding - I'm very much a newbie wiz at the mo\nBut you and I are thinking along same lines\n(autoloading weapons for game balnce should be a bastard)\nsorry to piss opn the other ninjas' bonfires but Axls idea\nis probably better for game balance\n\n\nDazza the drunk (but not stoned for at least 2 more days ;))\n\n\n**\nDarts are usually in the guild shop (w w n) but there have been a lack of\nthem lately... i only could get 3 this afternoon when i was making poison\ndarts.... maybe it had something to do with the reboot being cancelled \nor maybe other ninja's had them.  \nOn a simular note to all ninja's please be considerate to the newbies\nespecially... sell all guild materials in the guild shop... don't sell\nthem around the mud.\nJust my opinions on things.... \n\tthe loving the revitalization of the guild\n                                  labarum\n\n\n**\nI don't know what's happening about darts - if any other wizzes have any idea\nplease let me know\n\nDazza\n\n\n**\nI overheard talk of changes to our guild.  I also saw something in one of these notes regarding them.  Could someone pots/mail me a list\nof these changes?\nTURBO\n\n\n**\nhi\nGambit told me when he dies he looses the katana and the wakazashi.\nThis was because there was an old problem, that an autoload object\nwhich is dropable can be doubled by a clever player :*)\nbecause:\n1 step: auto_load() playerfile\n2 step: drop()\n... but before the drop comes the playerfile is saved so that from \ndroping the katana was still auto_load ... \n\nNow recoded that file so that you get the katana after death, its still autoload and you can\ndrop and get it , which the old idea was :)\n\n         So thanks to Gambit which told me that problem :)\n\n                    whisky the Gnome\n\n\n**\no.k. i have been lost on this subject from the start\ni was told all you had to do was put the blood into the egg\nand it would work.  Guess what? it don't work.\nhow does the egg/poison making process start/middle/end?\n\t\t\tconfused,\n\t\t\t\tDF\n\n\n**\nSay egg to shogun - he'll fill you in\n\nDazza\n\n\n**\nincreased the damage of assassinate, so that it is a feature again and\nnot such a punny thing it'd been lately.\n\nthe change to hit with assassinate depends on yer skill, the damage ye\ndo on yer dex (so get yer dex up ! *grin*)\n\nenjoy it\n\n                                Pat, the evil bat (pet)\n\n\n**\nJust one question: Is the new assasination as deadly as before?(For monster and for u us)\n\nThanks :-)\n\n\n\n**\ncheck it out\n\n                 pat\n\n\n**\n1)WELCOME TO THE BEST GUILD IN THE GAME\n2)read all help files before you try to do anything it will solve most questions\n3)Weapons: use only ninja weapons it's better for your character in the long run\n4)don't sell ninja stuff outside the guild\n5)read help weapon file to find out what you can and can not wield.\n6) have fun and good luck\n\n\n**\n\n**\n"
