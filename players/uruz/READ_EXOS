Exos, ok I've got my first area all planned out. It's basically a village.
	It's an eastern setting. It the fief of Daimyo Tokugawa Ieyasu. I
	do't know if you know much about Japan's feudal history. Most of
	it is historically correct. I was planning on having it a high lvl
	area, but I noticed an extreme lack of newbie areas lately. It
	can be either, just let me know what you think before I start
	coding the mobs for it. I'll try to make a rough map here for you.

key:
	P= basic path through village
	R= rice fields
	R= river (an underwater section containing 13 rooms)
	B= sushi bar (minor healing)
	X= massage parlor (average to good healing)
	M= peasant village (about 5 rooms)
	A= alleys
	D= Hwarang-Do Karate School (8 rooms, buncha karate guys)
	S= shop
	H= gambling hall(and backroom with opium dealers)
	T= temple (a 2 floor 28 room small castle with assorted rooms, it
		has a whole buncha servants, guards, and Daimyo Tokugawa)

	And that's the general gist. It was originally my intent to code
	three fief area, and then code them to be at war with each other		at random times. I was hoping to try and take over the sumoners
	guild as soon as I could, in which case the I wouldn't bother
	with the other warring fiefs. Let me know whatcha think.
