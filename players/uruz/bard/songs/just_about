		Just About 'The Only' Blues (by Lowest of the Low)

Let's take a walk down to 'the Only'
And drink until our kidneys fail
And you can tell me that you want me
And I can think about betrayal
And you can leave me thinking, drinking all night
'cause that's the sharpest nail

And I don't know if I'm comin'
And I don't know if I'm goin'
And I don't know where I'm stayin'.....tonight

Let's get a table by the window
Beneath the shot of Chairman Mao
And I can tell you all my problems
And you can try and hold'em down
This seems a trivial pursuit now
But it's the only game in town

And I don't know if I'm comin'
And I don't know if I'm goin'
And I don't know where I'm stayin'.....tonight

You won't talk about it
But I know there's something wrong
And though I ain't done nothing
I know that's what I've done wrong
'Cause something really sucks.....tonight

There's a letter I can't open
And there's a song that I can't write
And there's a book that I can't put down
Here comes another sleepless night
And sure I'd like to work it all out
But I guess I'm not that bright

And I don't know if I'm comin'
And I don't know if I'm goin'
And I don't know where I'm stayin.....tonight
