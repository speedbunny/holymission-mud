                      -= The Healing of Time =-

    The Omni can convert its stored timepoints, into hit points or
spell points.  But it will take a certain number of timepoints to get
1 spell point or hit point.  You just type in the number of spell points
or hit points, you want to be healed and the Omni itself will convert
the needed timepoints.
