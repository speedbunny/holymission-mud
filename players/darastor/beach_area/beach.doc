My area is an area set round a small beach. Initially it is just going to be a smugglers' hideout in a cave off the beach. However, I have several plans for expansion once the first part of the area is complete. These are as follows:

The first is that exploring the cave reveals a secret entrance from which players can swim to a pirate ship, which will be a second small area.

From here the players will find a rowing boat, which they can (if careful) row to an island in the sea. I have not yet decided on much about this island since I don't expect to be coding it for quite a while.

I also intend to site a miniquest-type scenario in the area.  This will probably be based on finding something that has been stolen from the smugglers by the pirates aboard the vessel. The reward for the quest will not be quest points but will be money and/or experience. Of course it will be subject to standard quest things - namely that one can only benefit from it once.

Other "points of interest"
(1) If a player swims in the sea in the wrong place (he/she should be warned off by the desc of the sea) then he/she gets dragged under the sea and washed up in one of several places, back on my beach, Ezo, Whisky’s island, Crescent Lake, the jetty, Uglymouth’s beach, the sea in the Lakmir quest or the coast road.

(2) There is a poisoned pool of water in the area. If a player drinks from it he/she will be poisoned. Again, there will be a veiled warning in the description of the pool/water. This poison is about the same strength as a single stonefish fang.
