Barbarians, naturally, can't wear armours made out of chainmail or 
plate but prefer the steel and fur for their protection. Barbarians tend
to be more at home wielding a club, axe or a sword. Experienced barbarians 
tend to be faster in combat than normal warriors, and can often manage 
to get in two or three blows where a normal warrior would only manage
one.

In addition to the standard stats, Barbarians have five additional skills,
combat, melee, toughness, fortitude and speed. It's up to you to find out 
what they do. Barbarians stand very close to their gods. They always try 
to live up to their gods beliefs. Thus you will need to maintain and 
conquore for your god and for which they stands.
