To start a wedding you need to have a wizard present.
The wizard should type 'marry <player1> and <player2>'.
From then on the service is fairly self-evident.
Don't speak up during the service, the Barbarian Chief might think
that you have a reason to stop it !
A wedding costs 6000 coins - this cannot be paid for by a wizard.
For a list of all performed weddings, type "weddinglist".
Since this church was made in honour of the god Crom,
weddings are only possible if both players are followers of him.
To become a follower of Crom, you must pray to him in the Barbarian
Church and sacrifice the sacred object to his soul.
Weddings can only be done between players who are old enough,
in level - 5th level or higher.
