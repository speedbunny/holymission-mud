notes ({"Good Day Bards.\nThings have changed drastically./\nby the End of April, the new bard soul will be up.\nI know you'll all like it.\nTo describe the changes:\nThe instruments are no more.\nA lot of NEAT abilites are added:\nBeggar: Great to use when you are low on gold\nSongbird: A nice tell power...(suggested by Zavien)\nStrum Lute: Calms the clouded minds\n(reminds me no more brooch, your bard soul is now a lute)\nDetail: Updated and improved\nLocate Taliesin: You asked for it...you get it. (suggested by ALL)\nVoice: Learn to throw your voice...amuse your friends...\n>\nSome deletions:\nchangelook: currently absent\nInstruments: removed\nMake: removed\nRestore: removed\n>\n","A few more abilities:\nPretitle: As good as ever\nTitle: hehe you know it you love it\nMaybe: Direct Exos line :)\nBard: You'll love the new bard line\nSing: Still being reworked.\nSongs: Need NEW songs!\n>\nIn place of instruments, there are now bard spells\nCheck them out:\nUtter Chaos: Confuses EVERYONE in room (Legend ability)\nConfusion: Causes monsters to do funky things\nEnchant Weapon: Boost your weapon's performance\nIrresistable Dance: A monster can't defend well while dancing...\nLullaby: Sometimes its best to put your foe to bed...\nPyrotechnics: A little sizzle pop boom...\nSilence: Help prevent your foe from casting spells\nQuiet: Prevents EVERYONE in room from casting (Legend Ability)\nSeduction: Nothing better than some seduction\nStarshine: Brightens up the room you are in permanently\nUncontrollable Laughter: Hard to hit someone while laughing....\nArmour of Ithan: Nice armour...\n",0,0,"Some new idea:\n                                                                                1., The drum and violin do a very little damage.\n     a., Increase the damage.\n     b., Some new instruments:\n          -tambourine    (drum for high level bards)\n          -cello         (violin for high level bards)\n                                                                                In case of b., a little change is need for the drum.\nTo use it you need a lot of sp.

Great theme for bards, isn't it?\n     There was a spell /named illusion/ for the mages.\n     I think that was very cool.\n     Or some little tricks:\n     Example a flower or an animal, etc.\n                                                                                5., The brooch:\n     I think it would be better, if the brooch showed you,\n     how many charges it contains.

That's very good.\n     But why can't I play a sad melody?\n                                                                                7., New play command:\n     -play <instrument> attribute\n      -other people's message: Bard is playing on <inst.> attr.\n     -play magic <inst.>\n      -You will use the magic of the instrument. /Like now/.\n     -rplay <inst.> <person> attr.\n      -You will play to one person on your instrument.\n                                                                                8., Pretitle, and shout:\n     Pretitle should be shown at shouting.\n","Ballot:\n                                                                                You can vote for my ideas.\nJust type simple 'yes' or 'no' below the number of the idea.\n/Hint on page 2./\n/Please, give your name too./\n/I just wnat to know, if all the bards voted./\nThanks:\n                        Loncarm\n                                                                                 1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     Your name\nyes   yes   yes   yes   yes   yes   yes   yes    Falcon Loryn\n","                                                                                            Winter best wishes\n                                                                                Winter, this wonderful season of sweet,\nWhich is the mother of all joy and peace,\nAnd the beautiful pearl of winter,\nFeast of merry Christmas,\nKeeps You in full of best,\nIn snow is up to Your knees, and falling into Your neck!\n                                                                                Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year to all of You!\n                                                                                                                        Loncarm Dak Regis\n","Hellllllllo bards.\nYes, I am OFFICIALLY the guild master of bards now.\nso here's an overview:\nwhole guild system is being revamped.\nso the new bards will be one of the first under the new system.\nlet my cover some of my ideas:\n#1 - Find Taliesin, good power, rather self-explanatory.\n#2 - Ventriloquism (It was recently ruled illegal when Blade\n     took the idea and put it into thief.  So I will have to make\n     it less abusable)\n#3 - Legend Levels (Yes you want em, you got em :)\n#4 - Utter Chaos (Effects all non-bards in room.  Random effects\n     ranging from cease fighting, walk away, paralyzation, or worse.\n     changes randomly each round.)\n#5 - Uncontrollable Laughter (effects one target.  Hard to fight\n     when you are laughing.  Sometimes they laugh so hard as to cause\n     internal damage :)\n#6 - Irresistable Dance (effects one target.  Dancing forces their AC\n     down, and also causes a temporary loss of strength and\n     constitution.  And some people have two left feet [like me :)]\n     so they stumble and hurt themselves once in a while :)\n#7 - Revamping the instruments.\n#8 - Waiting for YOUR suggestions.  POST them in the notebook, just\n     as friend Loncarm has told you on page 2\nYour loving Guildmaster,\nExos\n",0,0,0,0,"vanessa loves loncarm\n","AND WHO LOVES LORYN ?????\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"loncarm loves vanessa\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,"notebook\n",})
