Clowness Whisky tells you: the problem of the call_out("heal_slowly",120) in
the monster is , that the heal_slowly is called automatically and when the
monster isnt full on hp or sp everytime the heal_slowly is called in the
monster a new call_out("heal_slowly" of 120 is putted into the call_out row
what is sequentielly with the length of the call_outexecuted in the stack
machine what means with 40 players on and maybe 500 attacked monster you get a
log of lag *(
