                                                   /MOONCHILD/

 !! NEW FEATURE !!
 You now are able to protect your directories from being read by other
 wizards below arch-level !
 If you place a file names '.SECURE' in one of your dirs, this dir and
 all subdirs are protected.
 eg:
    if u want to protect '/players/test/private' you make a file named
    '/players/test/private/.SECURE'. Then this and all subdirectories
    are protected from being read.
 If you notice problems with that please inform Llort or the local
 police station!

NOTE!!!!   E-Mail Airborne at aw0991@rachel.albany.edu with your e-mail address
to allow communication of meeting schedule coming up soon.
