What we have here is, failure to communicate.
Some men you just can't reach...
so, you get what you have here last week
which is the way he wants it!
Well he gets it!
N' I don't like it anymore than you men...

Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before

Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before!

Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
THY way we've always done before

Look at the doubt we wallow
Look at the leaders we follow
Look at the lies we swallow
AND I don't want to hear no more!
