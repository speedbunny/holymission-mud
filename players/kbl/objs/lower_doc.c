/* Lower Demon of Chaos Level 10-15 monster 
   hit point range of (lvl*20)+random(50)+1   [random 50 is bonus for pure chaos]
   therefore low end 10th level DOC (Demon Of Chaos) could look like this:
   hp = 200 + (1 ... 50)

   spell point range will be better, they are closer to energy beings but not
   yet immortal.  They exist from the death of players. In A voidal realm, on
   a structure thats like a floating island in the void, orbiting a vortex
   that leads to room/void ... spell range formula: (lvl*18)+random(80)+1

   therefore spell range is sp = 180 + (1 ... 80) at 10th level.
