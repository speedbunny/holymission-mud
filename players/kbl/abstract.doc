My area is situated north of the Orc valley, off of a very deep portion
of Orc valley. Castle is on the side of a mountain range extending east to
west. Underneath the Castle of Kbl, through 3 seperate entrances, lies the
dungeon. Just before entering the Castle there's a path going east. Once
inside the "castle", you enter a minor hallway to the entrance chambers where
the doors are always open. Long rectangular table is here with functionality.
