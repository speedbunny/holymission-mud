tmp_text ":)**Hi All!Yes! The first PRO note! I think Tinkerbel should become wizard.He has been NEW long enough.Greetings,Ethereal Cashimor**Hi arches,Helenette hasn't misbehaved till now, and she has learned the rules byheart and is trying to code. I've checked on her, and she doesn't cheat(at least, I never saw her do it). I'm not saying we should make her wizardright away, but after Tinkerbel I think she should be the next.Greetings,Ethereal Cashimor**I agree with all the positive comments regarding Helenette that Cashimormade. In addition, she has been very helpful in picking up bugs in otherpeople's castles, and she was also the person who drew to my attention thecheating incident involving Ryu and Yoda.                                [*Moonchild*]**And in adittion to that, she has been helpful in pointingout things that aren't covered in the rules yet.On this que, I mad my proposal for other types of armour.I think things like that should be encouraged.Instead of abusing this gap in the rules to makewonderful armour, as I think lots of wiz's would,she suggested that I close that gap, as not manyother wiz's would.Bonzo.**demoted patience to level 30 ....Klorathy & Patience did play a trick on Bonzo.*growl***"
