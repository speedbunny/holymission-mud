tmp_text ":(**He has been caught cheating so many times.For fuck's sake don't ever promote the guy, banish him now!**He cheats a lot. He is a bit more subtle about it thanHarley, and can code a bit better, so slightly lessanti-him than with harley.**Hi All!My guildroom, Taliesin, logs everything that's said near him. In the logfileI read that 'Pirate Deadman' said something to anotherplayer concerningTed's quest. He was aware that this was illegal.Just to mention it, I don't know if it's hard enough to nail him, but waita few minutes before promoting him.Bye,Ethereal Cashimor**Hi All!Cashimor seems not to be able to handle the resposibility of being anarchwizard. He has been assigned to maintain the consistency in thisMUD, but has failed utterly. I hope you will degrade him as soon aspossible.Ethereal Cashimor**Hi arches,Harley is TERRIBLE. He keeps asking every wizard around to program somethingfor him, he talked me into marrying him, and he says to other wizards: Herpand Cashimor agreed, so you can do it without problems. Please keep himApprentice till he stops (and two more weeks to be sure).Greetings,Ethereal Cashimor**Hi Arches!Yoda wants to open his castle on this MUD, but it is in a very bad state.1) Most of the sources are programmed by other wizards, or directly   stolen.2) The files he wrote himself are standard file.3) He looked up when I complained about the facts that:   1) You couldn't 'exa castle' or 'exa hallway' (He said he had never done      such a stupid thing being player)   2) You couldn't READ the sign at the entrance (He      said he didn't know how to do it)   3) I complained about the sounds being there even when the monsters are      dead.I suggest we keep him a newwiz until he knows what call_out means, andtell_room (he didn't know either of them).Maybe a degradation to APPR would be in place.Greetings,Ethereal Cashimor**I personally think Deadman is a complete Dork.He posts notes about wizard actions on his guild board instead of in the wiz flame board.And comments like 'watching the mud go swirling down the toilet'are hardly likely to encourage people to play on this mud.Also his comments that players should get warning of new quests,and that (by implication) players should be allowed warning ofremoval of illegally good code, is just plain stupid.Also he is going to be a 'too good items' wizard, I suspect,from his remarks about 30 is not very tough' and so on.               [*Moonchild*]**Yoda killed a player (Patience) this morning because he wouldn't share information about a quest on another MUD with him. Patience should havehis experience restored to the pre-kill value and Yoda should be banishedfor this blatantly illegal action. The message needs to go out that thekilling of players by wizards will not be tolerated.-Silas**Actually, it was a quest on *** THIS *** mud that he was wanting the infoabout. Anyway, I have banished Yoda, pending a full investigation of this,and also the rumours that Yoda == Magar == Magus).                           [*Moonchild*]**"
