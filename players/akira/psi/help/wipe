	A mindwipe is a devistating power that allows a psionicist to
	block parts of a victims mind. When a target is hit with a
	mindwipe they will forget how to use there weapons, and then
	they will unwield them. The effects of a mindwipe only last
	for a short time, so do what you have to as fast as you can.
