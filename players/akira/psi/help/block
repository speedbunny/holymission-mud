	Through the use of a mindblock the psionicist can close his
        mind to the power of others. This means if two psionicists
        were to engage in combat if you had a mindblock up you could
        not be hit with psionic powers. The drawback to this power
        is that while your mindblock is up, you may not use any of
	your psionic powers.
