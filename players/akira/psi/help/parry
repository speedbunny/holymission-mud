+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

	Level: 1
	Cost: FREE
	Type: Deffensive
	Text: none this power is always on

	This power works in many ways like a normal parry. The big
	difference is that a psionicist uses telekinetic pushes to
	move incoming attacks out of his path. In this way a good
	psionicist can effectivly parry attacks without lifting a
	hand to stop them. You will get better at this power as you
	go up in levels.
