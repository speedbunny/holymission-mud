   in the room. The psychic can levitate the object out of reach of all
   other monsters, players, and even himself.
	
	EFFECT: The object becomes un-gettable for 30 seconds. The object
   will be given a '(levitated)' pretitle.
	COST: object's weight * 5
	
	Since the effect only lasts 30 seconds, there shouldn't be a problem
   will a psychic going around levitating everything in sight.
