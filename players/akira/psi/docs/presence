			PRESENCE SENSE:

	The psychic is able to focus his thoughts, and reach out to sense
   the aura, and signature of other being in the room. Through this, he can
   tell if there are any invisible beings in the room.

	EFFECT: The psychic would be able to tell if there were any invis
     	livings in the room. He would be given a message like , 'You sense
	the presence of (one, a few, many) others in the room.'

	COST: 35 sp

	I don't see any bad side effects. It's less effective than true
	sight, because you won't actually see the invis livings in the
	description, just know that they are there.
