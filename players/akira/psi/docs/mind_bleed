			MIND BLEED:
	The psychic is able to psionically drain an living's spell points.
    The amount drained is dependant upon level. The act is hostile in it's
    very nature. 
	EFFECT: The pschic can drain sp from the a living, and use them
 	to replenish his own sp. The act is hostile, and starts combat
	immediately, and can be used in combat. The ability takes 2-3 rounds
	to take effect.
	COST: free
	DRAIN: level * 5 + legend level * 8

	Possible mud effect: There were 2 ways that we thought of handling
	this ability. 1) The psychic's have low sp, so they would be forced
	to mind bleed often. The psychic could bleed past his limit, and
	store additional sp for use. 2) The sp have a 'normal' amount of
	sp, and just use this to replenish them
	Since the ability initates combat, I doubt that it would be used 
	against player much.
