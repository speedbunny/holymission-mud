			ASTRAL PROJECTION:

	The psychic is able to go into a meditative state and astrally
   project his mind. In the astral form, the psychic is free to roam the
   mud, passing through everything as if he were a ghost. In astral form,
   the psychic is totally undetectable by anty means except by another in
   astral form. The psychic is unable to effect the real world in any manner,
   and form. The psychic can, at any time, return to his body. If the psychic
   is attacked, the astral projection will be slamed back into the body!

	EFFECT: The psychic could effectively walk around the mud intouched.
  	The thing is, in astral form he can't get, drop, talk, attack, cast
	psionics, nothing except look and listen.

	COST: 10sp

	Possible mud effects: The psychic would basically leave his body. The
	psychic's body would remain in a trance, until the psychic returned.
	He would be able to look around, withtout fear of being noticed or
	attacked. In the mean time, his realy body could be attacked, but
	the psychic would return his his body the moment that happened.
	I want to add a astral realm after the psionic guild is finished, and
	maybe add a guild quest in the astral realm. The player could be
	robbed by a thief with ease (add bonus to steal) while wondering
	around, but would be alerted of so.
