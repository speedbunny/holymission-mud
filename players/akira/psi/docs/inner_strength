		SUMMON INNER STRENGTH:

	The psychic is able to gather all his internal strength's to boost
   him for a limited time. The psychic becomes stronger, and able to deaden
   pain. The effects are for a limited time, and leave the psychic drained.
   The psychic will always finsish in worse state then when he started.

	EFFECT: +x strength, where x=level, +1/3 hitpoints. Once the duration
     	expires, the player goes to 1/2 his hitpoints, and loses 1/4 his spell
	points.
	COST: 50 spell points
	DURATION: 2 minutes + (level + int)/2 seconds + legend level*5 seconds

	Possible mud effects: The player will go around with inner strength
	all the time. But, if he's in the middle of a fight with a tough
	creature, and suddenly loses 1/2 his hp, he could very well die in
	combat. If the psychic heals, he can heal up to the addition +1/3.
	Keep in mind, that the guild will have a function that gives the
	psychic nose bleeds/headache (penalties) for using his psychic 
	powers too much. (See guild file) A psionic can't have a strength
	and a inner strength at the same time.
