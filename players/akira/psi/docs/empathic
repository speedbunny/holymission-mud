			EMPATHIC TRANSMISSION:
	The psychic is able to transmit emotions and feeling to a living.
   The living would become very much effected by this transmission, and
   believe it was it's own emotions that was getting the better of them. The
   transmission can be used for several different effects.
	EFFECTS:
	1) Fear- The living becomes completely engulfed in fear. The living
	is so afraid it leaves the area immediately. Nothing new here.
	2) Despair- The living becomes filled with despair and hopelessness.
	It will no longer want to fight, it just wants to be depressed. The
	living will no longer engage in combat. The living will stop fighting
	after the first round of combat.
	3) Hate/Anger- the living becomes a rage of emotions, wanting to 
	kill everything in it's path. If the living is a monster, it becomes
	aggressive. Wether the living is a monster or player, it gains the
	following: an extra attack, add +4 to wc, but -8 to ac.

	4) Calm- the living is filled with a sense of serenity. It will become
	very peaceful, and stop fighting immediately.
	5) Courage- the living will gain a new sense to courage and self
	worth. It will set the living's wimpy to 0.
	
	COST: fear/courage- 25sp, despair- 50sp, hate- 75sp, calm-25sp

	DURATION: fear/courage/clam- instant, despair/hate- 3 minutes

	Possible mud effects: The courage will help fights those monsters
	that always run away on you. Not too dramatic an impact. Hate boosts
	the offense, at the sacrifice of the defense. Fear, nothing new.
	Despair will basically make an aggressive creature unaggressive. The
	only bad effect of that I see is that if a wiz coded a mob aggressive
	to block an entrance, but that's just bad coding then..
