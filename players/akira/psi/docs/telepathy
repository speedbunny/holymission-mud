			TELEPATHY:

	Would basically be the guild chat line. The only added feature I would
	like to add is that a psychic could send another psychic a mental
	picture.

	EFFECT: The mental picture would just send a description of what
	the psychic is looking at. So one psychic could send another psychic
	a description of the room he is in, or the object he is looking at.
	
	COST: free

	Possible mud effects: nothing really. A psychic could get annoying
	by sending another psychic descriptions all day. So, i will add
	in a feature to shut off the mental picture recieve.
