			TELEKINETIC PARRY:
	The psychic is able to use his telekinetic abilities to parry/deflect
   blows coming at him. The parry would work against hit_player kinds: 0,1,
	2, 6, and 7. The chance of parrying would be equal to 
	{(level + 1) * 9}/10 + int/3 , so the max at lvl 29 with a 40 int
	would be 40 percent of the time.
