			MIND WIPE:
	The psychic is able to probe deep into the minds of a living, and
   search out certain parts of the memory. He is then able to wipe that part
   of the memory, causing a temporary memory loss.

	EFFECT: The target living would 'forget' how to use wepaons. The
	living would be unable to wield any weapons until the duration
	ended, if the living failed a save against it.
	COST: 100 sp
	DURATION: 2 minutes

	Possible mud effects: This power could be very useful against mobs
	that use weapons. It could also be used against players with 
	some devistating effects if the guild was dependant upon weapons.
	I like the idea, but I don't know if we can incorporate it into
	the mud fairly. Probably would have to make it only useable while
	in combat.
