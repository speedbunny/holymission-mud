		OBJECT READ (PSYCHOMETRY):

	The psychic is able to pick up an object, and mentally 'read' the
   object. He would be able to gather practically all information about the
   object. It would be simliar to a compare, or identify, but much more
   informative, due to the psychic bonding of the player and the object.

	EFFECT: The psychic could learn the following things about an object:
	1) weapon class/armour class through descriptions (not very effective,
	very effective, superb quality, etc.)
	2) weight through desciption again (very light, easily carried, weighs
	a ton, couldn't carry more than 2 of these, etc.)
	3) magic properties through desciption (no magic, minor magic, major
	mogic properties, etc.)
	4) value with numbers. The psychic would get within a certain + or
	- the value of the object. The higher the level of the psychic, the
	better the estimate
	5) charges/uses: Every time the psychic read the object, he could
	tell exactly how many charges are left
	6) powers/abilities: The psychic would be given a list of any add
	actions that the object has
	
	COST: 100 sp

	Possible mudd effects: The psychic would learn about which stuff
	has magic with more detail. The stuff was coded for the players
	to use, so it's not like the abilities/magic should be kept secret
	and unknown from the players.
