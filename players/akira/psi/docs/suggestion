			HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION:
	The psychic is able to implant suggestions into a living's mind
    during conversation. The suggestions must be subtly implanted, or they
    won't be effective at all.

	EFFECT: The psychic can suggest one of several things while talking
	to a living. The psychic would use a different tell command (htell?)
	and use the key word in the sentence. The living would have a save
	against the suggestion. Here are key words that could be used:
	1) 'action'- force the living to do an emote
	2) 'say'- force(more like persuade) the living to say something
	3) 'money'- persuade the living to give the psychic money
	4) 'trade'- persuade a living to swap objects with the psychic. The
	object the psychic trades with must be of greater value

	COST: action/say 25sp, money 50 sp, trade 100 sp

	oh yeah, money persuaded= (psychic's chr + level) * 10 + legend level
	* 100
	Possible mud effects: say and action seem pretty harmless. Could be
	a lot of fun to make monsters talk and emote. Money is debatable. If
	the living is being persuaded to give the money, it isn't stealing
	in the truest sense, but from the living's point of view, it is.
	If it's gonna be grounds for a fight, then I'll get rid of it. I like
	the trade idea. I was thinking of adding a multiplyier to the the value
	needed to trade (i.e. object trading with must be x2, x3 the value, etc)
