		MIND BLOCK:

	The psychic can put up a defensive mind block. This enables the 
   psychic to be unaffected by any other psionics casted at him. The down
   side is that while the mind block is up, the psychic can't use any other
   psionic abilities.
	
	EFFECT: defense against other psychics
	COST: free to raise and lower
