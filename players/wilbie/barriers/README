These are rooms used to keep creatures where they are supposed to be.
The wandering creatures look for a specific directory to see where
they are "allowed" to go, and when they come to these rooms they
"know" not to go there.

This was done specifically for the /players/wilbie/graveyard area because
the tougher stuff was finding its way out to the lower level parts.
