---------------------------- Guildchange -----------------------------

INFO:

     It's really sad but it sometimes happens that people who where once
     guildmembers change to another guild for various reasons. Of course
     these members won't loose all their skills and can use most of them
     whenever they need it.


Which Skills ?

     Most skills, without the natural defences and the attacks.

Is there then any disadvantage ?

     Yes, there are lots of advantages. On the one hand you can't
     raise your skills anymore by training and on the other hand
     many of your skills will lower, with the time.
