PROTECTORS:

Protectors are honorable monks and nuns who are powerful, often logged
on and are glad to help new guildmembers. [not in quests :*)]
Protectors should be over level 15 and bring the guildproblems to 
the monk-wizards or to their guildmaster.

Extra commands are:

1.) locate <living> to get the location of the newbie to help and
2.) guildban <name> to banish a bad member under level 15 from the guild

The command guildban shall only be used against a really bad member !
It can only be deleted by Sauron or an Archwiz.

There is a maximum number of 5 protectors allowed and if this number is
reached all monks over level 5 can start a vote on the monksboard for a
new protector or against an old protector.

The main job of a Protector is to help new members and to protect the
guild against powerful enemies. :*)
