LEGENDS:

The name legends comes from the mighty elf kings, who once killed
the evil Sauron. One of them was Mithrandir or Gandalf as the none
elfen races called him.
Legends are true hearoes with extremly high powers. A Legendlevels
can only be gained as mortal when she fulfills following purposes:

    1.) She knows the World well:   Age of 6 or more days realtime
    2.) She is very experienced:    Experience above 2000000
    3.) Or she is one of the Protectors of our guild.

If these points are ok you will be a level 1 Legend. Then for any
500000 experience you get a new legend level up to 150.

The advantage of a Legend is the honor, the greater power and
the lower costs for many abilities. This will raise with each
Legendlevel you get. With the command 'monk legends' you find
out which legends are online. 
The Legendlevel is updated with the 'fix' command and when you login again.

With the command 'accept' <playername> Legends can allow other races,
( even if not human ) to join our guild.
