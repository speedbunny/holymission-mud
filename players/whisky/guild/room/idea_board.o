I guess that's to be expected. *sigh*\nse la vie.  But i'm back now and I'll do plenty of bitchin\nfor all of us. \n\nSincerely yours,\n\n\t~]:) Relgar\n\n\n**\nQuit your damn monk guild, and join us Thieves.\nPlain and simple! ;)\n\n    Almighty Evil\n\n\n**\nDon't join the thieves unless you like robbing and like every one here to hate you.  Join the guild like mages, samurai, barbarians those are teh best guild right now. \nI also heard that the monk guild will not be erased but will slowly be improve to fit with the other guilds :) bare with us monkies.  and hope that our wonderful wizzes fix our wonderful guild \n\nThe every faithful monk\nJaer\n\n\n**\nWE WOULDNT HAVE TO GET A NEW GUILDMASTER IF THE FUCKING ASSHOLES DIDNT LOCK\nWARLORD FROM THE MONK FILES NOW WOULD WE???????  NOW YOU ARE BITCHING THAT \nHE WAS NEVER HERE, WELL IT'S HARD TO BE GM AND NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING \nFOR THE GUILD YOU CREATED..ITSNT IT??????\nAS FOR OUR NEW GM I DONT GIVE TWO FLYING FUCKS WHO IT IS...BUT THEN \nAGAIN WHAT DOES MY OPIOION MATTER....NOW I SEE WHY EVERYONE GETS SO PISSED AT\nTHIS DAMN MUD! IT'S NOTHING BUT RED TAPE HERE!!!!!! I HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY THE \n\"NEW\" HOLY MISSION MONKS! WE WERE THE BEST GUILD HERE, NOW WE SUCK!!!  \nENJOY LIFE!\n-LYNNE (WHO HAPPENNS TO BE VERY PISSED!)\n\n\n**\nI think that the guild need it's death back :)\n\n\n**\nHey there..it's me. I agree with Jaer..I MISS MY DEATH!!! it was totally\nkick ass!\n -Oasis\n\n\n**\nHey Jaer don't give the whole thieves guild a bad name. I know\nwe have our share of dicks in the guild but we also have our\nbetter qualities and players. I don't think it's fair to judge a \nguild by it's negative qualities. Cause if you judge one guild that\nway aren't you judging them all the same way. And if You are judging \nall guilds aren't you judging the whole HM? I put it to you Jaer.\nWell I for one am not going to sit here and listen to you bad rap\nthe HM. Wait lost myself for a minute in the moment of the event.\nI don't write these things to often so I get excited when I do. Like\nI was saying all guilds have dicks and this one is no excveption.\nI personally am probably going over to the samurai guild as another\nplayer. This is no knock against the thieves just a hopeful\njustification of our action.\n-Shades\n\n\n**\nas for jaer's note about danhra...\nlevel 29 thieves can't even touch wolverine...\nwithout a LOT of trouble...\nmonks already have all the advantages of a fighter..\nand death is just like a thieves' backstab...\n\nyou guys and the mages still are BY FAR the most\npowerful guilds...so...\n\nstop complaining jaer\n\nllisa\n\n\n**\nby the way...\n\ni did forget to mention one thing though...\n\nthieves are BY FAR the most fun guild though!!\n\nllisa\n\n\n**\nI know that monks sucks they are nothing like the fighter because the fighter are powerufl :)\nI agree that we give back the death to the monks they deserve it the monk can't hits as strong as us and they can't even hit above smash with bone crushing sound :) that why :)\n\nAnother point prove by Warrak, the captain\n\n\n**\nSomeone needs to clean off this friggin' board...\n\n\n\n**\nWheres my letter!\n\n\n**\nremove all these damn notes and then....\nerease that damn bunny!\n\n*deleting code*\nmisti\n\n\n**\nhey guys please write me I am bored and stuff so please :)\nanyways I don't get on much anymore but my name is jimmy Huang and my adress is\n1433 w. main st.\nriverhead ny 11901\nplease please write me I have some interesting facts about all of you I can discuss :)\nheheh later\n\n\n**\nHey, I'm looking for a Doom player to test some levels that I'm creating..\nIf anyone's interested, e-mail me at:afm-jacl@risoe.dk\nPause..:)\n\n\n**\nClear this freakin' board already...the messages are at least 6 months\nold.\n\n\n**\n\n\ni got an idea\nstart posting here dammit\n\nEEEEEEEEEEEEHEHHEHEHEE\n\njimpa the ?\n\n\n**\nI post it HERE ok :)\n\nWarmaster\n\n\n**\n\n\nHIHIHIHIHI\n\n\n\n**\nI will post here too.\n\nYakamo\nThe Ninja!\n\n\n**\n101 WAYS TO MAKE LOVE WITHOUT DOIN' IT\n\n1.Tell the other person that you love them\n2.
