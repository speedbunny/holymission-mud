   This is my famous witchbed. I build it up with the idea-help of lots of
   people as Tamarin, Taliana, Cashimor ect.. There where male and female
   characters who helped so this bed is NOT influenced by sexism it's just
   for fun and has no gender-limits or restriction on races and pairs who
   use it. Althought some actions supported may be against the Paulus
   addicts they are legal in the sight of ethnic and social law. For ideas
   and better code please consult me    .....    (c) Whisky
   note: This bed is privacy ! but well can be copied by wizards :*)
