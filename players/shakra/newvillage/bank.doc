   Welcome to the FICO!
   Our bank is happy to store your money safely in our vault,
   well protected against any unfortunes that might befall you
   in the dangerous world outside these walls.

   Our fees are very modest, and you have our guarantee that
   your money is invested in secure projects to improve the
   living standards of everyone in the village and of our
   clients from outside.

   Of course, to be able to warrant a quick and fair servive,
   we have some rules our customers have to live by.

     I - We charge an initial fee of 500 gold coins, for
         security and administration, when you open an account
         at our bank. We can allow only one account per client.

    II - At all times you are required to have a balance of at
         least 100 gold coins. You can not withdraw an amount of
         money that forces your balance to drop below this level.

   III - At all times you are allowed to close your account at this
         bank. We will pay you the balance on your account. If you
         close your account, you will not be allowed to open a new
         account here for at least one month.

    IV - In the future we will allow tou to actively take part in
         your investments, by buying and selling shares in our
         main projects. Of course an expert advisor will stand
         ready to assist you in your decisions.

   We wish you a happy and fortunate time at FICO.
   
                                          The management of FICO.
