This is the story of the Koorubian Rainforest:

A long time ago, this rainforest was almost but destoryed.
One day the powerful wizard Nylakoorub come along and saw
this great resource about to vanish.  So, with his wealth
and power, he preserve it and made it grow into the vast
rainforest, you see today.
Not long, word scretch across the land about what he did.
 People started to migrate to the large clearing in front
on the rainforest.  They praised Nylakoorub for what he
has done.  They named the town that they set up after him,
known as Nylaville.  Nylakoorub build his large mansion in
the clearing, also and made it into a kind of foundation,
where endanger plants and animals are preserved.  He his
setup at his mansion, his office where travellers can post
and report things to the foundation. Nylakoorub named the
rainforest after himself, so that his memory will live
on, so he called it the "Koorubian Rainforest".
