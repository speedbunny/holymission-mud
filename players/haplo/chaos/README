This quest and area was coded by Kbl former god of Holy Mission. Kbl is now
retired after having donated a considerable amount of time to HM. In order
that his area's and ideas may live on his Anyslayer Quest is being recoded
to fit better into the newer style and methods. The recode in no way changes
the spirit or idea behind this quest. And this message is to convey credit
where credit is due. Thanks Kbl!
