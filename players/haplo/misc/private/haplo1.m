Subj: Vote '1' Tatsuo for Arch

Cc: sauron
Date: Aug  1

Greetings. Now that Tatsuo is back, I believe it would be good
if he was reinstated as an arch. I can think of several good reasons
why this should happen.
1. Tatsuo is, from what I've seen, a very talented coder. Having one of his
skill in such a position can only be an advantage.
2. For as long as I can remember, Tatsuo has always been fair and forthright.
If only government officials were the same.
3. I believe that Tatsuo maintains a high standard of quality in the work
that he does.

I hope that you take this message seriously.
Thank you.

Peraphon.
