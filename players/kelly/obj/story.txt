The brownie now tells his whole story to you:
 
A few weeks ago I went to shore in the aim of collecting shells.
I had collected some shells, when suddenly a huge monster crawled
out of the sea. This was such a horrible monster, that I run away
in fear and left back my hat in which I had put the shells.
Therefore I ask you whether you want search that monster, kill it,
and return the hat to me.
You will not regret it. Until then , I hope you'll be back soon !
