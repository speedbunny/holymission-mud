The Druid Lakmir is a rathr hungry individual.  Unfortunately, his cook has
recently died due to an overdose of fish soup.  If the Druid does not get
something into his stomach rather quickly, he has threatened to turn the 
whole mud into a giant oak tree.  See if you can make supper for the Druid
and avert this impending doom!
