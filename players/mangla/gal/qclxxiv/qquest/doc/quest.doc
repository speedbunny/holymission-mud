Guidelines for solving Qclxxiv's Island Dragon quest.

  First some notes: the region is a VERY large, 7 fingered leaf
  shaped zone.  With a circular room in the heart, a circular hall around
  that, a small stem, a base of the leaf (entrance), and a root area. And
  also an island on top of the northern finger.  To emulate a player that
  has walked around a bit and has an idea about the area: These 7 fingers are
  reachable from the circular hall. The most southeastern one, leaf1, is
  a small green region, with hills, some rastamen, and grabbit holes. The
  east finger, leaf2, is a farming region. The northeast finger (3) is a
  small fishing village, dykestreet, with a dyke around it. The north
  finger, leaf4, is the wadden area (a tidal zone) with playerkilling
  capacities and warnings. The northwest finger, leaf5, is a labyrinth,
  with a very tough monster guarding the entrance (some books in the
  library reveal that press shield (near entrance) may help though...
  The west finger, leaf6, is the skum leaf, filled with skum and skums.
  The southwest finger, leaf7, is the dwarfen leaf, where dwarfs and
  mushrooms and mines are.
  
  When testing  make sure your min and mout are standard (leaves  arrives).
  Some monsters expect it to be able to follow you (for your good or for
  your bad:-).
  Oh yes, all kind of weird happenings or all special things in the leaf,
  are somehow explained in some of the books in the library, building a
  rough gapped 3000 year history to make the region have a consistent
  setting. The dynasty of Q's (now Q174,  or Qclxxiv, is ruling) are some
  kind of wizards or magicians that have all kinds of special skills, each
  contributed his own stuff and knowledge to the leaf, and some made more
  or less big mistakes, creating all kinds of troubles in the leaf, even
  now.  One Q created the terrible Island Dragon, later locked on the
  Island of Qi, and heavily isolated. But now the ppl in the leaf would
  like the beautiful island back, and are waiting for an adventurer that
  will kill the dragon.  Anyway   all these stories are to be found in
  the books of the library,  right north of the entrance hall of the 
  region.

- Wait in entrance room (~/entrance) until ghost of q173 says
  'q172 hides in a machine in the circular room' or so.
- Go w n n n n nw     give beggar 10 coins (he'll give a note which
   is a map that helps in center of area).
- Go nw ne ne s s s   find a (0-payout) jackpot
- Play jackpot until you win and get sucked into the machine, meet q172
- Q172 will give a hint to find 1st piece of a map now:
    He'll tell you to find a specific book in the library (gives a title)
    title is player-name dependent.
- Goto library north of entrance (~/library/qlibrary 
    or n n n sw sw se se s s s s e n) which you might have seen when
    first checking out area around entrance.
- In the library an index is on the table (get index from table)
    books (25) are on shelfs (get red book from green shelf, put book on shelf)
   However it appears the title is not there.
   There is a list on the wall though, showing books out on loan, and the
   persons that have borrowed them with some address info.
   There the title you are looking for is found, one of:
    On loan: (book                - name, address) 
    On distant killing            - Gruelbert, shelter
    Diamonds and where to dig     - Khnurt, mushroom
    Maps of the leaf              - Errol, shanty in hills
    How to become a wiz in 1 week - Joe, barn
    Monster Almanak               - Jack, shed
    Experience the easy way       - Dirthead, shackle

- Now using the implicit info in the names and addresses (like the barn or
   shed, that are to be found in farming finger of the leaf) and info in
   books optionally, and a little knowledge of the various fingers of the
   leaf by strolling around a bit (shields next to openings to each finger
   give more info on type of region and associated Q's),  we can determine
   where to look for the book. To make it playable for testing:
            book                    enter hut/shed/etc   dwarf with key
    On distant killing            - leaf6/q16            leaf6/q15
    Diamonds and where to dig     - leaf7/r5             leaf7/toproom
    Maps of the leaf              - leaf1/l7             leaf1/l5
    How to become a wiz in 1 week - leaf2/n14            leaf2/n16
    Monster Almanak               - leaf2/n5             leaf2/n6
    Experience the easy way       - leaf6/q4             leaf6/q5
  A dwarf is in vicinity of each hut/etc, and carries a key of same material
  as the lock on the door into the hut/shackle/etc.
  Kill the dwarf, enter the hut/shed/whatever,  go to next room, search shelf
  find the book, get it, open it, note falls out of it.  Get note. Read note.
  Notes  says:  Shit....I've lost it to this or that monster... (or so)
  Note crumbles to dust.. Book crumbles to dust.

- Find the monster (there may be several of that type)  and kill it.
  When dying a piece of map will be added to corpse (if u killed the
  intended monster) So not visible before killed:-). To help in test playing:
(finger/subdir animal on note  room in subdir)
  leaf2  big whitefly        n6
  leaf2  greenbug            n10
  leaf2  redmargined aphid   n16
  leaf6  skunk               q16
  leaf6  viper               q10
  leaf6  vulture             q6
  leaf7  dwarfwizard         r1

- Now go back to ~/circular/cc_s   play jackpot until let in, and Q172
  will give second map piece hint:  `check out the inscription on the
  statue of this or that Q'. Via the books, as well as types of region
  of each finger and shields next to openings to the fingers, you'll be
  able to guess where the statue of  your specific Q is.  To help in
  testplaying:
  leaf1/l4      q47 master of herb cultivation
  leaf2/n3      q57 master of agrimagical spells
  leaf2/n13     q119 master of agrimagical curses
  leaf2/n8      q146 master of weather control
  leaf6/q3      q117 master of monster taming magic
  leaf6/q9      q84 master of gold creating
  leaf6/q14     q128 curses of regions and creatures
  leaf7/r6      q48 mining and minerals
  leaf3/s4      q115 fishing spells

- Now go to the statue, read the inscription (other statues will not
  give you useful info). It will say:  dig at the place you will meet
  in a vision.  A red stone will fall one your head (into inventory).
  Keep the stone (it is a vicinity stone to check if the dragon is near).
  The first two exa [red] stone commands will result in a vision shortly
  after, in which just the long() of a room in one of the fingers is
  shown.  Using knowledge of the finger characteristics, and what you
  see, you find the room you saw in the visions, and dig there, using a
  spade bought in the shop east of the entrance. (~/obj/spade.c).
  If in right room, you will find the second piece of map.
  For test playing:   the vision will show any of the following rooms:
  in 'hilly' leaf: leaf1/l8
  in farming leaf: leaf2/n1
                   leaf2/n9
                   leaf2/n15
  in skum leaf:    leaf6/q3
                   leaf6/q7
                   leaf6/q9
  in dwarfen leaf: leaf7/r6

- Now go to ~/circular/cc_s   play jackpot   and get third hint from
  q172. He'll say: (a.o.) You'll find the info in the room in the
  labyrinth of this and that Q (some number).   Dont check the other
  rooms.  (or something expressing the same).
  This labyrinth is hard, but doable when you make a map. However, in
  the deepest room of the root a map is hidden (dig there with a spade
  bought in shop east of entrance) however a player > level 5 (and not
  wizard) cant leaf the root system before all (up to 30) eelworms are
  killed (and these adapt to your level and wc etc:-). So only a few
  lucky ones might have the map at their possession.
  Now these rooms have the Q's name on it in a special alphabet. You
  could long have learned it by colecting all the texts on the many
  bilingual boards and signs in the leaf. The names are put in roman, 
  and then in qlanguage,  so encoded  Q, i, v, c, x, l  are all chars
  really needed. Each of the rooms are in halls at the end of the maze
  in the northwest finger. Each room contains a VERY deadly monster
  for which has been warned underway various times. Each monster will
  not attack if you do comply to certain rules. I.e. have an hp below
  30.  These barriers are described in the many books in the library,
  using the index, the history book, references, and checking books of
  Q's of similar bussiness as the Q your looking for, you'll get to
  know how to avoid (nearly) dying in the qroom. To help testplaying:
    Q's name   entrance to it (open door)   way of surviving
 q30           leaf5/h01                    take with you a book and
                                        no weapons (notebook from
                                        shop east of entrance will do)
 q77           leaf5/h02                    bring ABSOLUTELY NO money
 q117                  3                    have an SP < 10 when entering
                                        leaf5/q03 thru door.
 q146                  4                   146 carry a note with the words:
                                        njoq makl njaq
                                        Buy notebook, quill, ink, in shop
                                        east of entrance and note the words,
                                        tear off note,  and bring note.
 q107                  5                    carry NO light source at all
                                        when entering q05 thru door (leave
                                        your torch or so in h05)
 q64                   6                    carry >= 3 light units (i.e. 3
                                        or more torches)
 q119                  7                    eat special herb just before
                                        entering room, growing all thru the
                                        labyrinth (leaf5/ironweed).
 q94                   8                    carry no(t much) weight AND be
                                        fully sober        OR   be saintly
 q111                  9                    have HP < 30
 q55                 h10                    wear tam (ask some rastaman in
                                        southeast of leaf1, beggar says it
                                        repeatedly, that they give tams)

  All this can be found when sufficient literature research is done in the
  library, as said.

  Now go to the entrance room specified for the Q, make sure you do
  fit the criteria, open door, enter via door, read the inscription
  on the plaque (monster will allow and not attack if you did all
  OK).  The plaque will say:   do touch pole  (this or that number)
  at the dyke  with a piece of (some mineral name). It can be found
  in the mines. The mines of course are in the finger where the
  dwarfs are (see also shield next to opening to southwest finger).
  Also any local (npc) could have told you ( try: 'where are the mines?
  or so, at any local in the leaf:-). The mines are reachable in room:
  /players/qclxxiv/leaf7/r8    enter pit (have light with you)  and go
  down until you find desired mineral.
    
  They go  10 rooms deep and require light  and in one room you pick up
  the right (worthless in shop) mineral.

  The dyke of course is around dykestreet, and can be found if one
  looks at the pole of the street-sign on the start of the street
  (and entrance room of the finger of the fishing village in the
  northeast finger). Just go to  qclxxiv/leaf3/s1    and exa pole
  go to one dyke direction, and check the pole number. Walk along
  dyke till you find the right pole.  Touch pole with <mineralname>
  here.  Wrong pole or wrong mineral will bring forth a rather strong
  monster (not following   and vanishing after some time) minerals
  crumble after touch.

  If the right pole was touched with right mineral, map piece 3 does
  magically appear.

- Go back to qclxxiv/circular/cc_s,  play jackpot, and receive q172's
  4th hint:   He'll say that he has the 4th piece of map himself, but
  that he'll give it if you deliver a letter for him at a nasty place.
  Gives the letter and tells name of monster you'll have to give it to.
  The monster is found deep in leaf6 (the west finger), also known as
  the skumleaf, (shield is of some Q Mastering in Monster creating).
  The monster will accept the letter and give a note or letter in return
  to bring back to q172.    However nasty monsters will have to be passed
  (no need to kill but they can suddenly get aggressive) to get to the
  monster needed. Also if you go to the utter west point a VERY heavy 
  monster will attack. The latter one doesnt follow.  The first ones
  can be shaken off.  Anyway   you bring the answer back to q172 and
  receive the fourth piece of map.    Oh yes,  to get between the very
  dangerous monsters mentioned (and q172 warned for neighborhood) you
  have to enter any one of three trashcans at virtual west ends of the
  finger.  (exa trashcan does suggest entering however).  To help in
  test-playing,  the monsters  to bring letters to, and rooms:
   "Fiendish Felon",      leaf6/q21
   "Horrible Hag",        leaf6/q19
   "Malicious Miscreant", leaf6/q22
   "Foul Fright",         leaf6/q23
   "Leggo Beast",         leaf6/q20

- After q172 gave the 4th piece of map in return for answer from monster,
  you can join the pieces (join pieces    or join pieces of map etc)
  Now this personal map becomes auto_load (until end of the quest).

- Now q172 has advised that you go to the island, but prepare well.
  The preparing consists of checking all books on dragon and island
  in the library (of course), and maybe some more might help. Also
  a spade, light, and some food might be taken to the island. To get
  there, you'll have to pass the wadden area (tidal area) with moving
  sandbanks, blowing winds, fast tide, cold water, and generally killing
  who wants to pass it to the north to get to the island. Also in deeper
  water nasty monsters help killing you.   Warning signs at entrance of
  leaf4, the northern finger, did suggest that the area is killing. In
  the fishing-village, leaf3, reachable from circular/circ3 ( ne ne ne ne etc)
  is a pub where the drunkard and publican might suggest you take a guide
  and a map to the island  in case the dragon is mentioned.  Also there is
  a boat-shop in the village.   When in the boat-shop you ask the old man
  for a boat  (i.e.  ' can you get me a boat?
  then he'll say he only has guides.   He'll give a list of things you have
  to collect first before he gives the guide.   You could collect the items
  killing some lighter monsters  and strolling through the west and east 
  fingers mainly, were you had been earlier so often in the quest.   
  Each time you give items collected to the old man he puts a sign on the
  list you have to have with you.  If list is fully done, give the list
  to the old man.  Then he'll call a son of his, push you and the son
  to the outside of the shop,  and the son (wadden guide) can 'guide me
  guide you   'folllow me   follow you   or 'stay here  stay there.
  To fake the list with all items signed off by the old man,  clone
  qclxxiv/leaf3/faqlist    and give the list to old man.

- At one moment, when you have a spade, torch, etc, and still have the
  red stone and black stones you were given at various parts of the
  quest before (or found or bought new ones,  they might be around from
  others players), make sure to be in leaf's circular, stem, the fishing
  village, or the entrance or library etc,  and ask the guide : 'guide me
  he will bring you (if u follow) to  circular/circ4   where to the north
  leaf4   the northern   tidal area  finger  'Misty Wadden' is.
  If the tide is right   the guide will start crossing the area, and you
  follow.  Else keep on asking every minute  until he goes.  The guides
  know their way and the tide  so you should get at the northend at a
  beach that is on the south of the island.  One step north of the beach
  room with the clock,  the beach room marked by Q on your map (lowest
  row in the middle) is found.    read backside     for legenda of map.
  
- At the island:   all rooms are numbered with x and y ranging from 0 to
  11.  A room at (x,y)==(3,4)  is called   qclxxiv/island/i_3_4.c
  The left-upper room on the map (exa map)  is i_0_0
  Go to the dig places for the compass, lance, poison, and mail  and
  dig there  (pity if the dragon is just there:-). Dig at wrong place->
  nasty monster creeps out of hole:-)    read compass now shows directions
  to dragon. lance is needed to give poisoned dragon final blows. Mail will
  let the dragon (poisoned already a bit weaker) hit you at half strength.
  Use red stone (exa red stone) combined with compass to locate dragon.
  DONT step from beach into the whirling sea.  You'll get soaked back to
  the entrance to the island.
  You know how to use all tools because dragon books in library did tell
  the secrets. Also in fire_house, hut, etc on island, more hints can be
  found for those who did not read enough in library, given enough effort.
  However first the poisoning and locating of the dragon:
  
- The old trees in the forest on the island are all climbable  and from
  the top you can enter the hollow stems.   There are tree-munchers. They
  are easily killed, and yield long lasting corpses.   Collect a number
  or three or maybe four.  Each time after get corpse,  do a:
  poison corpse with poison (or the name of the poison you dug up).
  The corpse will look poisoned if all done OK.

- Locate the dragon using compass and red stone.  It can be feared (forced
  to run_away in a random dir)  by dropping a black stone (fearstone) you
  collected during the quest, or can find in the well (see map).   Make
  sure there are poisoned corpses to all or most dirs  the dragon can fly.
  Try to frighten it in the right dir  by dropping black stones.
  If dragon enters a room with a corpse of a treemuncher he'll eat it.
  If it was poisoned, the dragon's hp drops from 100,000 constant to 
  1000 with normal degradation.  The lance can now be used to butcher
  it in a few blows.  Wear the mail to reduce the poisoned dragons still
  heavy tail blows.   If killed  you did the quest  (you keep map but it
  is no longer auto load)   get key from corpse of dragon.   Look for
  chest (use map)  and open it   and get the gold bars  (if u can carry
  them all)  as a reward.   In about 12 minutes the dragon comes to live 
  again  and you better be not near him no more then.
  GO back to your guide  and let him guide you back to the main part of
  the leaf.    Quest done.   Not congratulated, considering all the help
  that was provided by this file:-)
