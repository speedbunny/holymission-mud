Introduction - This work describes the
process of cultivation of one of the
worlds oldest and most widely used
culture crops, Cannabis Sativa, also
known as Ganja, or also as Hemp. For
production of oils (seeds), rope and
paper (fibres), teas and other drinks
and medicines and luxuries (leaves and
especially the female flowers), bird
fodder and fishing bait (seeds), and
much much more, this crops has been
used for thousands of years all over
the world.

I - The seeds are best selected from
the fertilized female flowers from the
last years' harvest. Well dried, take
the biggest, most intact, and most shiny
ones. A water test (the sinking ones are
best) can be used. Pregermination in wet
cotton can be used, but is not preferred
by the author.

II - The seeds are best planted outside
at places where the earth contains a lot
of sand (not too much) or is not too
nutritious otherwise. Also the earth must
breath and not be clay or too dense. A
slightly basic earth is to be preferred
above acidic, as it promotes female plants.
The most southeastern finger of the leaf,
where in the hills a host of herbs and
spices florish, is a very good place for
planting.

III - In april or early may, when no frost
during nights has to be expected anymore,
the seeds are planted about 1 to 1.5 inches
deep. The top of the seeds (slightly pointed,
whereas the bottom is more round and has a
small bulb at it usually) should be put down
in the ground, so the little stem will have
to bend itself around towards the sun again.

IV - During the spring and summer and early
autumn just wait and select. The selecting
consists of removing the male flowers (that
will develop little composite flowers, 
looking like bulbs first, and that will 
spread the pollen when open and ready). The
female flowers start like little white wires
that may turn yellow, red or brown later.
The wires really are the female pistils. The
plants may show a 'early pre-flowering' after
some weeks already allowing selection. For
seeds of course, one has to leave male and
female flowers both somewhere. For ganja the
non-fertilized (sensimilla-without seed) 
female buds are preferred however.

V - In september or one month earlier or 
later, when the female bulbs are in good
cases thumb large chunks of small leaves and
wires, the plants are harvested. If big the
branches are dried separately, else the
complete plants. The harvesting consists of
cutting stems of the plants. The flowers are
only cut off separately when dried.

VI - Then the drying starts. At a not too
dry and well ventilated place, the branches
or plants are hung up upside down against
walls or on the ceiling. After the buds have
become dry (weeks to 1.5 months later) but
not totally dried out and crumbly, the buds
are separated from the branches and ready 
for use.

VII - This short scheme hopefully suffices
to start up new enthusiasts. Enjoy your
spliffs, greetings, Qxlvii.
