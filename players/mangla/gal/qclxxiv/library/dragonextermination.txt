Dragon Extermination - Qcxxxviii

Whoever could have thought even a 
little 400 years ago that Dragon
Extermination would be a required
skill in the Leaf. However now this
is the case I have dedicated myself
to killing the Dragon on the Island,
to get the beautiful Island of Qi
back again. The loss is so great, it
is worth our troubles, and in this
book I describe the preparations for
my next journey to the Island.

I do have collected some fear stones
as mentioned by Qcxvii, as they have
proven valuable previous times. They
can really save ones life I assure.

I also have a vicinity stone as was
described by Qcxxiv. Which will I am
sure be of great use. Last time I
should have had one...

This time I also took notice of what
Qcxxviii had written, and collected
the proper poison where he left it. I
did bury it in the same region, and
left the Island quickly however. Only
how to use it is not yet totally clear
to me.

Also Qcxxviii's compass I have been
able to obtain, and I buried it not too
far from the poison.

I have collected a set of the finest
armours and weapons, so that every one
part of the expedition will be in upper
condition materially. 

Also for the physical condition I have 
gathered huge amounts of costly foods 
and drinks, and herbs and elixirs too, 
so we all will be at our very best this 
time.

Needless to say we have also collected
fine quality torches, ropes, etcetera,
etcetera, and rucksacks to carry this
all in, and chests for the larger things
and the food and drink supplies.

So this time it might very well be a 
success, if God wishes, and we might get
lost of this monstrous Dragon that takes
our Island, and took so many lives before.
Qcxxxviii.
