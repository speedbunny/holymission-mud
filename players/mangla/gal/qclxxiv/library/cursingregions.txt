Cursing Regions - Qcxxviii

A lot of regions within the leaf have 
been cursed somehow or have been put 
under this or that spell.  In this 
work I will discuss some of these, 
and the spells involved and curses 
laid down, in the case I know or did 
it myself.

First the root. Long ago Qlvii has
cursed it so that most monsters and
also humans can't dig through the
fibrils of the leaf. See Qlvii's work
`On AgriMagical Spells' for details.

Also the stem between the base of the
leaf and the heart, put under a spell
again by Qlvii to be self-lightening.
For details: ibid.

Qcxx's work on tidal areas and whirl-
pools, to lock the Dragon on the Island
are of course famous and need no further
explanation. 

Not so much known are the spells that
have been laid on the rooms of Q's in
the labyrinth of Qlxxvii. Or to the
intruder they are more like curses....
Details on these can not be given here
for obvious reasons however.

Certainly interesting is the curse that
Qcxvi placed on the paths to the dyke
around the fishing village. That they
might never be seen by passing people.
However Qcxxii who was bored after he
had send people to the dyke, who could
not find it, placed a spell on the pole
of the sign at the start of the road to
the village, so that whoever looked at
the pole, would see the paths to the 
dyke. 

I admire the spells used by Qlxxvii to 
make that lion ghost in his labyrinth 
room, that kills everyone who enters
and is carrying any money. 

I placed that cool curse on the windows
of the circular hall. It really bored me
that everyone could look into the heart,
the circular room, when I was playing
there. So I cursed the windows so they
would get dirty at both sides at regular
intervals. Now even cleaning them on a
single side does not help, and it really
makes a difference. I used: &^*%*&@*&^%*-
&^%*@&&^@^*@(^ *^*(&^@ *(&^@*(^^@ for it.

Also the ever-so-funny curse on the cigars
sold in the shop here in the Leaf, that
makes them blow up after a few draws, and
that requires no opening or messing with
the fine cigars, I invented. I really do
enjoy such jokes you must know. I use:
^@*^*#^*@&^ &^%#*&%^$&^% *&^%#&^% on a
few dozen of cigars each week. 

A funny little thing was the compass that
I cursed, to point to the Dragon and not
to the north. I believe this was really
appreciated by Qcxxix and his friends, who
were very eager to go try it out.

Well maybe I'm not that good at cursing
regions after all, but I'm supposed to
write this work on that subject, but as
the reader might notice I'd rather be a
master of object cursing, but alas. Anyway,
as a final anecdote, I also made these
armours and weapons that an owner can 
change in look any time. It sometimes
fails, resulting in horrible items and
sometimes little accidents, but mostly
the customers of the shop are very
enthusiastic about it, at least that what
I am told.   Well I conclude here, and
wish any reader good luck in his or her
quest to knowledge and wisdom,   Qcxxviii.
