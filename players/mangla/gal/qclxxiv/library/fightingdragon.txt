Fighting the Island dragon - Qcxliv

I fully subscribe to the introducing
lines of Qcxxxviii's `Dragon Exter-
mination'. If anyone was close to
doing the job the past decades he was
the one, even to his successors who
are my predecessors did what they
could do to kill the dragon after it
killed Qcxxxviii and most of his ex-
pedition. I'll try to do it once and
for all now, and are preparing a new
big expedition to the Island.

Unfortunately Qcxxxviii had buried a
number of costly items on the island
and the map was lost. Also the copy of
the map hidden in the Leaf has never
been found. So much for all this 
secrecy... However we have created a
powerful weapon and a strong armour,
and as Qcxxxviii was killed and his
men with him, before they could even
dig up their materials, it seems that
the equipment we have obtained now
may be of even greater value than all
these objects lost in Qcxxxviii's
tragic failure.

We now have the Dragon Slaughterers
Lance, however, which is designed to
even go through the hardest materials,
and has been cursed to get a will of 
its own and seek the weak spot of the
dragon. A lot of help has been found in
dwarfen spells to create this weapon.

Also the Dragon Fighters Mail will be
of great use. We had it made by dwarfs
to start with, from the best metals we
could buy. Then we had goblins, dwarfs
and Hobbit wizards apply spells on it.
The latter ones applies some spells that
were also used to protect the labyrinth
room of Qcxvii, as described by Qcxx.
Finally we added our own spells and now
it must at least give some protection
against the dragon, unlike all other
armours that seem to have failed before.

Well, hoping I will write another book 
after I go on this mission, I bring
greetings to all readers and I hope you
will read the end of my story as well.
It still is a pity we now can not poison
the dragon before we attack it, stupid
burying and digging stuff...
Signed, Qcxliv.
