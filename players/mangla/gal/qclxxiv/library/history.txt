A History Of The Leaf - Qclxxiii

In this booklet I will explain in short
the history of the leaf as far as can be
traced and has not otherwise been documented
however, if important enough, references to
other information will of course be provided.

The Leaf Itself has been created as an extension
to the island of Qi, the founder of the Q dynasty.
The first Q's, legend has it, used magic to 
transform a beautiful but common-sized leaf into
a huge seven-fingered leaf with hollow channels,
that was planted in some wild and desolate area.
The top of the leaf, that is of its fourth finger,
was bend down to the south point of the Island.

Later Q's greatly expanded the leaf using spacefolding spells
and other new sorts of magic. Other Q's changed specific parts
of the leaf for specific purposes. And others contributed in
other ways. 

Occasionally an accident, smaller or bigger, occurred during
the practices of the Q's. For instance ....
(many pages seem to be missing)


Finally a short overview of the Q's described and/or having
