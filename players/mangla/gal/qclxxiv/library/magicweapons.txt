I  In this booklet a range of
magic or mythical weapons and
armours connected to the history
of the leaf are described and
explained, as far as our present
day knowledge can access. Certain
powerful objects that have been
long lost but are still remembered
are described as well.

II  A magic weapon that are said to 
be still around in the leaf is of
course the official rootworkers'
eelwormcudgel. Although magical, it 
is merely considered a tool by the 
locals of the leaf. It was created 
by Qclii and has huge destructive 
powers especially against eelworms, 
back then, but also today, these 
were a massive plague in the root, 
after all.
   More interesting is the mighty
skumsword. This strong magic sword 
of course is famed for its special 
power against various kinds of skum. 
Qcxxiv created it to destroy certain 
nasty characters whose names have 
been erased from history. The sword 
has been said to be seen around 
somewhere not too long ago. Most 
peculiarly, rumours have it that it 
was in the hands of a typical skum!!!
   Certainly in use still these days 
are the dwarfen throwaxes, of which 
it is whispered that they are under 
powerful dwarfen spells.
   A nasty type of weapon known as 
the scratcher, once developed by 
Qxcix to fight some enemies he could
not handle with a sword alone, has 
frequently been reported to be in use 
in recent years. Though everything but 
durable, these mean weapons derive 
from magic power sources and can be 
quite effective when used properly.
   Of a similar nature, but sort of
natural, are the notorious poison
skins of giant caterpillars. These
are the same caterpillars of draconic
size that came into existence due to
the disaster in the farming leaf 
caused by Qclii. The first one who
wore one and hugged a friend is still
remembered as `Huggy Death'.
   Finally the griffin tails, though
hard to get, are very much desired 
by adventurers of all types, for its
natural mystical magical qualities.

III  A once famous armour was the
magic anti-weight moth-mantle, gained
from a specially cursed version of a
mutated moth variant in the farming
fields. Most opinions nowadays agree
that these moths have been destroyed
all, once and for all, by a yet unknown
wizard, visiting the region several
decades ago.
   Also of great fame but lost in time,
is the Red Gold and Green helmet that
was used by Qlxxvii, known as the Lion
of the Leaf. This helmet of magically
strong quality has not been seen for
at least two centuries. Legend has it
that is was undestroyable however...

   Many magical or mythical weapons and
armours have been described in this work,
yet even more had to be omitted, yet the 
reader hopefully may have learned of some
interesting tools and legends. Good luck
on your journeys, brave adventurers.
