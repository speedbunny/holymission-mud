Cursing Creatures - Qcxxvi

A number of elementary and some more 
advanced curses of creatures are 
described herein. First some curses 
with a temporary character or rather
mild are described, then some more 
permanent ones, to be concluded with 
some especially hard cases.

Temporary curses.  

One very popular temporary curse still 
is a frog or toad curse. On this topic 
Qclxv's `Frog Spells and Defrogging' 
still has the last word however.

Also curses to silence a creature for 
a while are often useful. For only 
allowing soft talking in my experience 
a: __((*)&*^~*&()*__ is most effective. 
For preventing talking and shouting at 
all I would recommend: __()_*~(*&(!)_+_ 
or in tough cases maybe: __)(**__@!~_.

The more elaborate freezing curses that 
prevent a creature to move I needed not 
much so far, however a: __()*&)(~&*(&^_
~_!_)___@&*^%_ has done a good job one 
various occasions.

Pimple spells have been badly developed
in the leaf so far. Maybe later I will
do some work at that. However the Leaf's
Qiberian Flue that can be called up on
demand has been a nice replacement in a
lot of cases.

More permanent curses.

Of course the (here and for now) non
reversible frog curses can be seen as
permanent ones. A more literally example
is found in the dwarfenize curses and
giantize curses. The latter are less 
commonly used. In both cases the victim
will surely not become a real dwarf or
giant accepted by these sorts, but will
become their size alone. For dwarfenize
I recommend the amazingly simple: __)(_
__%$@&^^*(*___. For giantize a: __()__
__*&^@*((()__&^%@__ will normally do and
ensure not too strong giants.

Hard cases.

The hardest case I met so far is surely 
the Island Dragon. No spell nor cure is
likely to work on it, though the fear
stones still seem to work in most cases.

I did however develop a poison, so strong
that I consider it a curse (beside we Q's
have no tradition in poison so no better
classification for it anyway). The four
ingredients are: <*&^>>+_+, >?^&))_(, a
bit of )(*)_?<>>?<_+), and some *(?><>?<,
after mixing call out: ___!((()(!_)(#(_.
The poison should be used on treemuncher
corpses, which the dragon is especially
fond of. After it enters a room with a
poisoned corpse it will most likely eat
it, however not when it is dropped within
its sight, as it is too suspicious for 
that. After eating it should be utterly
weakened, and most other creatures would 
not even survive a small bite. Hopefully
I will soon be able to test the stuff,
greetings from Qcxxviii.
