   Then there was the legendary Dragon
Slaughters Lance. It was created by 
Qcxliv to kill the Island Dragon. In
an unfortunate accident on this noble
mission he died tragically, and noone
has ever seen the lance since then, now
nearly seven centuries ago. A growing
number of historians even doubt these
days, whether the lance did ever exist.
