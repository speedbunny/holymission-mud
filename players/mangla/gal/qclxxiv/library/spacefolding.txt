Elementary Spell for Space-folding - Qclvi

Many examples of Space-folding wizardry can
be found throughout the Leaf of Q's. Herein
some of them will be uncovered. In formulas
readable for those who should know the spells
used in the examples shown will also be given.

One most obvious example, that I personally
installed, are some counterintuitive 
connections between rooms in the labyrinth of
Qlxxvii. They consist hereof, that although
one goes south from room one to room two, one
cannot go back. This has been reached by using
the following spell on the opening at the side
where it should remain:
___!&^___--^%$@____%$_+!_)(@))))___'`~0)(&*__

A more intensive example in the same region is
a connection over a longer distance. At some
spots I created these, so one can enter from
there a room much farther away. For this we 
needed the much more complicated:
_`_!&^___'-^%$@____%$_++_)(@))))`__'`~0)(&*__
This only succeeded after months of exercise.

Similar in nature are some special windows
and mirrors some of my predecessors and I
have created throughout the leaf. They give
visual access in one or two directions over
a longer distance than physically usual. The
spells can be summarized as:
`__&!^___'-^%$@____%$++_)_@())))`__'`~)0&(*__
and ^%$_____`"^$#++____==. These spells do
share some common roots with the spells used
by Qcvii to make that ghost protect his room
in the labyrinth; the one that kills anyone
that enters and carries any light source. I
think Qcxv also mentioned these spells some-
where in his works.

Rather powerful, but so commonly used in the
leaf that the secret is already shared by all
locals of the leaf, is a magic drawing. A good
drawing can easily be forced to absorb spatial
information and using various spells this can
be put to use again. All that is required is
a good quality notebook and some drawing skills.
Draw a seven-fingered leaf, and tear off the
note and handle it gently. Then go to the heart
of the leaf, or rather the all-connecting hall
around the large circular room. Start where the
stem connects to it. At this point, touch each
finger on the note once, starting by touching
finger 1, and so on. Walk once around the
center and when back repeat the touching of the
fingers. Walk around the center in sequence 7
times (thus touching all 7 fingers 8 times),
and the spatial information is stored. 
Now the most commonly applied spell in the leaf
is a simple personal transplacement spell. It
consists of various steps, but can also be
preconditioned into the note, where after just
the touching of a finger on the note will get
thee in the center of that finger of the leaf.
The preconditioning is trivially done with a
mineral especially wanted by the dwarfs: the
illustrious Micromyrith, by rubbing the note
against the mineral a few times.

Of course there are the very powerful examples
of the expansion of the inside of the leaf.
Without these efforts by the Q's of old we
would not have these nice large areas in the
fingers of the Leaf. However most of the 
knowledge of these things has been lost through
the ages, and what I know I can not relate
here where everyone can read it. So here I 
conclude this and here I salute thee,
   Negus Qclvi
