Tidal Control - Qcxx

In this booklet I will go into deeper 
detail about the making of the 
various barriers to keep the Island 
dragon on the Island of Qi and also
adventurers and lunatics off it. 
Three aspects will be separately 
discussed: How to create a fast and 
local tide effect; how to create 
whirlpools; and how to create whirl-
chains.

Old documents of Qlxiv and Qxciv did
provide some useful information, yet
the topic of tidal control on itself
was not very well mastered in the
leaf until recently. To get to know
more on the topic I travelled the 
earth and the seven seas, and came 
to posses ancient information on the
use of magic to create local tide
effects. Most valuable were scrolls
I found in the Mile valley, were the
art was used already several thousand
years ago. All essentially boils down
to a series of variations around: 
_()*&^@___ *&^_)(*@)__  and also a
couple of derivations of __()*!(&^%_
and ~~_)_)@(@(__. Most important are
the conditions already reigning when
the changes have to take place. If 
the aim is reducing tide effect, more
accent is placed on _)(*@ and )(*_)!~
whereas in a climate with many storms
special attention should be paid to 
the __()*~()^_____(*&! roots in left
spinning spells. In our case the most
obvious scheme, the reader will no
doubt be able to figure out, worked 
quite well, so there was no need for
any fine-tuning at all.

Making the whirlpools was already an
established technique by Qlxiv, who 
did great things with water. It was 
indeed sufficient to take his: __)(*
_*()(~)__()_@!_  and the recommended
__((((_+`_+_(((( for right spinning
whirlpools. An additional: __()*&~!)
__)(*!) sufficed to make the pools
reject objects larger than a certain 
size in the opposite direction. 
As a lot of them were required to seal
off the coast of the island, a special
stone was prepared to hold equivalent
spell-power for 100 whirlpools at once
using Carbonimium, prepared with red
Schmigelian algae. Impregnating the
stone with a amplified spell allowed
common workers to install the whirl-
pools in a few days time. As a side-
note: Qlxiv used a variant on this
to create a water ghost to protect
his labyrinth room. It would kill any
intruder who does not carry at least
three lighted torches or lanthorns.

To chain the whirlpools such that the
poor souls who get into them will get
transported to a safe spot, some new
techniques have been developed. First
the pools, after installation, should
be altered by a: __%#~^%*()_____@!(*&
to make their ends connectable. Now to
create a chain in the right order, we
started out with the last pool of a 
planned chain, and when positioned in
between it and the following pool, a:
__(*&)~(__)(_+(){@(*)____-0(*__ was
applied. At the ends a simple: _)(*!~_
made the end an opening, and that was
the job. 

Concludingly we may see that with the
reuse and alteration of existing spells
and the introduction of some new ones,
a new field of magic has been opened to
the Leaf.    Greetings to the reader.
