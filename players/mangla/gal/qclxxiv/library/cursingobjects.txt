Cursing Objects - Qcxxiv

Herein examples of object curses and 
spells as found in the leaf are 
examined to illustrate the art of
Cursing Objects as used by the Q's.

One object curse always mentioned if
knowledgeable persons are asked for
examples hereof in the leaf, is beyond
any doubt the legendary killing wheel,
as described in `On Distant Killing' 
by Qlv first, the one who made it. He
used a set a spells, we'll provide in
spell code, to make a large and heavy
wheel rotate and move on its own at a
killing speed. This wheel could be 
send at people or objects with a goal
will be clear to the reader. The spell
set was: __&^*~____~%%$#__()~( __)(_!~
_)+!_~~+_)__)_)(*_. Obviously this
last part plays a central role in the
obedience of the wheel to its user.

Qlxiv, the Master of Water, has been
said to have cursed an amount of water
such that when separating part of it
from the rest, would double in size 
the largest rest. This was a complex
thing to do, simple as it might sound.
The amusing part of the legend is that
when certain people in whose house the
water was spilled on the floor tried
to get their floor dry. Anyway, the 
spells were: ___*&^*~(*() __!)(*(!~+_
and then very slowly: ____~()*)!@^(*_
concluded by a _)(_* __)(~(*))__~^%.

Not exactly a curse but more a complex
spell has been laid over a green stone
placed at the island, by Qlxxxiv. But
this he has described in his: `Turning
Lead into Gold' of course.

A somewhat different case was that of
Qxcix. This rascal of a Q sold ways
for gaining easy experience to rich
adventurers. Like in the giant rat 
case, where he had cursed a large 
group of giant rats in such a way that 
they could be killed by babies. 
However Qxcix also had this shop were 
he had cursed the counter. Each time a 
customer would sell any object to the 
shop, the counter would unnoticedly 
place an invisible thing with negative 
weight equal to the sold object's 
weight in the seller's pockets, bag, or 
so. Customers would feel good afterward
and subconsciously associate this with 
the shop.

I conclude with a making of myself: the
`vicinity stone'. This vibrating and 
shining red stone, if under a curse that
makes it dangerous for dwarfs, has side-
effects that make it even more useful in
these days: it changes in appearance if
certain types of dragons are near. One
type appeared to include the Island 
Dragon, which was the reason for finding 
a number of these stones and cursing 
them so and so, now the loss of the 
Island is felt so bitterly that more and
more adventurers give it a try and go on
the dragon hunt, seldom to return.
To share this useful curse, the formulas
are: __)(*)*(__$#@ __~!&^%*~ ___)_(~*.

Good luck
