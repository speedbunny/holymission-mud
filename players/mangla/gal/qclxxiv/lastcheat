Logged by qclxxiv.   Everything with one % is from Apollo, whom I was snooping,
two %%'s are Tanthalas's.
Tanthalas asked Sammy a lot of details in the night of saturday to sunday,
16-17 APRIL. Both were warned by me then.   In the next logged fragment,
after Tanthalas did the quest at high speed, he got stuck in the end and
asked another detail, which Sammy provided:

%% mt sammy i said lxvvjwm to the viking ruddar and he said don't bother me with that crap! what the hell?
%%You conzentrate on Technodancer Sammy.
%%> You nod solemnly.
%Someone nods solemnly.
> %%Technodancer Sammy tells you: just 'call the raven'
> %% mt sammy i don't need to type lxvvjm?
%%You conzentrate on Technodancer Sammy.
%> %%Technodancer Sammy tells you: nope...but you have to be at ruddar
%> %% call the raven
%%With loud wing flapping two pitch black raven fly down and land on your shoulders. 
%%Hugin whispers into your left ear: We'll give you an easy trip to the 
homelands of the Vikings. 
Munin whispers something into the ear of Viking Ruddar. 
%%The raven scream once and disappear into the sky. 
%%Viking Ruddar says: Aye aye, Sir, we'll leave right away. 
Viking Ruddar starts giving commands. 

thereafter the quest was finished soon..
