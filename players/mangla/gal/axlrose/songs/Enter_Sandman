Say your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyooone -

I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he cooomes -

   Sleep with one eye open
   Gripping your pillow tight

     Exit: light
     Enter: night
     Take my hand...
     We're off to Never Never Land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow Whiiite -

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will biiite-yea

   Sleep with one eye open
   Gripping your pillow tight

     Exit: light
     Enter: night
     Take my hand...
     We're off to Never Never Land-hehe...

Now I lay me down to sleep -
   (Now I lay me down to sleep...)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep -
   (Pray the Lord my soul to keep...)
If I die before I wake -
   (If I die before I wake...)
Pray the Lord my soul to take -
   (Pray the Lord my soul to take...)

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed,
In your closet, in your head

     Exit: light                    
     Enter: night
     Grain of sand...

     Exit: light
     Enter: night
     Taaake my hand...
     We're off to Never Never Land-yea

Yea, yeaaa.....
Yooo-oh...
We're off to Never Never Land -
   Taaake my haaand...
We're off to Never Never Land -
   Taaake my haaand.....
   We're off to Never Never Land
   We're off to Never Never Land
     We're off to Never Never Land
     We're off to Never Never Land
