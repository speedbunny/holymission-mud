I can't remember anything -
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream -
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me -
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now -

   Hooold my breath as I wish for death
   Oh please God, wake meeeee...

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me -

   Hooold my breath as I wish for death
   Oh please God, wake meeeee.....

   Now - the world is gone I'm just ooone -
   Oh God, help me hooold my breath as I wish for death
   Oh please God, help meeeee.......

Darkness - Imprisoning me  
           All that I see 
           Absolute horror -
           I cannot live 
           I cannot die 
           Trapped in myself
           Body my holding cell...

Landmine - Has taken my sight
           Taken my speech
           Taken my hearing
           Taken my arms
           Taken my legs
           Taken my soul
           Left me with life in Heeeeell...
