I only see myself - reflected in your eyes
So all that I believe I am - essentially are lies
And everything I've hoped to be, or ever thought I was
Died with your belief in me, so who the hell am I?

   I don't know if I am real without you
   What is left of me without youuu?
   I don't know what's real without you
   How can I exist without you?!?

I'm wondering 'round confused
   - Wondering why I try?
The more that you deny my pain
   - The more it intensifies...
I pray for someone to aaache for me the way I ache for youuu...
If you ignore that I'm alive -
   - I've nothing to cling to.....

   I don't know if I am real without you
   What is left of me without you?
   I don't know what's real without you
   How can I exist without you?!?!?

I stare into this mirror
   - So tired of this life
If only you would speak to me, or care if I'm alive...
Once!  I swore I would diiie for you
But I never meant like this
   (I never meant like this)
     Nooo, I never meant like this.....

   I don't know if I am real without you
   What is left of me without you?
   I don't know what's real without you
   How can I exist without you?!?!?
     How can I EXIST WITH-OUT YOU!!!?!!!    
     How can I EXIST WITH-OUT YOU!!!!!?!!!!!
