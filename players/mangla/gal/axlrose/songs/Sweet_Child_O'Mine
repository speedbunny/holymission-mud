She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
When evrything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky-sky-sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry

   Whoooaaa-ooo-whoa sweet child o'mine
   Whoooaaa-ooo-ooo-ooo sweet love of mine

She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide-yide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by-yi

   Whoooaaa-ooo-whoa sweet child o'mine
   Uuuuuaaa-ooo-ooo-ooo sweet love of mine

     Oooouuuuu-uuuuu-uuuuu-uuuuu-uuuuu-
     Uuuuu-uuuuu-uuuuu-uuuuu-uuuuu-whooaaa-YYEEAAA

   Whoa-ooo-ooo-ooo sweet child o'mine
   Uuuuuuooo-ouhuo-ooo sweet love of mine
   Whoa-ooo-ooo-ooo sweet child o'mine
   Uuuuu-yea-ahh oooooooooo sweet love of mine
