Just a' urchin livin' under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case
So buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

Ragz to richez or so they say
Ya gotta-keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
You know it's-it's all a gamble
When it's just a game
Ya treat it like a capital crime
Evrybody's doin' their time

   Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
   Oh won't you please take me home yea yeaaa
   Take me down to the Paradise City
   Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette but I can't seeeee
Tell me who ya gonna believe

   Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
   Take-- me-- home-- yea yea

Captain America's been torn apart

Turn me around and take me back to the start
