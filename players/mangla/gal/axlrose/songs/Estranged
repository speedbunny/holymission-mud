When you're talking to yourself -
   And nobody's home...
You can fool yourself
You came in this world alone -
   (Alooone)

So nobody ever told you baby -
   How it was gonna beeee...
(So) what'll happen to you baby
Guess we'll have to wait and seeeee...
     One two -

Old at heart, but I'm only 28 -
   And I'm much too young
     To let love break my heeeart
Young at heart, but it's getting much too late
To find ourselves so far apaaart...

   I don't know how you're s'posed
     To find me lately...
   An' what more can you ask from meeee-hey?
   How could you say that I never needed youuu? -
   When you took everything -
   Said you took everything from meeeeeeeeeeaaaaa-iii-iyiyi

Young at heart, an' it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me nooooow...
Old at heart, but I mustn't hesitate -
If I'm to find my own way ooooout -
   Still talkin' to myself, and nobody's home...
     (Alooone)

So nobody ever told us baby - 
   How it was gonna beeee...
So what'll happen to us baby
Guess we'll have to wait and seeeee...
     (Ooohhh...)

When I find all the reasons -
Maybe I'll find another way...
Find another day
With all the changing seasons, of my life...
Maybe I'll get it right next time
An' now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds
You're back down on the ground -
   And you don't talk so loud...
     And you don't walk so proud...
     Any mooore, and what fooor?

Well I jumped into the river, too many times -
   To make it home
I'm out here on my own, an' drifting all alooone
If it doesn't shooow, give it tiiiiime -
   To read between the lines
('Cause) I see the storm is getting closer...
   And the waves they get so hiiigh
     Seems everything we've ever known's here -
     Why must it drift away and diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeee???
     (Ooohhh...aaahhh...)

I'll never find anyone to replace you -
Guess I'll have to make it thru, this time...
   Oh this tiiime...
     Without you.....

I knew the storm was getting closer -
And all my friends said I was hiiiiigh!!!
   But everything we've ever known's here...
     I never wanted it to diiiiiIIIIIIIIIIiii-yi-ye-yi-iiieeeee
