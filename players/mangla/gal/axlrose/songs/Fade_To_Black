Life it seems, will fade awaaay
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself -
Nothing matters no one else
I have lost the will to liiive
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free...

Things not what they used to beee
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real -
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling meee
To the point of agony...
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gooone.....

No one but me - can save myself, but it's too laaate -
Now I can't think, think why I should even tryyy.....

Yesterday seems - as thought it never existeeed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbyeeeee..........
