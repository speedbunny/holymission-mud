DRUIDS

The guild worships nature and so all members have to be rather
neutral in their alignment, otherwise there will be sever
coomplications in advancing in levels.

The main power of the druids are their healing spells
which are uniqe in the mud. But there is also a variety
of good attack-spells.

Healing makes you good.

One important feature is the ability to plant magic
trees throughout the mud which every druid and invited
player may use.
