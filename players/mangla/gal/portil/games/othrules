This is a othello,or reversi in which the object is to be the player with the
most tiles when the board is filled up.
Each player starts with 2 tiles each in the centre of the board.
Players take turns to place one of their tiles on the board to flipover
the tiles of the opposition and turn them into tiles of their own.
Tiles can be flipped by trapping one or more of their tiles between two of
yours. ie |X|O|O| | would become |X|X|X|X| if you placed an X in the blank.
More than one line of the oppositions can be flipped at once in any direction
including diagonally.
Every go you must flip over at least one your opponents tiles to your own
otherwise the move will not be allowed.
The game costs 100 gold pieces to play and this will be deducted automatically
when you register to play.
