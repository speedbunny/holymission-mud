New stuff

1) Bash.. It needs a worn shield
	This is similar to but (both cannot be done in the same round)
	It cannot be done whilst you are berzerk.
	It can only be done once every 5 rounds...If it is redone before this
	then you fumble and the enemy gets an extra attack   *grin*
	You can also not start berzerking again until 5 rounds after the
	bash...
	Bash does (dex+random(dex)) damage

2) Block.. This needs a shield also
	This adds (dex/10)+1 to a players ac
	If the player kills the enemy or leaves the room (or the enemy does)
	The block is stopped.
	You cannot berzerk if blocking and vica verca   

3) Lower This just lowers a block



There is a fn Calm at the moment that stop berzerk (after 6 seconds)
but this will only have any point if I change berzerk to knock off sp
the longer it goes on
