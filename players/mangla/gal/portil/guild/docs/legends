LEGENDS:

The name legends comes from the mighty elf kings, who once killed
the evil Sauron. One of them was Mithrandir or Gandalf as the none
elfen races called him.
Legends are true hearoes with extremly high powers. A Legendlevels
can only be gained as mortal when she fulfills following purposes:

    1.) She knows the World well:   Age of 11 or more days realtime
    2.) She is very experienced:    Experience above 2000000

If these points are ok you will be a level 1 Legend. Then for any
500000 experience you get a new legend level up to 150.

The advantage of a Legend is the honor, some more hitpoints per 
legendlevel and +1 attack any 50 legendlevels. With the command 
'fighter legends' you find out which legends are online. 
The Legendlevel is updated any time you login.

An Immortal will keep her Legendlevels, but won't be able to raise
them higher as she had as player.
