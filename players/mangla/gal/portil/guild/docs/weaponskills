WEAPONSKILLS:

   Fighters are specialists in weaponskills. To have the right
   weaponskill combined with the right weapon means to make
   more damage with any hit you do.
   Hitting better than others means hard training by your master
   Sledge, who can be found in the room where you advance.

   For further info and to know what all the different weapontypes
   do just type 'help weapontype'.

INFO:
   As Fighter its really good to have one or more weaponskills.
   Very important is 'slash' because most weapons are slash.
   You can train by sledge by typing practice or pr <skilltype>.

   With 'help skills' you get your valid skillevels and with
   'help skillstats' you can get info how good your actual skill
   already is.
