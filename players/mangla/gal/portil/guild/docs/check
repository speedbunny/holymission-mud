		CHECK
   As you are a Fighter you have the ability to check the monster you want to
   fight. This command ONLY works on monster and not on player.
   It is availiable for all levels.
eg. check harry

CHECK: item || living

ART:
   With check 'name' you can get a better info about all livings or
   objects which are in your inventory or present in your environment.
   When there is a sword in your inventory and one in your environment
   for example, the one in your environment will be checked first.
   So its important to get the item before you check it, or to be
   sure that no item with the same name is in your environment.

WAY TO GO:
   Check is very useful on livings before you attack them. 
   It can be useful on armours or weapons too. A weapon which
   is magic can't be identified as well. You have to test it
   out then.
   Checks on all kind of items give you a hint on its weight
   and its value.

EXAMPLES:
     check wuki  (when wuki is a living), check great sword, check
     leather armour, check ticket.
