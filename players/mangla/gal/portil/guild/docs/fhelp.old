control your body perfectly during a fight.
The Fighter abilities are:

2) 	BUT a monster.

3) 	MUNCH a corpse to restore your hit points.

4)      WEAPONSKILLS learnable by Fighter Sledge

5)	COMPARE two objects (armours or weapons).

6)	BERZERK.

7)	FIGHTER to talk to your guild member.

8)	RESCUE a player from combat.

9)	BASH your opposition with a shield.

10)     BLOCK with a shield.

11)	LOWER your blocking shield.

12)	QUERY TIME to find out how long left until the world dissolves.

13)	FSHOUT to shout to everyone in the Mission.

14)	TRACK to find the location of a living creature.

15)	BREADCRUMBS to leave a trail of where you have been

16)     PARRY to avoid physical damage depending on the parryskill

17)     LEGENDS when you want to get a real Superplayer

And never forget to get your own Fighter sword and mantle in the room south
of the guild room.
The sword and the mantle increase with your level so you have to get a new
