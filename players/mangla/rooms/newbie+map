Newbie areas are scattered all about the mud. Here are some
directions that I, the gatherer of ways, have come across.

For the complete newbie there is a simple quest that will
    teach the basics of the mud:
             d, n, 5e, d, e

Joy's Park is the place to be on a sunny day.  The nearby 
    tinkers add tranquility to the ambience:
             d, n, 6e, 5n, e

For the peaceful and serene there are some gardens which will
    please the eye and satisfy the blood lust in all:
             d, n, 4w, 12n
             d, n, 6e, 7n, ne, 4n
             d, n, 3e, 3n

If you wish to view the estates of the little people, venture
    into the smurf village:
             d, n, 6w, 2s, 2w, 2n, 2e, n, 2e

And finally there is a rather peacful forest which can be explored:
             d, n, 6e, 7n, ne, 3n, ne, 5e, ne, 3n, 2ne, w
