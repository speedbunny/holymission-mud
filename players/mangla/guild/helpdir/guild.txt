
The Jedi guild is composed of the most trained of fighters.
A Jedi cannot rely on brute force, just as it cannot rely
solely on its mind tricks to pull it through. The weapon of
choice for the knowledgable Jedi is the lightsaber. A Jedi
will also have his cloak handy at all times. Choosing a side
is imprtant, and those who maintain their allegiance will have
greater powers.  Some of the tricks of the mind a Jedi may use 
are:
    bolt, brainstorm, cure, discord, fear,
    fearall, find, judge, lightning, noattack,
    parry, perinv, scan, sphere and weaken.
