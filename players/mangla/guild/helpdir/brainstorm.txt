DESC: This spell is used by the Jedi to finish off an ailing
      target. If the monster is injured suffeciently, and the
      Jedi succeeds in casting, the monsters mind is shut-down.
      Must be atleast level 10 to use this power.

HINT: There must be a mind on both ends of this spell. So
      if it does not work it is not the targets fault!
