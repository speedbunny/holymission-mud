tmp_text "  Argh ! Ack ! Thbbbth ! I had a chat with one of those disgusting \n\"Legend \" players the other day. He had about 1000 hp and 1500 sp. That's\nplain horrible - please, please don't do that to the guild , Mangla !\n I agree with your sentiments about legends. They do ruin a guild. What\nthe !\"!#%&&#! is the point with guilds, if everyone ends up as \"legends\"\nin the end ? No, keep doing as you have , Mangla.\n\n       -Moloch, the inheritor of Taziel's Death Curse.\n\nP.S. sorry for the muddled expression, been a while since my last cup of\ncoffee... :)\n\n**\noops, my fault ... Ben is ok\nmy apologize\nseko da beest\n\n**\nOk.  dispenser fixed.  beast is fixing cloak with even more\nnew goodies. hope you all like.\n\nNow for the serious question. I need a vote on a \"legends\"\ntype system being installed. IF you are dead set against it\nthen please give it some thought, and IF you are all for it\nplease do the same thing. There are a few choices I would like\nto put forth to vote on:\n\na: yes I want what some of the other guilds have as far as legends.\n\nb: I like the idea of staying a player but still getting more\n        levels and poer, but not to the extreme others have.\n\nc: I would like to stay a player and still have goals, but NO where\n        near what is currently being used by other guilds.\n\nd: I would rather not have legneds at all.\n\nPlease post here or mail me with you decisions. becuase like it\nor not i you do not vote I will do what most people ask for and\nyou will not be heard.\n\n-Mangla knows not to go into a list with a prepostion, but he\n         did anyway.  ;-p\n.\n\n**\nLegneds are levels above 29th\nIf you do not wish to wiz then you play on as a legend\nyou gain more power and HP and SP as you gain legend leves.\n\n-Mangla hopes that explains it some\n\n**\nNew cloak is in:\n'transfer' function : you can transfer items/coins\nto another player. You can't transfer quest items\nand weapons, you can't transfer when fighting,\netc. It costs you some SP (even if you fail) and\namount depeneds on item weight/amount of coins.\n'thiefproof' function: If thief tries to steal from you,\nit will display his/her name (even if he is hidden!) and \nshocks him/her (light damage, depends on your WIS). \nHowever it costs some sp therefore use it with care *smile*\n(note: 'shock' doesn't start a fight, only hurts thief)\n\nYours\nSeko da Beest \ninvents for you (tm pHiLiPs)\n\n**\nHello mangla\n\n1. I don't think that we should have legend lvls like in Fighters guild, or Monks guild, players can be a legend there without having reached the highest lvl.\nOn the other hand the max. HPs and SPs for a Jedi are a joke anyway.\nAt vampire quest it was not possible for me to even swing the lightsaber once befor I was down on 0 HPs.\nI think that a bad Jedi here on HM doesn't look like Darth Vader from Star Wars\nbut like Rick Moranis in Spaceballs.\nIt is no fun doing a quest having no chance to finish or even survive it.\nSo do a few improvements, maybe some additional features for higher lvls,\nor let the cloak be a better armour the higher the lvl.\nand as you want to have a vote i choose <B>.\n\nTegerl\n\n**\nHi Mangla!\n\nI really do not need any legends!!! So my vote: D\n\nHope I could help you!\n\n                                        Mikey\n\n\n**\nI just want to know your opinion.\nI am thinking about Battle Fields or Arena or whatever where players\ncan fight each other without risk of pk-ing. Shoud be \nnot very large area where they can challenge player/group/guild/whole mud\nand where you can die without losing xp/level/stats. \nweapons/armors/items will be restricted (you can use only weapons\nyou can buy there) etc. there will be TOP 20 WAR players or \nsomething. it is supposed only for higher level players (legends?)\nif you know Tsunami MUD you know what i am talking about.\njust an idea (anyway i am allready working on it :=)\nda beest (invents for you)\n\n**\nWell, I agree with the legends being abit too much, but since every guild is now getting them might as well join the crowd. otherwise end up a dead guild due to being weak!!!! Jedis need legends like it or not!\n\nGareth\n\n**\nI bust my guts.... now the dispenser says:\n You cannot carry that, the dispenser notices, and just takes your money instead\nEVERY time, even if I CAN carry it (because the item pops\nup in my inv (*smirk*)\n\n-Essen (*smirk* (or did I say that before))\n\n**\nParry has been changed.  you must have 5* your level in\nsp to start it and it will ast for 20 minutes or until you\nlower parry. You will receive some of the SP back if you\nlower parry earlier.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nI thought we get two hits with a lightsaber at my level??\nCould you tell me why I dont, maybe it's changed..\n\n**\nhits even\nnever did get two hits.  just a little bit of extra damage\nadded into higher levels.  ;)\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nThese do not effect our guild yet but\nwill in the future. I will let you know what and where\nas always.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nHiya Big M.!\n\nFirst of all thank you for fixing the dispenser and second\nTHESE HEALING SALVES ARE GREAT!!!!\nOlog-Hai? only a sniff!\nMad drake? another sniff!\nDarkling Prince? not even a sniff!!\n\nGreat work Mangla! Keep on doing like you are!!!!!!!\n\nMikey :)))))\n\n**\nI vote for option b.  I think that legends are fine, but I don't\nthink that they should be insanely powerfull.\n\n**\nI vote A or 1 :)\n\nGareth\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n\n**\n"
