tmp_text "\tMaybe some of us should lighten up, and if they can possibly afford\nit..(Lord knows, they wouldn't want to blow that serious image)...maybe\nthey could go out and buy a sense of humor because it's obvious you weren't\nborn with one....\n\n                            Saffron who thinks Ripken should RELAX\n\n\n**\n\"or maybe they want it removed to have a sense of control...\"\n\nOr maybe they want it removed because they are chordates who have five fingers on each hand. :)\n\"People are worrying about the wrong things if the are worrying about this\nguild\"\n\nIf this is a mud based on medieval times, then no we are not. Although more\nand more anachorisms keep popping up. Where else can you with your\nhtsaber fight a walkman and wolverine in the same mud?\nactually, I feel bad for jedis, it's not their responsibility\nto make sure the theme is adhered to. But if the plug gets pulled on them\nguess who loses? The wizzes who should have thought twice before installing\nthem? \nP.S. Is there any wiz in charge of theme?\n\nPaprika\n\n\n**\nJust an idea from a non-jedi.... Assuming that the guild is not in danger, \nmaybe the \"pray\" function for players to come back to life could be changed for\njedis by adding a room to their guild to allow them to 'commune with the force'\nor something. Technically Jedis are atheists, they only believe in the Force.\n\tJust an idea,\n\t\t\tThe Non-Jedi Barbarian, Qaz.\n\n\n**\n\t\tLion can't be here in this time.\n\t\tHe is in an other dimension and solving a great quest\n\t\t(called exam). :(\n\n\n**\nIts NOT  funny to code crap that acutally huirts palyers\nsome dumbhass excuse for a wizard thinks it sfunny to codee stuff that acutally hurts players and I dont!\n\n\n**\nhi all\nmight be on in the near future...\na baby jedi will be born soon\n:)\nlove yall\n.....  all thieves will die ....\nchow\n\n\n**\n\n        ... because they always seem to have some cash with them\n\n                                                        *Archon*\n\n\n**\nTHIS SUCKS!\n\n\n**\nConspire to get everyone to quit playing Holy Mission cause they\nchanged the level system, I put everyone at their level on my mud\nif they quit playing this one, until they change back to the regular\nsystem of leveling. Sound cool?\n\n                        Gehenna\n\n\n**\nGet a grip  this is suposed to help.  This mud is still officially in\nits test phase. Things will be modified as we see fit to change them\nto make the playing more enjoyable. This way you do not need ALL the\nquests at each level you would formally need, just alot more XP to\nmake up the difference.\n\n-Mangla\n\n\n**\nis that test? or pest?\n\nThe Mighty  Kryll\n\n\n**\nTake it as you please.  I am sure my jedi like some of the\ntests I am currently running.  And those that are using them\nknow what I am saying. ;)\n\n-Mangla sneaks through the shadows better than a thief\n\n\n**\nBeing that the life of a thief is a rather boring one I am offering my\nservices to players. It will cost you a little money, but I'll help\nget equipment, make poisons and kill. The fact is that I'll do just about\nanything out of bordom.\n-Shades\n\n**\nThe large clearing and the Koorubian Rainforest is open to the public...\n\nfind it north of the shallow part of Orc valley....\n\nHave Fun....\n\n            Nylakoorub......\n\n\n**\nHey, beginning Jedi. If you want to form a party, let me\nknow. We can probably accomplish more together and strengthen our\ncharacters before venturing out solo.\n\n**\nJust to let you know I am here.
