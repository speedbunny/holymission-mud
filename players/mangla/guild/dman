This is the manual for the dispenser.

Just 'insert' the amount of gold coins in the dispenser and press the button
of the object you want to buy. If it worked, you can open the drawer
of the dispenser and get the object from it. There is also a Cancel-Button
on the dispenser. If you have changed you mind and don't want to buy
something, just press the button and your money will fall into the
drawer.
