Figley (found at /players/topaz/rooms/attach/fhouse.c) went shopping.
On the way home he took a shortcut and got lost in a maze.
He dropped his items so that he could find his way in the maze.
Now he doesn't have the items on his shopping list (which can be found by
searching the trash in his house).
The quest is to get all 5 items on the list and give them to Figley.
The maze starts at /players/topaz/rooms/maze1/r1.c
The five items are found in the last section of the maze (starting at
/players/topaz/rooms/maze1/v1.c).
