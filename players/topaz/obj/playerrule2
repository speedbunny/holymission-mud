                  Wiz Interferences

   Wizzes are your friends, but not your babysitters.  They are here
to help you with bugs and other serious problems.  Wizzes are not 
here to hold your hand and help you through every player conflict
(Player Killing page 1) and quest solution (Quest Information page 5).

If you feel you have been abused in some way by a wiz then,
please contact: Sheriff, Lord, or an Arch.

Note:  Leave your PERSONAL DISPUTES at home/school/work or where ever
       you may be.  This is not real life....and most do not want it
       to be.
