Tell me the story about the man
Who came down from the sky
Who healed the broken hearted with his hand
And dried the tear dimmed eye
Oh, I would give anything
To see him face to face and
Oh, he gave us everything
To make the world a better place

Oh, where does that kind of love come from
They say that it runs in his blood
Oh, where can I find that kind of love
They say that it runs in his blood

The way he died upon the cross
Was that the only way
To save the children who were lost
Will he be back again some day
Oh, I would give anything
To see him face to face and
Oh, he gave us everything
To make the world a better place


Oh, I want to find that kind of love
They say that it runs in his blood
Oh, where does that kind of love come from
They say that it runs in his blood
Oh, where can I find that kind of love
They say that it runs in his blood
