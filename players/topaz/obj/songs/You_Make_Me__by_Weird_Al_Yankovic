You make me wanna slam my head against the wall
You make me do the limbo
You make me wanna buy a slurpee at the mall
You make me watch the gong show
There's really something kinda strange about you baby
  but I can't exactly seem to put my finger on it

You make me
You make me
You make me
That's what you do to me

You make me wanna hide a weasel in my shorts
You make me wanna phone home
You make me wanna write a dozen book reports
Then pack myself in styrofoam
Sometimes you make me wanna build a model
  of the Eiffel Tower out of Belgian waffles

You make me
You make me
You make me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do
That's what you do to me

You make me wanna hang out in a trailer park
Then take my hamster to the beach
You make me wanna do my laundry in the dark
And use a recommended bleach
When I'm with you I don't know whether I should
  study neurosurgery or go to see the Care Bears movie

You make me
You make me
You make me
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do
That's what you do to me
That's what you do
That's what you do
That's what you do to me

You make me wanna break the laws of time and space
You make me wanna eat pork
You make me wanna staple bagels to my face
Then remove 'em with a pitchfork
You know there's something quite unusual about you
  but I can't exactly seem to put my finger on it
