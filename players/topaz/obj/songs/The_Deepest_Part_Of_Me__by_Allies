Some people think that I'm too shallow
While others feel that I'm so deep
But there's a holy fire of passion
That burns inside the deepest part of me

The deepest part of me
Is where I hide my dreams
The deepest part of me
Is driven to extremes
And I know that You'll always be all that I need
You live inside the deepest part of me

I leave the arguments to scholars
As long as God believes in me
The only thing I know for certain
He lives inside the deepest part of me

The deepest part of me
Is where I hide my dreams
The deepest part of me
Is driven to extremes
And I know that You'll always be all that I need
You live inside the deepest part of me
