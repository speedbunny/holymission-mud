                  Multiple Characters

  Everyone in the mud is allowed only TWO characters.  These TWO
characters are not allowed to be played at the same time.  And if
found using guest in the place of your second character then you
will be punished by the Sheriff or other Administration.

The mud is here for many different people to play.  Do not fill
our mud with multiple characters.
