My area for submission includes the following files:

/players/topaz/weapons/attach/bearclaw.c
/players/topaz/rooms/attach/*.*  (except for road6tobe.c,
    path2.c, and clearing.c)
/players/topaz/rooms/maze1/*.*
/players/topaz/rooms/galleria/entry.c
/players/topaz/monsters/attach/*.*
/players/topaz/obj/attach/*.*  (except for statue.old)
/players/topaz/castle.c


In this area there is a quest:  Figley got lost in the maze and dropped all 
    his items on his shopping list.  The object is to get all the objects
    and return them to Figley.

I plan to add on to this area.  I already have things in the works.
Implementation of the new things will not be difficult in terms of
fitting them in to the area.  There is already one interesting (in my
opinion) thing in this area (/p/t/obj/attach/statue.c).  I hope
to add more.

My area is basically just a little village south of the main town.
I hope to have it added to the fields by the jedi guild.
/p/t/rooms/attach/field1 would connect to /room/crop2 and
/p/t/rooms/attach/field4 would connect to /room/crop5.
It is surrounded by a forest but is a cheery little place.
There is also a meadow with a tree in it where you can jump to the post
office from (just for a little more excitement :) ).

Please mail me or talk to me with questions/suggestions/comments.

Thank you,

Topaz
