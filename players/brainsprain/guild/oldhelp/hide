Thief help - Hide
=================
command: hide
         hide <object>

A thief's skills in stealth allow him to become nearly invisible to all living
things. How long he stays hidden depends on how dextrous and skilled he is.

A thief can also hide an object, taking care to remember where he's hidden it.
Hidden objects remain in the same location until the next reboot.
This is particularly useful when a thief doesn't want to reveal his occupation
to the entire world and wants to hide his thieves tools.
