Thief help - Hideout
==================
command: hideout

The thieves have a special secret place, the hideout. It would not surprise
you if other players are jealous on thieves and how smart they do their work.
Weak and newbie thievs are unprotected and very often target of high level
non-thief players. (Guess why ... *grin* :-)

It is useful to keep that place filled with stuff you don't need, and leave
it to your fellow thieves. Equipment and such can't be a great deal to
be organized by experienced players, especially when they are thieves.
