Thief help - Disguise
=====================
command: disguise title <guild>
         disguise appearance <string>

Thieves, the masters of deception and intrigue, can disguise themselves as
members of the other guilds, by altering either their titles and their
guild descriptions.

Don't tell other guilds that you have this ability otherwise, they 
might catch on to your disguise! 

Legend level thieves are often great masters of disguise that they
can fool people who otherwise would notice.
