First off how\nabout a throw for smoke or flash bombs? I also think\nBackstab multipliers aren't to far fetched. On a wim how about\na garret command similar to the druids slay living?\nAnything that doesn't make it's savings roll get's it's windpipe crushed in one\nshot.

tmp_text "Hiya\n\nArchwizzes can say NO, Windy...they usually say NO. I don't know why but any\nconstructive idea players have is wrong and irrelevent (as they think most. \nof the time). So forget about these ideas or tell them directly to Kryll or\nto me...\nAnd try to act as real thief...this is all you can do. Set snares and try\nto steal from rich players.\nKidnapping is a god idea, but just like other very good ideas this will also\ngo to the trashcan...I have no doupt.\n\nI love you all thieves...do your best and be bad... :))\n\nThormy\n\n**\nHeya,\n\nAll I have to say is that you guys suck (Archwizzes) !!! I'm taking my bat and ball and going home!!!!!!!!!!! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!

Who will you all have to flirt with when i am gone??? I think I should get the title     guild flirt...suits me well what do you all think...\n\n\nI'll miss you guys..........and gals\n\n\nOscar\n\n**\nI am leaving for spring break also:)   have fun everyone and don't do\nanything i wouldn't do.......doesn't leave much you can't do:)\nand oscar....i think i have you beat as far as biggest flirt goes:)\nsee ya all in a week\n              <<<<<<<<<<MAJIK>>>>>>>>>>\n\n**\nThere seems to be a recent problem in the guild with newbies. Maybe\nit's just me but everyone and there brother is becoming a thief because\nit is cool on AD&D. Well this ain't that and we don't roll dice. Half\nthe newbies still insist on wearing armor, get a clue people. I have\ntwo ideas. Either we start letting less people in cause we're just a\nbunch of high lvl's having targets put on us by low lvl thieves who\ninsist on pking when they can't protect themselves. Or we could start\na program where higher lvl thiefs become mentors to lower lvl thieves. I'd\nalso like to ask all the newbies if you don't have anything to say don't\ntie up the guild line it's a pain in the ass to us who use it for \nuseful things. Any questions newbies can ask me just don't constantly\nbother we with trivial things.\n-Shades\n\n**\nive had food poisoning for the past week...\nits over now and im back to fuck this\nmud up agai\nn\n               *big grin*\n\n                   Mauvais\n\n**\n\n     Barbara vs. Rtu\n\n        Another one bites the dust.\n\n\n                    Mauvais, the master swine\n\n**\nWOWOW!\n\nI like this mentor stuff... :)\n\nYour Thormy...

Now we have to take an attack just to use it? I thought the\nwhole purpose of it was to give us an advantage. Well that has gone\nout the window. I guess the next step is to remove the hide command also.\nI also find it amazing that the damage of our backstab has been lowered\nonce again. Soon I guess maybe we'll be reduced to killing rabbits if we're\nlucky. I just hope there can be something done about this bs before we\nbecome even a bigger joke than the jedis.\nShades\n\n**\n\n\tHop on over to Batmud then..  Supposed to have a cool thieves\nguild there (not in it myself yet tho, got too high before I found\nout where it was...).  Address is:  bat.cs.hut.fi   (no port #)\n\n\t\t\t/// Dorien, Prince of Thieves \\\\\\\n\n**\n\tOK, this really fucking sucks..  I just went to backstab\nFRODO, and it didn't kill him in 1 shot.  >>FRODO<<< !!!  This\nis really silly now, we can't even kill shit in a\ndamn NEWBIE AREA in one shot any more???   Where's our\nGM?  Why isn't he defending us?????\n\n\t\t\t/// Dorien, Prince of Thieves \\\\\\\n\n**\nHeya folks,\n\nI would just like to add to the complaints in our guild.  Backstab both weakened and we get hit on it?? What the fuck! If I get stabbed in the back, I wouldn't hit the same round.  Ambush, somewhat useful after a failed backstab.  Snares and ability to steal??? Hmmm...I thought thieves did just those things.  Shades is right, Hide will be next.  Maybe we should just be tied to a stake in a room with Shao Kahn when we come on from now on.  For those thieves with Pk Licences, thats all you are, Roaming meat for other guilds.  If the arches want to erase the thief guild I wish they'd say so cause this is ridiculous!!!  This guild used to be fun,  I don't blame Kryll for this but a stand has to be taken cause this is just plain wrong...\n\n\tDisgruntled Thief Windcane...er..Windbane\n\t\tB-(\n\n\n**\nYou are all absolutely right...I still can't do anything about it but to mail\nand mail and mail and mail and mail ... .. .\n\nYours\nThorm(y)\n\n**\nWell, try Wonderland... Loke needs playtesters for the thieves guild... Just log\non when it reopens and mail him...\n\nTris.\n\n**\nCould you tell us the IP to wunderland ?\n\nThanx.\n\nBlade the Bored.\n\n**\n\tWonderland: 152.94.1.43 3287\n\tBatmud: bat.cs.hut.fi\n\n\tFind outselves a new thieves guild on other muds...\n          ourselves even..\n\n\t\t\t/// Dorien, Player of Batmud \\\\\\\n\n**\nFrom what I gather, and please don't hold me to this, a few (if even that)\nself-appointed high-ass level wizards have decided to balance out all the\nguilds so everyone is even on all shit.  Guess they figure that backstab is\ntoo powerful of a power to have for a guild so they went into the code and\naltered it down.  This is the new order setting in.\n\nSame self-appointed group figured barbarians had too many hit points so\nwent into Gambit's code and altered that - without notification!!!\n\nGuess either suffer the affects or go elsewhere is all I can say.\n>>>>>Axlrose - ...<<<<<\n\n**\nok all......after reading all the shit........\nI think we should find a new mud together \nand continue rto thieve gtogether.\nYes...yes...soon, sometime(need to age 3 days) I will wiz\nhopefully I will be able to get in as a thief wiz and fix some shit\n\n-=Thief-Legend Griffon the Elven Princess of the Thieves Guild=-\n\n**\nOk...now I'm pissed.\n\nThis backstab shit is a fucking joke. Scuse the language for the ladies readin this, but it had to be said.\nI'll see what I can do about it since I personally know 3 arch wizzes. We'll get this little, well ok...really huge stinking mound of \nbullshit taken care of asap. i seen a lot of shit piled up before workin/livin on farms, but this definately takes the cake.\n\nIrritated thief Taz who is about to load all this on a shit spreader and spread some of it around to other guilds.\n\n**\nDont want to burst yer bubble or anything, but\nI wouldnt hold your breath waiting for the guild\nto get better and/or think you can improve it.\n\nIve tried, and right now, the thieves guild are not\neven a shadow of their former glory.  Hehe, and\nto think that we all thought that the thieves guild\nwas weak then!\n\nOnce I get through midterms, I think Im going to \ntake a walk on over to batmud...  Cya all around.\n\nThe Bored Blade\n\n**\n\tI'm told that the thieves on Batmud are fun, and that they have alot\nof cool skills...  I go under Dorien there also because someone has already\ntaken my name of choice...:(  I play a Minotaur fighter there, so gimme\na tell and I'll try to help ya out..:)  Its an absolutly HUGE\ngame, you can pick from over 30 races - each with special powers, an\nexcellent skill/spell system, optional quests called 'level quests' that\ncut xp needed for that level in 1/2 - otherwise OPTIONAL, everyone I've\nmet has been really friendly, and the wizzies DO NOT interfere/play/\nchange/or fuck with things/you.  Tis the last great true RPG mud where\nparties are usefull and almost necessary - fighters need healers,\nhealers and mages need fighters, etc etc.  \n\tOh well, not that I've given my Batmud speach, I think I'll go back\nand play some more...:)  Its a little intimidating at first cuz of the\nsize and volume of things to play with, but stick with it..  Gimme a tell\nand I'll get ya started..:)   hehe   \n\n\t\t\tSEE YA THERE!!\n\t\t\t   /// Dorien, Prince of Thieves \\\\\\\n\nP.S.\naddress: bat.cs.hut.fi\n(no port #, the mud is so \n huge it IS the site!)\n\n**\nok ok ok ok ok what the fuck is up with backstab\ncheck this out heres what happens:\nbackstab monk\nMonk hit you\nMonk hit you\nMonk hit you\nMonk hit you\nYour find a vulnerable spot and backstab monk\nmonk died\n\nwhat the fuck is that???\nwhole idea of a BACKSTAB is to be a surprise attack\nif i get hit 4 times by a WEAK monster before the stab goes through\nthen what the fuck is the sense of having backstab then???\nmight as well not have it rather than that bullshit\noh and i noticed that it became weak as shit too\nalong with ambush\njust letting you all know that this sucks balls\nand whoever changed it has a fart in his head\nid like to know whatd going on....\nthanx\nBeelzebub\nThe Prince Of Darkness\n\n**\nI looked at the code, and I emailed Kryll about\nhow to fix it.  Hopefully it should be fixed soon.\n\nThe Bored Blade\n\n**\nThis board will lose all mesages on sunday.  remember what to post.\nand hold your ideas.  :)\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nOk, see you on realms (realms.dorsai.org 1501) or BatMud.\nThis has gone kinda far.  Thanks all you\n\"higher ups\"\nI will socialize here(maybe) and mud for real elsewhere since\nthis mud really sucks for playing.\nBye Bye\n\nJoe\n\n**\ni think it is pretty rediculous what is happening to this mud this year:(\nlast year we didn't have half these problems;  ie guild weakenings, certain     guilds having less power than others, things like stealing from other players   not being able to be done.....silly me thinking thieves should steal:) \ni love this mud, but at the rate it is going, everyone will leave soon and there\nwon't be anymore holy mission:(\ni wish we could get back some of our old powers and not make it impossible\nfor us in combat:(\n\n\n\n----------------<majik the master of stealing>------------------\n(until they took our power away)\n\n**\nThere seems to possibly be a bug in\nthe guild...  Whenever a backstab kills a monster, the mud reports\na bug.\n\nThe bored blade\n*F**\n\n**\n\n\n The force of Evil still protects the guild,\n\n          There is still hope!\n\n\n                    // Mauvais \\\\\n\n\n**\nWell for only the second time I have read the thief board. We need to get the backstab fixed cause it sucks very badly. but I just wanted to say hi to everyone since I know I hardly get a chance to play anymore. Classes and homework are calling.
