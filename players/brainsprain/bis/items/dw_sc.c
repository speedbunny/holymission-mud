     Thorin and Thelgar are the famous dwarven brothers.  They 
are considered the best forgers in the entire world.  Three years 
ago Thelgar grew bored and struck out to start his own forge.  Nothing 
has been heard from him since.  See Thorin and if he trusts you he will
send you on a mission to find his brother with proof that you are a 
messenger from Thorin.  The reward will probably be very good as 
Thorin is the best forgeman in the world.  However, he only trusts
his fellow dwarves.
