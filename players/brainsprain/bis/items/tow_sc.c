     Towpath was first formed about five hundred years ago as a small 
trapping and fishing community.  When the Bismarck Family took over 
this island chain and chose the island on which Towpath was built as 
their capital, Towpath boomed.  Since then the town has become a 
diverse center for all forms of trade.  There are many shops and a 
huge cemetary.  Along the northern edge of the town is a rock garden 
and statuary dedicated to the Bismarck Family.  The mayor is contemplating 
expanding the town to the cliffside above.
