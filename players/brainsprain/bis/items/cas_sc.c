     Bismarck Keep was build two hundred years ago by the first Count 
Bismarck,  Murrid Bismarck.  The Keep was built on a promitory 
overlooking the ocean.  Though it has been invaded several times, it 
has never been taken, due in part to the Bismarck Families tendency to 
have magical powers.  The keep is formed out of granite blocks weighing
one ton a piece.  A tower stands at each corner of the walls.  Legend 
has it that the second floor houses a force of incredible powers.  The 
castle is guarded by the best and brightest soldiers in the land lead 
by Orgetorix, who is rumored to be over one thousand years old.
