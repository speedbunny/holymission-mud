    Spiral Island is the one island in the Bismarck Archapelligo that 
Count Bismarck has been unable to control.  Darkstaff, an evil and 
powerful mage controls the island and uses it as a staging point for 
his invasion of the world.  To add insult to injury, he recently 
infiltrated Bismarck Keep and stole the staff of light, the symbol of 
the Bismarck Dynasty.  Spiral Island is named for a cave that was 
carved hundreds of years ago that decends into the ground in a spiral 
shape.  Spiral Island is a subtropical climate.
