    The current count is the thirty-fifth Count of Bismarck.  He is a
benevolent despot.  The Count's most note-worthy feature is his sharply
hooked nose earning him the name The Hawk of Bismarck.  He rules his
vast kingdom from Castle Bismarck, sitting on a high promitory on
Bismarck Island.  He is always surrounded by his guards and his 
beautiful wife.
