i see her standing there
more beautiful than anything you've ever seen
she seems to be the center of all life
all beautiful things revolve around her
 
the sun falls and the moon rises
her blonde hair glimmers as the silvery light touches it
the wind gently blows in her face
 
when i am with her it seems that nothing can stop me
i can battle the strongest of enemies
i have no worries
i am in love
