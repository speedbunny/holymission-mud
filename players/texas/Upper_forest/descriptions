Deep inside an oak tree, you have found yourself surrounded by solemn, silent 
trees which appear to be awaiting something. Two large wooden statues flank an
immense, ancient tree with low, heavy branches.

You are comfortably sat in a fork of a huge branch. The branches all around
you are spread out high above your hed forming some sort of ceiling while
shafts of light fall through in thin slivers, leaving small shadowy pockets
in their wake.

High up in the treetops. All the surrounding tree branches are interwoven to
form a semi-sold matt of branches and leaves, thick enough for a careful 
traveller to walk upon with relative safety.

Off in the distance, a small lake can be seen west of here. In its centre
stands an old, ancient ruin. From this distance you can make out few detail,
but it appears that there is no way to reach the island across the surface.

In the treetops. Though difficult and arduos travelling in these treetops,
you are able to slowly make your way through the trees. Branches here grow
upwards, slender and thick with mass, providing few footholds. Nevertheless,
you manage to pass unscathed.

You are in the twisted grasp of a malicious Treant, passing as a tree. Although
not harmful, it will not let you pass furthur in this direction. The oaks
you were travelling through appear haughty and detached.

The branches, although slender in appearance, bear you weight with relative
ease. You are however, leaving your mark. Beneath you, the passage of your
feet has stripped off small sections of bark, slightly wounding the heart
of the forest.

The fresh scent of many leaves is in the air here, softly carried by the wind
whistling through the branches. Far below the lowest branches, the forest
floor lies covered with fallen leaves.

Deep in the thickest part of the leaves you find a wooden hut, with leafy
curtains flapping about in the wind, shaded by a large bank of tough
boughs.

You are inside the canopies, under a pavilion of leaves, watching the sun 
move patiently through the network of twigs and branches, The scent of
budding flowers filling your nostrils.

The forest appears to have absorbed your will and sapped your strength,
permeating you soul, making you feel uneasy and unsure of yuorself.

The tree abruptly ends. Through the leaves and branches you can see a calm,
limpid lake. You can almost count the far off ripples on the surface.
