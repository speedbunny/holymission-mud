This area will be placed above the normal forest area for the newbies.
It will be designed for those people who are between complete newbies
and people who are considered experienced.

It will contain 1 quest concerning an arch druid who will live in
the upper regions of the forest.  The Arch druid can be fought by players
but it is unlikely a player should kill him.

monsters in this area will be considerably tougher and will all be level
dependent (adjusting themselves to match current opponent).

This area is not to be implemented for several months yet but this note
is here for those who need to know what Tex is actually writing at
the moment.
