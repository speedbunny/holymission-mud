descriptions_file.c

This contains all the descriptions for the rooms.



gen_forest.c

This file is inherited by every room and creates monsters (if any)
in the rooms for people.  The monsters are tailored for newbies only
and are not designed for high level players.  The monsters are as follows :

Bats - Level 5
Snakes - Level 8
Treant - level 15 (only 1 of these will appear in any one room)


NOTE:  All the monsters are NON_AGGRESSIVE. 
       This is so the newbies don't get killed all time from any
       unwanted fighting when they wimpy.

if necessary more can be added but since this is for newbies only i think
that with the 50% chance of some monster being there then they have enough
to deal with.

~texas/forest/rooms

This directory contains 20 room files including the entrance.  They are all
interconnecting, and with the random descriptions should easily manage
to convince the newbies that they are in fact in a much larger area than
they think.  It should give them time to wander about a bit before starting
to go through the mud properly.
