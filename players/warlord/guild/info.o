tmp_text "I'd be willing to have a look at fighter strength as soon as I\nget up to a level where I can code.  I agree that guild code is more\nsensitive to changes than most \"normal\" code, but one possible solution\nto the fighter problem is to just change some of their constants - give\nthem a better weapon, better armour, more attacks, better base AC etc.\nThis should be relatively straightforward and would go a long way\ntoward alleviating a guildpower discrepancy.\n\nKatana the newbie(wiz)\n\n\n**\nI don't think it is unfair to give them back their heavy weapons.\nIt is the only thing they have got. Bezerk they have from level 20\nIt will cost 40 sp and they have two attacks and three attacks above 25.\nI also don't think it will be possible for a fighter to change guild,\nI think it is impossible to close the fightersguild. A fighter has only\nimproved his con,dex,str they are made for fighting. This guild is\nunique and should stay. I volunteer to\nguard the guild. That will say when portil took over the jedis i will\ndo the same to the fighters as i did with the jedis. Search for bugs\nand recode them where neccessary.\nWell arches let me know what you think of this.\n    Maybe GG (guild guard) of the fighters,\n                              Suicidal Gladiator.\n\n\n**\nHello,\nToday i saw a player getting killed on a vicious hit he apparantly\nmade on himself.\nThe monster he was fighting was _very_ heavy (shermans archdemon)\nand somehow the vicious hit was returned to himseld\n(himself) and killed him on impact\nKbl and I went over this case, and checked it out. The formula that gives a \nvicious hit is a bit strange in both my opinion and Kbl's\nGerrit got the loss back on Exp, but this case will be looked after\nYour's\n coffee-addicted Dice\n\n\n**\nDon't know when it was added but of course Gerrit died when he got\na vicious hit:  the archdemon has a fireshield!  Gerrit should\nnot have been compensated...\n\nMeecham\n\n\n**\nThis is definetly not a bug in the fighters guild. I looked the code\nover and over at home but could not find a place\nwhere the could possibly return to the player himself. So if there is a bug\nof a fireshield it must be in the archde\n*excuses my keyboard S^ &$#@ * archdemon and not in the guild\n  Thank you,\n   Gladiator, looking after fighters guild\n\n\n**\n  It should be noted that the archdemon was not fireshielded last time\nI paid him a visit (2.5 weeks ago, as I recall).  Unless there is some\nvery good reason to make this monster a whole lot tougher (in a quest\nwhich is already very long in killing) I suggest someone with the \nauthority to do so should remove the fireshield.\n\nKatana\n\n\n**\nok. There have been alot of guild changes. I think\na summary posting of the should be placed here.\nThe ones I know about for new GM's are:\n\nJedi\t\tMangla\nFighter\tPortil\nMonk\t\tWarlord (I believe)\nDruid\tMeecham (When Open)\n\nPlease add to this list where appropriate.\n\n\t\tMangla\n\n\n**\ndruids are almost done...anyone wanna write about 100 docs for me? *grin*\n\nMeech\n\n\n**\nHmmm seems the ninjas sometimes have a problem in that thier skills\nwill not advance. They said some wizard jump started it last\ntime.  My question is who and can we have the solution?\n*grin*\n\t\t\tMangla\n\n\n**\nHello all :-(\n\nIn some idle minutes i am a bit checking through the guilds...\n\nToday: vagabonds:\n\n    -timestop: Since the mages started, most guilds get a hold-spell\n               But this one is the most powerful, I checked it with\n               a level 1 monster and with a level 99 several times,\n              With both the hold spell worked about 15 !!!! rounds\n              This is ridiculous, Why not build an int-check on the\n              Monster to give it a savings-throw (total) and reduce \n              the hold accodring to the level.\n\n   -fasttalk: Same as above.... It words every time ??!!??\n              on level 1 monster as well on level 99. \n              It should be nearly impossible for a player to make\n              a lv 99 monster peacful. \n\n\n                     Sourcer\n\nPS: I couldn't check if i simply had good luck testing this cause\n    Colossus secured his guild/lib directory where the soul is *shrug*\n\n\n**\nOk, barbarians this time :-((\n\nCLOSE THEM IMEDIATLY !!!!!\n\nThey do 600 Damage in on round at will !!\nand it even costs no sp alt all !!!\n\nCheck the bodyslam for that :-(((\n\n                Sourcer\n\nPS: Has this mud gone crazy ????\n*\n\n\n**\nThere is a bug in thier quest weapon code. Seem that you\ndo not have to do the quest to get the weapon. This is\nalso in a secured dir so...If some nice arch has time\nbefore colossus gets back, like we all know he will soon,\nthen could you please take a look at it or copy it somewhere\nfor us lowly people to peruse?\n\n\t\tMangla\n\n\n**\nThe barbarians were changed after Moonchild was banished.\nThe values were rediculously high.\nNow I have put the original values back.\n\nG for HM\n\n\n**\nI had a complaint today about the summoner guild. (A Summoner agreed with me)\nIt seems as though the Summoners get xp for the kill when two players are attacking the same monster nomatter who killed it...\nPlayers in question Gambit and Topaz.\n\nPortil\n\n\n**\nOk, here are the stats:\n\narch  ac:29     wc:30 !!!!  hp: +2000\nlord  ac:28    wc:29 !!    hp: +1800\n.... and so on\n\nThe wc of their monsters about 10 points higher\nthan the on of normal obj/monster, as well as the ac\n\nAnd the golem give 'em about 3 times the HP a normal \nplayer (summoner) has\n\nA normal summoner at level 20 has by this way:\n\n  ABOUT 1000   HP !!!!!!!!\n   2 ATTACKS per around, on with illigal WC !!!\n\nOk, think about it !!\n\n        Sourcer\n\nPS: A good idead would be to patch all player to summoner\ncause no other guild is that powerful, not half of it\n\n\n**\nSummoners complained long ago that when their monsters killed something\nthe monster was getting the xp instead of them.  The problem with the\nSummoners getting all the xp is prolly caused by some quick fix Matt did\nto make sure that the summoner got the xp instead of their monster.\n\nMeech\n\n\n**\nHi.\n\n\tI am in the middle of re-writing some of the guild code\nto reduce the power of the Summoners. As Holy Mission's guilds\nbecome stronger and weaker, it becomes necessary to try to balance\nthem. The summoners are as strong as they are because a short while\nago, that power was required for guild balance. Now it seems that\nthe balance has shifted to the Summoners, and rather than have other\nguilds raise theirs and enter an escalation war, I will lower mine.\nAmong the changes are \"stamina\" points for the Attackers, which\nlimits the amount of time they can exist, and a global reduction in\noverall power (spell power and duration, and Attacker stats). These\nchanges are already being written, just be patient and they will\nbe installed shortly.\n\n\t\t- Matt\n\n\n**\nGreetings friends.\n  As most of you know, I lost MUD access for a while, but am now semi-back\nI have started working on Samurai guild on MS-DOS editor (Not MUD ready yet).\nI have written an overview in /p/e/guild/README.\nPlease read it if you have time and tell me about your opinions.\n\n--Exos\n\nP.S. What are Barbarian and Vagabond guild??????????????\n\n\n**\nThese are a few observations after reading the README file:\nWhy do samurai get a 'Seppuko--Teleport back to guild'? How is it supposed\nto work? They run very fast and no one sees them???? I just do not\nunderstand WHY they should get it.\nWarshout? A hold spell in disguise????? Why not make it do something else?\nLike help your party members for a short while... Ie.Help them to fight\nfor your cause better.\nWhirlwind? Barbarians Melee???? It should only last a short while. Samurai\nare not as strong willed as Barbarians and do not have the stamina. So\nthe ability should not last long.\nWarscream - Remove the ability. It should not be there.\nAbout the Restrictions:\nNo spells???? What are the abilities but spells in diguise. Therefore not\na great drawback.\nNo initiation of Player killings. Wow.... Great drawback.\n\nIt is not based on just parts of the 1st edition Oriental Adventures,\nit comes from ALL of it.\n\n    Dancer in the Dreams of Fate.\n\n\n**\nI must apologize to Dancer and everyoner else.\nI am not at all familiar with barbarian guild.\nTO clarify:\nWhirlwind is but ONE attack......not like a berzerk or anything (and expensive)\nFor Shout and Scream, I want to try them like the book, BUT\nThere is no real effect of increased strength in this MUD. \nIn actual AD&D terms: Shout increases STR to 18/00 for 1 round;\nScream increases STR to 18/00 for 2 rounds,\nand ALL enemies within 10' are stunned for the next round.\n\nI detect a bit of sarcasm against my anti-PK stand....\nI am trying to code Bushido into the guild....and that IS part of Bushido,\nit can be argued that there is NO PKing in HM, but from what I remember,\nPKing is very prevelant!!!!!!!!!!  (Is Cthulhu still around?)\nThis clause prevents a SAMURAI from attacking anyother player for ANY reason.\n\nFinally, Seppuko:\nDuring Seppuko, a Samurai draws his blade and slashes open his stomach,\nwhile a companion decapitates him.  Ensuring death.  The game effect is a \nreturn to the guild (and confusing players....Why did he commit suicide?)\nThe Samurai returns to the guild, but all in the area think he died...\nthey even see a corpse.\nWimpying from combat must either be disallowed or MUST end in Seppuko by\nBushido code. (Lifeblood of the Samurai)\n\nI must thank Dancer for looking at my files (I did not expect so quick of a response)\n\nExos bows deeply to all of the powerful immortals on this mighty world.\n\n\n**\nSeppuko:\nWell if you are doing Seppuko as you have described in the note above, then\nthe cost of it, should not be spell points, but Experience Points.\nI would suggest that for EACH use, they lose 10% of ALL their experience points.\nThat way they are not losing all that they would with a death, but they do\nlose something.\n\n    Dancer in the Dreams of Fate.\n\n\n**\n"
