 HI, All you clerics!! This is a help menu for you to better understand
 the powers you have and when you can have each power.


1) Restore- This is your heal command. Your amount that you can heal will
            depend on your stats. The higher level you are the better the     
            heal. But be warned this costs a lot of sp's so use it 
            sparingly.

2) Hammer-  This allows are clerics about 9th level to create a 
            Spiritual hammer from thin air when the need a weapon.
            Although the weapon won't be very strong, its great after
            a reboot when you have no money and need a weapon.




3) Earthquake- This is a spell which will hit all the monsters in the room
               at the same time. This a powerful and useful spell. But it is
               offered for high level clerics. Level 20+

4) Create- You can create food or drink buy typing create food or create
           drink. This spell will how ever cost a lot. The food and drink
           will heal you slightly.

5) Flamestrike- This is a good battle spell, this will how ever be the only
                other strong battle spell you will have. Since you are a   
                you still have some strength to use weapons and sufficient
                hitpoints to survive. But since you cannot have normal attack
                spells like fireball, shock, and missile, you are allowed
                to have cleric spells. This spell is very costly and can be
                used by 15 level clerics and above.

6) Bless-  This spell will raise the weapon class of yu weapon.
           It costs a lot but is worth it in the long run.
           For levels 15 and above.

7) Hold-   This spell will hold a monster still while you attack it.
           The amount of ime the monster is held is based on your
           stats.

8) Curse-  This spell if successful will cut the armor class
           of an enemy in half.
