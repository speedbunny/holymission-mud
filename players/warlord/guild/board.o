She's hardly even on anymore (which is sorta\ngood, I guess.  :)).  And she doesn't like me!  Can you believe that?!?  ;)\nOh, well.  At least I managed to become a wiz on a few nightmare based muds.\nIf any of you are interested, mail me here or at s1012944@cedarville.edu\n\nSee ya around.  :)\n\n.\n\n\n**\nShe could be found at\na new mud the number is\n\"jive.rahul.net 4000\"\n\nThanks\n\n\n**\nhi guys!!!

It's \na joy to be speaking at you monks again, but I'm afraid I've sent some \nrather nasty mail to a certain MUD administrator out of due frustration.\nI will more likely than not be logging on, as I am sure my character will\nbe destroyed.  I hope I am able to log on and see you all a few more times.\nIf not, my email address is eknabel@ucs.indiana.edu .  Graduation has been\ncruel in that no one writes me any more!  I still exist, and I long for \nmail!  Please help me{_!  IF you cannot reach me, talk to Darastor\nand he will more than likely know how to reach me.  If I am not banished,\nthen{it will be business as usual.  Also, appeal to Herp to lift the\nsite ban of Bloomington, for the lag is terrible going through another\nconnection!!  Then again, he might just close the mud down again...\nOh well... have fun, and I hope to see you soon!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nHUH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's me, BEEZ!  I've missed you guys, and, apparently while I've\nbeen away some of my fellow Hoosiers have been not-so-nice and gotten lil'\nold IU in some mud-trouble.   Well, I had nothing to do with it, and\nI will be on the game sporadically (as soon as I can get my password\nchanged because I totally forget what it is.)  Anyway, I've missed you guys\nand I HOPE (it depends on the Herp-meister) that I will be seeing y'all\nfairly soon, now that I have found other means of avoiding the IU\nsite ban.  :)\nHe's BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!\n\nThe Beezster....\n\n\n**\nch ch ch chia\nit's the pottery that grows!\n\n\n**\nummm..i'm wondering why i got a chia pet for christmas anyways\nanybody want it???...(please?!)\n*grin*\nhey ep how did you leave that note on the 29th when it isn't even the\n29th yet?\nmaybe i'm just a day behind as uusual yet eh?\noh well whatever...\nc ya monks around...l8r\n\n\n**\nSomeone needs to water Eponine.*grin*\n\n\n**\nHappy f'n b-day to me\nI'm just here to bitch moan whine and complain that\nI\"m sick... that's right just fishing for pity sympathy\nand attention... and for 10 more mins it'll be my b-day\nHA\nDannyboy\n\noh come to looney cause this mud sucks\n192.31.126.2 8888\n\n\n**\nI found this on the net somwhere\nmail me at ccreedon@ic.sunysb.edu if you want a cope\n(copy)\n\n\n----------SHIT------\n \nAgnostic:  What is this shit?\n\n           It looks and smells like shit, but I haven't tasted it, so I'm\n           not sure whether it's shit or not.\n\n           Maybe shit happens, maybe shit doesn't happen.\n\nArmstrong on the moon:  It's a small piece of shit for man, but a giant\n                        pile of shit for mankind.\n\nAtheist:  I don't believe this shit.\n\n          It looks and smells like shit, so I'll be damned if I'm going\n          to taste it\n\n          This shit doesn't happen.\n\nAyn Randism:  I shit, therefor shit happens.\n\nBaptist:  You are shitting all wrong, and you must be punished for it.\n\nBeethoven's Fifth:  * Shit Shit Shit\n                  \n       \n           \\          * Shit Shit Shit\n                                    * Shiiiit!!!                \\\n                                                                Shiiiit!!\n\nBuddhism:  If shit happens, it is not really shit.\n\n           Shit\n will happen to you again next time.\n\n           Only he who totally gives up the desire for shit will seek\n           salvation.\n\nBush-ism:  This shit wouldn't be prudent...\n\nCalvinism:  Shit happens because you don't work hard enough.\n\nCapitalism:  Shit happens, and it'll cost you!\n\nCatholicism:  If shit happens, you deserved it.\n\n              Shit happens because you have sinned.\n\nCharismatic Catholicism:  Shit is happening because you deserve it, but\n                          we love you anyway.\n\nChristian Science:  If shit happens, don't worry, it goes away.\n\nCommunism:  Shit doesn't happen unless we say so.\n\n            It's everybody's shit.\n\nConfucianism:  Confucius say, \"Shit Happens\"\n\nCreationism:  ...
