               you are out of control.

                             hypnotisize a monster. It workes like a hold
                             and the durance is flexible. But it also 
                             depends on your intoxination how effective
                             you can hold a monster.

                         of a monster is costs nothing. If you are too
                         intoxicated you will loose this ability. It is
                         very helpful if you aren't sure of the power of
                         an opponent.


  6.) death <monster>: This is a attack for a high-level monk to do awful damage
                       to a monster. This spell depends on your level, wisdom,
                       dexterity and intelligence and after all intoxination.
                       It can be done from the level 20 on and makes monks
                       life more easier. But this spell isn't without risk
                       and it costs a lot of power.
