Perspectives are different, certain things\njust don't ring true anynmore,as you see everyone for what they REALLY\nare  You have entered the world of the Transvator.  the place where\nthose people with special powers congregate and train, under the\nsupervision of RedSexy.  This is the first room where people must\nlet their minds abandon the roleplay and enter the real life.\nOther rooms call for fantasy.\n\nExplore further if you so wish....\n\n","Things take on a more solid form and meaning in here.\nThere an old wooden clock standing in the corner,\ncounting the seconds of RedSexy's life.\nOn the wall you see pictures from Red's Non MUD\nExistance  It makes you scared.  It reminds you\ntoo much of the world away from your keyboard.\nOn the table by the door, you see a book.\nYou feel strangely sad in here.  You realise\nhow much you miss your real life.\n","This is the room where Redsexy comes into her own, in a fantasy\nform, the Jedi Knight of HM, battling through missions with\nher trusty handle and the guidance of Ben Kenobi.  She\nis from the Transvator school of training, and you notice\nmany relics on the walls in this room.  If you find her in here\nshe will be willing to tell you stories about the battles and\ntraining she has received over the years.  The whole place\nholds a magic and charm unbeknown in the real life.  Act\nin character or Red may decide to show you just how tough\nshe really is.\n\n","In here, you notice a large conference table, with monitors\nand microphones, a flipboard and many files lying around.\nThis is the place where RedSexy and associates can sit around\nand discuss the environment they inhabit, trying to influence\nthe powers that be into accepting their suggestions and\ncomments  Although often frowned upon from those above,\nthis place acts as a player's sherriff office, where people\nwith complaints and grievances can discuss them openly\nbefore deciding if it is important enough to seek\nguidance from the mighty wizards and gods that rule\nthis land.\n","This is the room where those who wish to playerkill and those who have\njust commited a playerkill hideout and consider their actions.  It is\nalso a place where many strategies are discussed.  There are hidden\nrecords here of which players have killed which others recently,\nand also of players hitlists.  A big sign on the wall attracts your attention,\nspelling out the HM laws on this delicate matter.\n\n","This is where the Transvators come and psyche themselves up for\nbattles  If confidence is sagging against a tough oppenent,\nTransvator flee here to read scriptures and notes and\nto enter the battle mindset.  Bravery is a virtue, but can not\nalways be summoned in times of great trouble.  Here, if contemplated\nlong enough, enough courage can be gaines to tackle even the most\nfierce of competitors.\n","This is the most comfortable room on this MUD.  Fantasy or reality, sadness or happiness\nyou feel at home here, and that is what matters.  You notice a sofa bed in the corner,\nfor relaxing and unwinding on.  You suddenly feel no anger at what has gone before,\njust an inner contentment and reflectiveness.  Only RedSexy's most special friends\nare allowed in here, and the fact you are one of that number makes you happy.\n",0,0,0,})
