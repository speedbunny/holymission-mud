[stiletto       ] [Oct 31] [Thief Code                                   ]

                And Mask spoke all these wordss, saying:
        I am the Lord of Thieves, to whom all stealing is dedicated.

I       You shall follow no other guild before me, nor put a follower
of a false god before one of my chosen.  You are my thieves, and
you shalt support one another in the search for chaos.

II      And rising with a bullet to number II:  Thou shalt STEAL.  A lot.
However, stealing from one of the chosen is like stealing from
me.

III Thou shalt hold the hideout in the highest esteem.  It is
the most sacred of thief rooms.

IV       Thou shalt murder.  Any attack upon a hand of mask, is
an attack upon the whole of the Guild.


V        Thou shalt honor the Thief Guides, that your days might be
long upon the land of Holy Mission, for they are assuredly these
words incarnate.


VI       Thou shalt give to the poor.  Help newbies, they are the
lifeblood of Holy Mission.

VII Thou shalt not tell the truth, the truth sucks.

VIII Thou shalt cause Chaos, Chaos thou shalt cause.  Nuff said.

IX        Thou shalt mock Cara.  He claims he is a greek god -- I don't
think so.  In corollary, pick on all other posers on the mud, it is
fun.

X         Thou shalt covet thy neighbor's items.  And if thou shalt covet
them enough, see commandment II.
