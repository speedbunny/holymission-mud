Thief help - Poison
===================
command: poison <weapon> with <poison>

Thieves retain the unique ability to poison their weapons, watching
their victims perish in relative safety, where others would risk life
and limb.
It is up to the clever thief to find his poison, and not die foolishly 
trying to brew poisons beyond his skill.
