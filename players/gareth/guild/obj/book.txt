Why hello there Fellow Fighters,

	I bet you guys are wondering what's up. Well, first I'm
gonna redo the soul - not sure how long it's gonna take, all depends
RL, but still shouldn't take too long. Also in the process of fixing
shield block - it will be more useful to lower lvl fighters. The
new skill 'weapon smash' is also in the process of being coded - in 
fact i'm in the debugging stage. Oh yeah, a cheesy skill - imaple
is 90% completed! I'll post the completed/redone stuff.

Some ideas for for new skills (for HIGH lvls):
	deathblow
	knockout/stun
	shield charge
	death charge

As always any ideas for new things are welcome especially for lower
levels.

Talk to ya soon,
Gareth
