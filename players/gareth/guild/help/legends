LEGENDS:

The name legends comes from the mighty elf kings, who once killed
the evil Sauron. One of them was Mithrandir or Gandalf as the none
elfen races called him. Legends are true hearoes with extremly high 
powers. A Legendlevel can only be gained as mortal when he/she fulfills 
following purposes:

    1.) He/she knows the World well:   Age of 11 or more days realtime
    2.) He/she is very experienced:    Experience above 2000000

If these points are ok you will be a level 1 Legend. Then for any
500000 experience you get a new legend level up to 150.

The advantage of a Legend is the honor, some more hitpoints per 
legendlevel and +1 attack any 50 legendlevels. With the command 
'fighter legends' you find out which legends are online. 
The Legendlevel is updated any time you login.

An Immortal will keep their Legendlevels, but won't be able to raise
them higher as he/she had as player.
