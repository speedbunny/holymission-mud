As you are a Fighter you have the ability to check the monster you want to
fight. Check is very useful on livings before you attack them. With check 
'name' you can get a better info about all livings or objects which are in 
your inventory or present in your environment. When there is a sword in your
inventory and one in your environment for example, the one in your environment
will be checked first. So its important to get the item before you check it, 
or to be sure that no item with the same name is in your environment. It's 
useful on armours or weapons too. A weapon which is magical can't be 
identified as well. You can preform checks on all kind of items and it'll give
you a hint on its weight and its value.

usage: check <item> or check <name of creature>
cost: none
