The parry is the skill, to block a victims attack with the weapon. It depends,
your level, strength, DEXterity, the amount of weight you are carrying, and
the level of the monster. With any hit you have a chance to parry the victims
attack, depending on your speed (dex). If you have a low strength there is a 
good chance that the attacker strikes through your parry defense. The more 
attackers you have, the lower is the chance to parry a hit.

INFLUENCES:
   1.) The hold: When you are held you can't parry
   2.) The haste/berzerk: Haste or berzerk raises your combat speed,
                          which of course raises your change to parry. 
   3.) Getting many hits:  When you are hit double or more in a round,
                           you cant parry that often.
