2) 	CHECK - information about a monster.
3) 	BUT - head-but a monster.
4) 	MUNCH - eat a corpse to restore your hit points.
5)	COMPARE - compare two objects (armours or weapons).
6)	BERZERK - go nuts and attack more.
7)	RESCUE - aid a player from combat.
8)	BASH - hit your opposition with a shield.
9)      *BLOCK - block attacks with a shield.
10)	*LOWER - lower shield.
11)	TRACK - to find the location of a living creature.
12)     PARRY - to avoid physical damage depending on the parryskill.
13)	!SMASH! - destroy an oppositions weapons.
14)	!QUERY! - to find how much time is left.
15)     LEGENDS - when you want to get a real Superplayer.

Do not forget to get your own Fighter sword and mantle in the room south
of the guild room. The sword and the mantle increase with your level so you 
have to get a new one after advancing.
