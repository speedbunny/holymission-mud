Dear Jan Guy,

	I am seeking a challenging position and I believe I would make a great fit and be of 
benefit to your company. I have studied Computer Science at NCSU, and I expect to graduate
with a BS in May. My concentration has been database systems, but I also expanded into
multi-media applications. Along with my education, I have gained some real world experience
creating interfaces to connect the Windows NT SMS Server to the Unix platform.
	Please review the included resume and I look forward to hearing from you.

								Sincerely,


								James Lell
