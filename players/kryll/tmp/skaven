These ratlike people are looked at with disgust by most of the other races,
and the rakasta in particular. Skaven live in small gangs. In this formation
they try to survive in any way they can. Property is not a known concept
for skaven, which does not help in their acceptance by other races. Skaven
don't care much for clothing either and, dressed in their ragged cloaks, all
skaven look the same to outsiders. Skaven proudly carry their use-names,
which they gain from their gang members for a special feat or trait.
