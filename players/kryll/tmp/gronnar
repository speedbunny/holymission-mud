These "creatures" are rumoured to either be long-past cursed humans who
were stuck to live in this form, as was their descendants, or some offshoot
of demon, yet in actuality they are neither. Their history has been lost
however. Either way, the Gronnar are the most horrid, feared and hated
amongst all the humanoids, if not among creatures in general. The Gronnar
are black scaly humanoids, with horns, scaly arms and a tail, although it
cannot move much. They are quite bulky, slow, strong and unwise. They do
not know the meaning of fear, nor stupidity. They are quite chaotic and
enjoy a little mayhem. Their best points are that they also give a lot of
respect to those who earn it.
