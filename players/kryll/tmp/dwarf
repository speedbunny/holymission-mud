Dwarves are often seen as rude, fierce guardians or master craftsmen.
This is usually based off of misunderstanding. Most dwarves are
short-tempered, mainly because of their past and the rudeness that the
other races toward them. They live in strict clans and are quite
religious. They are known as master craftsmen, surpassing everyone
in their smithing skills and being some of the best engineers and
brewers, usually having unbelievable patience when it comes to
completing their task. Dwarves normally live in mountainous areas or
underground, and their designs reflect this environment, prizing
precious gems and metals, and creating sturdy tools, weapons and
armour. Dwarven hospitality is not known to be friendly, but they
usually give their guests the same respect they give each other.
