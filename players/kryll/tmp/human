Background:
Since all of us have been humans in the life we just let behind, we all
know that humans take themselves as the standard with which everything
else is compared. From a point of view of the other races, humans are
fairly tall, slim and poke their noses in just about anybody's business.
Humans are quick to learn and easily pick up bits of knowledge of every
subject they set themselves to deal with. However, humans also know that
for every bit they learn in a different field, there will be someone in
another race who will add an equal amount of knowledge to lift his trade
to a height that no human ever may reach. To compensate for this, humans
are a very social people, and their combined powers are equalled by none.
They are also the most prominant race around with which to socialize.
