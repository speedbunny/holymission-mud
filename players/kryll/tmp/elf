Elves appear as a noble race in the eyes of all other races, and are either
highly respected or deeply hated for it. Elves are sometimes described
as creatures of the sun, for their golden blonde hair, their fair
complexion, and soft but stimulating voices. Others name elves the children
of the moon, for they come and go in silence, and their presence can
lead people to safety or to a certain death. Outsiders seldom can tell
whether it's their magic or skills they apply. Their longevity is the cause
that much of the ancient wisdom has been preserved in their houses and
families, where it is guarded against outsiders with anything less than
a heart as pure as freshly fallen snow.
