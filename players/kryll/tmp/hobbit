Hobbits tend to get treated as if they are little children because of their
height. And many are the people who have found out the hard way that this
was a BIG mistake. For if you are a 'tall person', as the hobbits call many
of the other races, don't forget at what height a hobbit's eyes are when he
gets angry. But hobbits are hard to get angered, and quick to forget. Life
is too full of joyful things, so let's enjoy all of it while you can! To
hobbits a good friend is worth the world and more. And a friend's need, a
good story or an intricate puzzle are the only things a hobbit will really
put himself into trouble for. And it surprises often the wisest in what way
hobbits manage to get themselves and their friends out of it again.
