Half-ogres probably originated as the children of human women who were
raped by ogres. When their numbers began to increase, they started to
flock together and formed their own communities, or they stayed with
tolerant humans. As with many other half human races, the humanoid part
generally tends to be prominant and it takes many generations with only
humans to remove it, and then there is always a chance of having some
deformities. Since they have always had close ties to their mothers and
their ogre heritage lead to the fact that half-ogres too have a
matriarchal society. In particular women of old age are honoured as
demi-goddesses. Half-ogres are very closed towards the other races.
They know they have the brutal attitude of the ogres, but
would like to be more subtle like their human relatives. This hitting-and-
making-up way of life can only understood by other half-ogres.
