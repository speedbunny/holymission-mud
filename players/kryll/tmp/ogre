Of the humanoid races, ogres are the ones who closest relate to the giants.
They have their slow, massive ways of moving and thinking in common. They
are not very very sensitive to what other people might take offence to and
their bulky mass makes that they often get away with it as well. Ogre
society is a matriarchal one and women of any race are usually treated with
fear and respect. Although ogres are bright enough to understand any ideas
put to them, they usually don't bother with mental exercise if their brute
physique can get the job done as easily. Ogre's don't practice magic a lot,
not because they can't (they can!), but simply because they can't be bothered
with all the learning that comes with it.
