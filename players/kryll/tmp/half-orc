Half-orcs are the odd offspring of a relationship between an orc and a human
or half-elf. They face the same problems as do the half-elves, and are also
very solitary people. Half-orcs however, often tend to be more chaotic in
their ways as compared with half-elves. In company they are often the ones
who start the action. While alone, they usually spend a lot of time on the
one thing they have made their passion (which can be sensible or insensible
thing). Half-orcs are known to simply drop a job when they get bored with it.
