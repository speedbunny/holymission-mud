These catlike people are very agile. They live in social groups which are
formed by mutual agreement, much like humans. Although to outsiders these
groups may look like total anarchy, there always is a definite leader, whose
final decisions are never questioned. Rakasta are very proud of who they are
as an individual, and will do anything to make them look different from
other rakasta. These radical differences can only be allowed because the
rakasta adhere to a very strict set of social rules and there is little
interaction that does not involve one protocol or another.
