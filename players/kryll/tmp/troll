Rock trolls are the only humanoids who tend to shy away from the rest
of civilization. They are easily confused with their other trollish
kin and therefore mobs usually hunt them down with fire. On the
occasion that a rock troll is welcomed into another race's society,
they find that rock trolls are not nearly as unintelligent as their
kin, and they prove to be a great ally. They fear little that common
sense does not show to be dangerous, eg. a dragon. Their own society
is a male-dominant one, although they will be the first to admit that
if it weren't for their way they would not know the little magic that
they do know. They are naturally suspiscious of outsiders but have
very friendly attitudes when their trust is with you.
