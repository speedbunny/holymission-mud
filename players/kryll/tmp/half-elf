Half-elves are the result of the occasional amourous affair between humans
and elves. Although they have inherited the diversity of humans, and the
magic capabilities and appearance of elves, they are not truely accepted by
either race. They are too restless to fit in the elven family traditions and
are too much a magic creature to fit into the human urban society. Plus,
the inherit prejudices of both societies prevent them from being a part
of either to a full extent. This makes the half-elves very solitary people,
but they are happy that way. Half-elves get along with most of the other
races and often form a bridge when racial friction becomes high. Because
they are used to their solitude, they only tend to do things they like,
when they like it, even if others are present.
