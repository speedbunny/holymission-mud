The dracol are a highly magical race. They themselves claim they have come from
another plane of existance, but noone has ever heard the whole story. Because
of their nature, they are practitioners of magic, rather than scholars. Dracol
have a very strong sense of worthy and unworthy, which they apply to people and
things alike. A dracol will at all times ignore unworthy persons completely, as
if they don't exist. They will not touch unworthy items and avoid unworthy
places. What the criteria are in the decision if something's worthy, is
anyone's guess, but once decided it is determined for ever. Dracols will treat
anyone worthy as family. Among themselves they seem to respect a certain clan
structure, between which they don't seem to mix well.
