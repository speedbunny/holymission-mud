Although orcs and their kin are often regarded as an ugly race, they are
actually the closed to humans of any of the 'dark' races. Orcs are easy
to anger but easy to please as well. Although they are very touchy when it
comes to criticism, this is usually because they regard their honour and
bravery as the most highy valued traits. Orcs are very social people, but
their very open social values are not always appreciated by the other races.
Orcs usually go for the direct, but honest approach in everything they do.
