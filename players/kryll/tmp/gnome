Gnomes are a race which is a distant relative from dwarves. Gnomes are very
solitary people. They are nevertheless very interested in anything anyone
has to tell or show. Not so much because they want to get to know the person,
but either to satisfy they infinite curiousity or to find ways to obtain
things that noone else has. Gnomes are very fond of novelties, and will go
to great lengths to find out every detail of a puzzle. This often results
in the creation of new things or views. But beware when gnomes start fiddling
with the one power humanoidkind was not meant to understand: magic.
