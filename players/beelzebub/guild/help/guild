GUILD: Ninja

DESCRIPTION: The ninja are experts at hand-to-hand combat.  As your skills
             inscrease you will be able to launch sneak attacks, throw
             weapons, and stun your enemies with powerful hits.  Being very
             religious, the ninja can sometimes call upon their god for
             help with things such as seeing into other rooms and getting
             a description of his/her enemies state of being.  Since the
             ninja only fight with weapons that they have constructed
             themselves, you will be restricted to using only ninja weapons,
             most of which can be found in the shop that joins the main guild
             room.  On the same note, the ninja do not need to wear most
             types of armor for combat, tho some types are exempt from this
             rule.  You will learn what you can and cannot wear as you
             progress through the game. Failure to abide by these rules will
             result in the inability to perform most of your vital skills
             and will for the most part render you powerless.
