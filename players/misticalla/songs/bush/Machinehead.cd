Breathe in, breathe out
Tied to a wheel, fingers got to feel
I spin on a whim, I slide to the right
I felt you like electric light
For our love
For our fear
for our rise against the years and years and years

got a machinehead better than the rest
green to red machinehead
and I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine

deaf, dumb, and thirty
starting to deserve this
leaning on my conscience wall
blood is like wine
Unconscious all the time
If i had it all again
I'd change it all
