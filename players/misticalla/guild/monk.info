 THE MONKS:

 Hija, this report here should give a bit more info about this guild
 and its features. I seriously studied it and gave the skills points
 from * to ****** depending how useful they are:

 1.) Multiattacks: *****

     Multiattacks are very useful and a very monkslike feature.
     The number of attacks depends on your dex.

 2.) Aikido: ***

     Aikido is quite nice. It's a kind of fightingstyle to avoid
     some damage. All in all it's weak, but really worth to use 
     it.

 3.) Feet: ****

     Feet is an additional attack with the foot. It's very monkslike
     and all in all its free. Feet can be done 1 time any round.

 4.) Cure: ****

      Curing with herbs is monklike and very useful althought a player
      cant cure herself during the fight.

 5.) Choke: *

      Choke a kind of infight. It's weak and not very monkslike. I 
      personally would only use it when i am full with power.

 7.) Smash: ***

       Smash is the way to hit the victims head with the knee. A 
       sucessful smash can make the victim unconscious for one to
       two rounds. Unless it's a very weak attack. Well, its more  
       monklike than choke.

 8.) Death: **
     
       Death is the strongest attack of the monk. Which simulates
       somehow the power of critical hitting. It's an art of all
       out attack where you run through the weapons of your victim,
       to give her a strong blow. Well, it's maybe useful for fast
       killing, a bit monklike, but not worth the risc and the costs.

 9.) Springleap: ***

       Springleap is the feature to jump high in the air and hit more
       than one opponent in one round. It's very monkslike but costs
       lots of power and is very weak. After all it's useful to get
       rid of many small enemies.

 10.) Rescue: **

      It's a generel fighter feature. It's useful when the blocker is
      down with health, so that you can move in front of her. It's a   
      very nice feature in a party.

 11.) Disarm: **

      Disarm is the feature to grab the opponent weapon. It is dexterity
      depending and very monkslike. But mostly you will not need this
      feature in a combat.     

 12.) Recall: ***

      Recall is a feature to write a kind of cleric scroll. That's sure    
      monkslike, because monks are a kinda cleric too. It's useful to      
      write such a scroll, before exploring unknown areas.

 13.) Consider: **  
      
      Consider is a great feature to check if the victim might be stronger
      than you. But after all it's more a general feature any player should
      have.

 14.) Pentagram: **

      Pentagram is a kind of holy symbol, build by the monk herself.
      It needs a lot of power to build it, but has the advantage to
      spend light. With giving a pentagram to another player, you allow
      her to enter your guild. All in all it's useful, but not even more
      worth than a torch and a box of matches.

 15.) Mood: ****

       Mood is the great feature to change the combat style of a monk.
       A defensive mood means less attacks but a better dodge. The right
       mood against the right monster is a real advantage. But it's a 
       feature any figher like guild should have.

 16.) Natural armour and weapon: *****

       This feature is very useful especially on high levels. To fight
       barehanded with not much or only light armour is very monklike.
       Besides that monks can wear:
                                    -rings
                                    -cloaks
                                    -amulets
                                    -robes     and 
                                    -boots
      
 17.) Mind Transfer (mt): *

       This feature is a kind of Psychonic feature. Well, Psychonic
       features are somehow monkslike. It's like a tell but a bit
       cheaper. All in all it's nice, but only another form of tell.     

 18.) Meditate: *****

       This is a typical monkfeature. It's very useful, but maybe a pity
       that not only monks do have it. Meditate is the feature to heal 
       faster so most of your commands are blocked during meditation.

 19.) Hide: **
    
       Hide is more a thief feature, but a feature of rangers and monks
       too. The hide of a monk is not as good as the thiefhide, but still
       useful when you have to pass a lot of aggressive hard monsters.

 20.) Monkey: *

       Monkey is the guildemote of the monks. It's not a real monklike
       feature but it's a kind of fun and forces the guildcommunication.
