LEGENDS:

The name legends comes from the mighty elf kings, who once killed
the evil Sauron. One of them was Mithrandir or Gandalf as the none
elfen races called him.
Legends are true hearoes with extremly high powers. A Legendlevels
can only be gained as mortal when she fulfills following purposes:

    1.) She is very experienced:    Experience above 3000000
    2.) Enough points to advance  

If these points are ok you can goto your guild and type 'advance legend'.
To see the levels which are possible and the exp you need, just type
'help legendlevels'. 

The advantage of a Legend is the honor, the greater power and
the lower costs for many abilities. This will raise with each
Legendlevel you get. With the command 'monk legends' you find
out which legends are online. 

With the command 'accept' <playername> Legends and Guildmembers
over level 15 can allow other races, (even if not human, but no
giant, orc or troll) to join your guild.
