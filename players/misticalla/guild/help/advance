ADVANCE:
   To advance as monk you need to have combat and questexperience.
   Then any 2 levels you have to win a heroic fight, before you 
   really can advance. When you are ready to advance, you can see
   it in your upper line when there is a *.

  For example, when you see:

            <Your Name> in HOLY MISSION (you can't advance yet)
       but if you see:
            <Your Name> in HOLY MISSION* (you can advance!)
