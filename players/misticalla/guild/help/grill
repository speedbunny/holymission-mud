COMMAND:
   grill <name of corpse> (when fresh)

ART:
  grilling means to slice out a piece of meat of a slayed
  living. Afterwards you make a nice barbeque to get a 
  grilled slice. With 'eat slice' you can satiate your
  hunger then. Grill works on 'any corpse', without undeads.
  

EXAMPLE:
  grill big fat sheep (when there is a corpse of big fat sheep)
