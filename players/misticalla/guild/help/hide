   hide 

ART:
   Monks are throughout their high speed able to make a fast
   hide, so that noone can see you. The hide is far not
   as effective than the hide of a thief, but can be useful
   if you don't want your victim to see you. (first attack)
   If you try to hide you never will know if you are really
   hidden.
   With unhide you stop hiding.
