Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him, in any amusement hall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid, sure plays a mean pin ball!

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean.
He plays by intuition, the digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid, sure plays a mean pin ball !

He's a pin ball wizard, there has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard, s'got such a supple wrist. 
He ain't got no distractions, can't hear those buzzers and bells.
Don't see lights a flashin', plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay, 'n' never tilts at all.
That deaf dumb and blind kid, sure plays a mean pin ball.

I thought I was The Bally table king, but I just handed my pin ball crown to him.
Even my usual table, he can beat my best. 
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid, sure plays a mean pin ball!
