Marky got with Sharon,
Sharon got Cherise.
She was sharin Sharon's outlook
on the topic of disease.
Mikey had a facial scar,
Bobby was a rapist,
They were all in love with dyin,
They were doin it in Texas.

Tommy played piano like a kid out in the rain,
and then he lost his leg in Dallas,
He was dancin with a train.
They were all in love with dyin,
They were drinking from a fountain,
That was pouring like an avalanche,
Coming down the mountain.

I don't mind the sun sometimes,
The images it shows,
I can taste you on my lips,
and smell you in my clothes.
Cinnamon and sugary and softly spoken lies,
You never know just how ya look,
In other people's eyes.

Some will die in hot pursuit,
and firey auto crashes.
Some will die in hot pursuit,
While sifting through my ashes.
Some will fall in love with life,
and drink it from a fountain,
That is pouring like an avalanche,
Coming down the mountain.

I don't mind the sun sometimes,
The images it shows,
I can taste you on my lips,
and smell you in my clothes.
Cinnamon and sugary and softly spoken lies,
You never know just how you look
in other people's eyes.

Another Marky took a knife,
for arguing in traffic.
Flipper died a natural death,
he caught a nasty virus,
The there was the everpresent
football player rapist,
They were all in love with dyin,
they were doin it in Texas.
Paulie caught a bullet,
but it only hit his leg,
Well it shoulda been a better shot,
and got him in the head.
They were all in love with dyin,
They were drinking from a fountain,
That was pouring like an avalanche,
Coming down the mountain.

I don't mind the sun sometimes,
the images it shows.
I can taste you on my lips,
and smell you in my clothes.
Cinnamon and sugary and softly spoken lies,
You never know just how you look,
In other people's eyes.
