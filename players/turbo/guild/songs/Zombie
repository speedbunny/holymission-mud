Another head hangs lowly,
Child is slowly taken,
And the violence caused such silence,
Who are we mistaken?

But you see it's not me,
It's not my family,
In your head,
In your head,
They are fighting,
With their tanks, and their bombs,
And their bombs, and their guns,
In your head,
In your head they are cryin'
In your head,
Zombie
What's in your head,
In your head,
Zombie

Another mothers' breaking'
Heart is taking over.
When the violence causes silence,
Life must be mistaken.
It's the same old theme since 1916,
In your head,
In your head,
They're still fightin'
With their tanks
In your head,
they are dyin'.

In your head,
In your head,
Zombie,
What's in your head,
In your head,
Zombie.
