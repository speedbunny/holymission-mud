excuse me but can I be you for a while
My DOG won't bite if you sit real still
I got the anti-Christ in the kitchen yellin'at me again
Yeah I can hear that

Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say you know but NOTHING comes
Yes I know what you think of me you never shut up
Yeah I can hear that

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
Cause sometimes I said sometimes I hear my voice and it's been
HERE silent all these years

So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deap thoughts
Boy you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you

My scream got lost in a paper cup
You think there's a heaven where screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker do you think its enough
To get us there

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
Cause sometimes I said sometimes I hear my voice and it's been
HERE silent all these years

Years go by will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand
Years go by if I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds raining in my head
Years go by will I choke on my tears
Till finally there is nothing left
One more casualty
You know we're to EASY easy easy

Well I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now but baby don't look up
The sky is falling

Your MOTHER shows up in a nasty dress
It's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody lookin'at you here take hold of my hand
Yeah I can hear them

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
Cause sometimes I said sometimes I hear my voice
I hear my voice
I hear my voice
And it's been HERE silent all these years
I've been here silent all these years
Silent all these 
Silent all these years
