And the men who hold high places,
Must be the ones who start,
To mould a new reality,
Closer to the Heart.

The Blacksmith and the Artist,
Reflect it in their art,
Forge their creativity,
Closer to the Heart.

Philosophers and Ploughmen,
Each must know his part,
To sow a new mentality,
Closer to the Heart.

You can be the Captain,
I will draw the chart,
Sailing into destiny,
Closer to the Heart.
