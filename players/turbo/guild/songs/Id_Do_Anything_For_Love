Meatloaf - I'D DO ANYTHING FOR LOVE (BUT I WONT DO THAT)

And I would do anything for love, 
I'd run right into hell and back, 
I would do anything for love, 
I'll never lie to you and thats a fact.

But I'll never forget the way you feel right now 
- Oh no - no way - I would do anything for love, 
But I wont do that, I wont do that, anything for love, 
I would do anything for love, I would do anything for love, 
But I wont do that, I wont do that.


	Some days it dont come easy,
	Some days it dont come hard
	Some days it dont come at all,
	And these are the days that never end.

	Some nights you breath fire,
	Some nights your carved in ice,
	Some nights your like nothing I've ever seen before, Or will again.

	Maybe Im crazy, But it's crazy and it's true,
	I know you can save me, No one else can save me now but you.

	    As long as the planets are turning,
	    As long as the stars are burning,
	    As long as your dreams are coming true - You better believe it! -

	    That I would do anything for love,
	And I'll be there until the final act - 
	I would do anything for love!
And I'll take a Vow and Seal a pact -

But I'll never forgive myself if we dont go all the way - Tonight -
I would do anything for love! 
I would do anything for love,
I would do anything for love,
But I wont do that, I wont do that...

	I would do anything for love, 
Anything you've been dreaming of, 
But I just wont do that...

    Some days I pray for Silence, 
Some days I pray for Soul,
Some days I just pray to the God of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll.

Some nights I lose the feeling,
Some nights I lose control,
Some nights I just lose it all when I watch you dance and the thunder rolls.

Maybe I'm lonely, And thats all I'm qualified to be,
There's just one and only, The one and only promise I can keep.

As long as the wheels are turning,
As long as the fires are burning,
As long as your prayers are coming true - You better believe it - !

That I would do anything for love!
And you know it's true and thats a fact,
I would do anything for love! 
And there'll never be no turning back -

But I'll never do it better than I do it with you, 
	So long - So long - I would do anything for love,
I would do anything for love, 
I would do anything for love,
I would do anything for love,
But I wont do that, I wont do that!

	I would do anything for love,
Anything you've been dreaming of,
But I just wont do that...

    But I'll never stop dreaming of you
    Everynight of my life - No Way -

    I would do anything for love, 
I would do anything for love,
I would do anything for love,
But I wont do that, I wont do that!

	Girl  : Will you raise me up? 
	Will you help me down?
	Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town?
	Will you make it a little less cold?

	Boy   : I can do that!
	    I can do that!

		Girl  : Will you hold me sacred?
		will you hold me tight?
		Can you colorize my life I'm so sick of black and white?
		Can you make it a little less old?

		Boy   : I can do that!
		    I can do that!

			Girl  : Will you make me some magic, with your own two hands?
			Can you build an Emerald city with these grains of sand?
			Can you give me something that I can take home?

			Boy   : I can do that!
			    I can do that!

				Girl  : Will you cater to every fantasy that I've got?
				Will ya hose me down with holy water - if I get too hot - ?
Will you take me to places that I've never known?

Boy   : I can do that!
    I can do that!

	Girl  : After a while you'll forget everything,
It was a brief interlude, And a midsummer night's fling,
And you'll see that it's time to move on.

Boy   : I wont do that!
    I wont do that!

	Girl  : I know the territory - I've been around,
	It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down,
	And sooner or later you'll be screwing around.

	Boy   : I wont do that!
	    I wont do that!

		Anything for love, I would do anything for love,
I would do anything for love,
But I wont do that, I wont do that.
