God Money,
I'll do anything for you.
God Money,
Just tell me what you want me to.
God Money,
Nail me up against the wall.
God Money,
Don't want everything he wants it all.

No you can't take it.
No no you can't take it.
(No you can't take that away from me).

Head like a hole,
Black as your soul,
I'd rather die than give you control.
Head like a hole,
Black as your soul,
I'd rather die than give you control.

Bow down before the one you serve,
You're going to get what you deserve.

God Money's
Not looking for the cure.
God Money's
Not concerned about the sick among the pure.
God Money,
Let's go dancing on the backs of the bruised.
God Money's
Not one to choose.
No you can't take it.
No no you can't take it.
No you can't take that away from me.

Head like a hole,
Black as your soul,
I'd rather die than give you control.
Head like a hole,
Black as your soul,
I'd rather die than give you control.

Bow down before the one you serve.
You're going to get what you deserve.
