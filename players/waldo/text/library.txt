                          KEIDALL PUBLIC LIBRARY
                         We love to discriminate!

	Our library contains over 20000 volumes. We have spent a long time
building up our collection, and we don't want just ANYONE reading our precious
books. Therefore, only five books are made available for foreigners. The 
selection changes periodically, so be sure to check back! And don't soil our
books or we will have to deal with you in our own manner!
