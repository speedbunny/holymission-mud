This is the dir that holds all the help-files :-)
should be of the format
Spell : <Name of spell>
Cost  : <self-explanatory>
Level : Level required
Desc  : SHORT! Description of spell denoting what it does
DMG   : Damage done (based on what stat and rule)

eg
Spell : magic missile
Cost  : 30sp
Level : 1
Desc  : Shoots a Magical bolt of energy from (1-10) fingertips
DMG   : ( (level/2)+1 ) * ( ( (int*wis) /2 ) +5 )

Note : the above is only an example of what to do :-)
