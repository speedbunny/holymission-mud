DETAIL

This is a command that gives all information about a given item. This costs
20 spellpoints, you must wear the brooch and be nice or better (these are
the standard requirements for a Bard). The command tries to find out every
single detail about an object, except if it's an instrument (it'll not detail
instruments, since you're supposed to find them out yourself). It's a very
powerful command. If you find an object that's not detailed correctly, or
isn't detailed as you would have, use the maybe command.
