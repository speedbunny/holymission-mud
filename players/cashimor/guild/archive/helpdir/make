MAKE

The make command makes an instrument you can use, IF:

* You have 10 spellpoints, although difficult instruments might take more
* You wear your harp
* You are nice or better
* You have the items of which you want to make the instrument

If you don't have the items, you will lose the spellpoints, but you're told
what the next item is you need to build the instrument. It is wise to drop 
all objects except the ones you want to make the instrument with, because 
important items could be destroyed. If you have got the first item, but you
haven't got the next, you lose the first item in the spell.

Instruments can have special abilities when played (depends on level too), 
and can be hidden with 'hide' command and found again by the 'search' 
command.

This is the most powerful ability of the Guild of Bards. Use it wisely.
