RESTORE

This command restores your spellpoints. This costs a powerpoint from the
brooch. At the beginning of the game the brooch has no power, so you can't
use this option then. But after 45 minutes (if you're wearing it that is)
the brooch will blink, displaying there's power to restore your spellpoints
once. You don't need to do this, the number is kept in the brooch, but when
you quit all powerpoints will be lost. The increase of powerpoints depends
on your level. This command doesn't check on alignment, but you must wear
the harp to be able to use it.
