Welcome, Bard, to your profession. Being a Bard, you gain several interesting
abilities, about which I'll give you a short description here. At least two 
things must be remembered however: most abilities depend on you being good 
natured, and not every ability of the Bard is contained in this document. 
Further help can be asked about the abilities by typing 'help' followed by 
the ability you want help on. As a Bard, you won't be able to cast the 
standard spells (missile, shock, fireball) anymore.

DETAIL   - For information on an object.
MAKE     - To make an instrument.
MAYBE    - To give ideas for the Guild.
HELP     - To gain insight in the usage of these commands.
PRETITLE - To change or give yourself a pretitle.
SING     - Sings a song out of a collection of songs.
RESTORE  - To restore your spellpoints, if there's power in the brooch.
SONGS    - Gives a list of possible songs.
CHANGELOOK- To give yourself a new appearance.

I hope you enjoy it. And know that the Guild of Bards isn't made for those
who want to become wizard quickly, but for those who want to enjoy the game
and know more about it... The real adventurers...

Taliesin.
