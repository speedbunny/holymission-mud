SING

With this command you can sing a song of a list of songs. This song will,
if you wear the brooch, have at least 5 spellpoints and you are nice or
better, heard to a certain distance around you. It can be used for creating
an atmosphere. The name of the song is Case Sensitive, and if the command
fails the ordinary sing command will take over. A list of songs
can be asked by using the SONGS command.
