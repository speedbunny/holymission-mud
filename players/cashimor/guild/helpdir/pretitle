PRETITLE

With this command you can set your pretitle. This is a short piece of text
before your name. To make a pretitle you have to wear your brooch, have 30
spellpoints and be nice or better. If you don't want any pretitle anymore, 
use 'pretitle none'. And please use this command sensibly, because if it's 
misused, it might be needed to remove it entirely and give all persons preset 
pretitles.
