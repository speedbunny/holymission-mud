MANUAL FOR THE water.c INHERITANCE

INTRODUCTION

Water.c is the first inheritance using hostile.c.
It makes it possible for players to drown, and
objects to float down, and torches to extinguish.

USAGE

Use water.c as you would use a room, but insert
a ::reset(arg) in the reset(arg). Then change
the following (if needed):
1) The monsters: they need a 'set_has_gills()',
   to allow them to breathe underwater.
2) Surface waters: nodanger=1 (you can breathe
   at the surface).
3) Parts of water above other parts:
   floats="filename of water below this level",
   to let objects float down in the water.
4) Make something that allows breathing under
   water. Give it a TEMPORARY nature, please, no
   objects with which you can breathe everywhere
   for always. These objects should have id
   "allows_breathing".

Simple, isn't it?
