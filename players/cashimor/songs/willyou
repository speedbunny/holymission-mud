You drink your coffee and I sip my tea
And we're sitting here playin' so cool
Thinking what will be, will be
What's kin kind of late now
I wonder if you'll stay now, stay now, stay now
Or will you just politely - say good night.
I move a little closer to you
Not knowing right what to do
And I'm feeling of things as in dance
I spill my tea - oh silly me.
What's ...
And then we touch, much to much
This moment has been waiting for a long, long time
Some shiver makes me quiver
This moment I am so unsure
This moment I have waited for
It's something you've been waiting for too
Take up your eyes, bare your soul
Gather me to you and make me oh ...
Tell me the secret, sing me the song
Sing it to me in the silent dawn.
What's ...
