When I was a child
I dreamed like a child of wonder
With my back in the grass
My eyes to the sky to see
I believed in the stars
I knew they cast a spell that I was under
With my fingers in the dirt
I was part of the earth
Every living thing was part of me
But it's gone, it's gone
It's gone, it's gone, gone
I can't feel it
I can't feel it
Must've found a way out my back door
Must've run away out my back door
Because it's gone, gone, gone
