Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall's calling, it lingers then you forget
You're a rock'n'roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past the cafe' but you don't eat when you've lived too long
You're a rock'n'roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk floats ride your mind
So natural -- religiously unkind
Oh no love! You're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up but if I could only make you care
Oh no love! you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when are where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share so I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone just turn on with me
You're not alone let's turn on and be
You're not alone gimme your hands
You're wonderful gimme your hands
You're wonderful gimme your hands
