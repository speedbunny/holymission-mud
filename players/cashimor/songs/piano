It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Making love to his tonic and gin
He says "Son can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes,
but it's sad and it sweet and I knew it 
complete when I were a younger man's clothes."
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
We're all in the mood for a melody 
and you've got us feeling alright
