tmp_text "I vote no ... I hope what you guys are doing to us here in RL ?I cant think I would like to discuss with Helenette about Mud related stuff,because she is a woman who really smells bad from here mouth andwashes herself rarely .....Oh well .... Herp**I vote yes because Helenette reputedly has a good knowledge of programmingand because she could contribute to the MUD if she had a chance to. Keepingher at level 29 forever won't solve anything, but if she is allowed to wizit could be a move everyone could profit from. I know that it is easy forme to cast this vote without having seen (or smelled) her, but I still thinkthat she dereves a fair chance.-Silas**I dont want the FETTE HELENETTE in this MUD !NO NO NO NO NO NO !!!Wolfi !**I think itisnt fair to banish her all the time**I DO want Helenette to become wiz. Physical features should not influencewhether a player is allowed to wiz or not.If this were the case, you two guys, Dago and Herp, would have to bebanished immediately if that were possible.                                   Zaphod**I vote yes, she has been a player long enough and reputedly can code welland probably could improve the mud in general. Personal life should beexcluded from mud life, if u cant keep it that way you shouldnt play. IfYou dont want to talk to her about something in the mud then tell her, dontbe a biased fool and operate different rules for some players and othersfor other players. Rules are or should be there. If not make them.		Kaz**Diese Abstimmung is der groesste Schwachsinn den ich je gesehen habe !!!Und alleine die note vom WOLFI **laugh** is der ueberhaupt da ????Wie kann man nur so eine SCHEISS idee haben =???Und die note vom herp (gestank) is auch PURER scheiss (so was in nem mudauf einem board)=SPINNST DU HERP ?????Dass der dago wenns um die helenette geht sowieso durchdreht weis ich (quest)Scheiss auf diese Abstimmung !!!!IHR ARSCHLOECHERcapa**Hi !Why not, by the way she is better contollable as 31 er wizthan as 29 player. In fact she is sometimes a bit mad, butI dont see any serious reason to banish her.**I can think of a hell of a lot of people who would (and have done)make worse wizards than her, and I've yet to see anyone give onegood reason as to why she shouldn't be made wiz.Also, the way she has been treated *SUCKS* , in my opinion.                     [*MOONCHILD*]**What a FUCKING idea!!!!!!!!!**who tries to cheat by using other wizards characters???**YES** I still think herp should of done the banishment on his own. its hisown mud, and the word GOD on this mud is trying to indicate that he/shecan do whatever he/she wants to do with his/her damn mud.tomorrow we could all be banished and it'd be ok, cuz its his mud.anyway, i don't want to put up with her once she gets on. but it looks like most people are voting yes, which is ok, cause ifshe messes around, she can still be banished, just like Whisky said.besides, wouldn't she just start over as level 1? Then keep quiet aboutwho she really is, and then wiz, and we'd never know who it really was.go figure. zix**Ok, i could agree  (it seems  that i have to) to  whisky that  its better  tohave a 31 wiz then a bored 29 player.But who the hell told you all that she can code?As  for the  argument that  physical apearence/real life  SHOULD  be kept outof the mud: RIGHT!, but  its a  two-way function  which  means  that she alsoshould not bore other wiz/player physically  outside the mud as she did often enought.The voting  as such  is our try  to keep  quite fair. Voting new wiz is usualin other  muds, i think  we should  establish  it here too. There are 70 wiz-chars in this mud which i think is near the upper limit.Beeing  fair  means, i DON'T just  shoot her out, set her to level 1 or closethe mud at all. Instead i  try to  discuss the problem.  Therefore i really don't  understandcomments like "ARSCHLO
