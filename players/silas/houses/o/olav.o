rooms_desc ({"You are standing on the front porch of Olav and Emily's house.\nIt's a fully restored, two story Victorian farmhouse surrounded\nby immaculate lawn and majestic shade trees.\nTo the northeast, you can see a green, roomy pasture bordered\nby miles of white fencing where Emily's horses are grazing contentedly.\n","Entering the house, you find yourself in a hallway. \nA long, curving staircase leads up to the second floor. As you are being\nhelped out of your coat by your attentive host, you look around and notice\nthat everything is both stylish and practical. You feel that no one\nwould ever ask you not to touch something here.\nAlready you can feel yourself relaxing and feeling at home.\n","You are in a den. As you look around you see that all the\nfurniture was selected for comfort, not fashion. It has to be the\nbest room in the house. Along one wall is a 52\" wide-screen t.v.\nwith surround sound. Next to it is a cabinet with a vcr, sega\nCD system and hundreds of games and movies, including the entire \nDisney collection. On the right is a state-of-the-art stereo with \nmassive speakers. An unmatched CD collection surrounds it. As you\nsink into a reclining chair and put your feet up, you feel like\nyou're home. Obviously, Olav has spared no expense here.\n","This is a swimming pool. It is under construction.\n","Tihs is gonna be the bed-room. Still under construction.\n","This is the kitchen, Emily's pride and joy. You admire the space\nand note that she has every modern convenience. The scent of home\ncooking lingers, causing your mouth to water. A fresh apple pie\ncools on the counter and you long for just a sliver.\nBut just as you reach for a crumb on the counter, a wooden spoon wacks your hand and\nyou see Emily standing there grinning evilly. With a sigh, you turn\nto find comfort elsewhere.\n","You are standing in the nerve center of the house, Olav's\noffice. You stare enviously, realizing this could be a scene from a\nFourtune 500 company. The powerful computer with color lazer printer\nand modem, the fax machine and triple phone lines. From here\nOlav can conduct business world-wide and run his computer company\nwith ease. you smile as you try to picture outdoors loving Emily\nworking here.\n","You have entered the master bathroom. Ahead of you is the\nhuge jacuzzi tub just right for two. To your right is the sink and\nEmily's vanity table neatly cluttered with hair accessories and\njewelry. The scent of her perfume lingers, driving you mad with \ndesire. Past the sink is the toilet. On your way out,\nyou glance down at the marble tiles and remember the solid\nbrass hardware on everything.\n",0,0,})
