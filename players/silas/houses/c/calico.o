rooms_desc ({"This is Calico's little corner of the world. It looks very comfortable.\nThere are pillows everywhere to lie on, and large pretty windows\nto let the sun in. Calico likes to sit in them and watch the people.\n","This is Calico's library. Every wall is covered with bookshelves. \nEven the floor is taken up mostly by lines of more shelves. At the ends\nof some of them are chairs for people to sit in and relax while\nthey browse through the books. You can see that some of Calico's\nfavorites are fantasy and mystery. Sometimes you can catch \nCalico catnapping in one of the chairs. Shhhhhhhhhh.\n","This is Calico's stereo room. There are speakers in all four corners.\nONLY the best brought to you by Bose. The entire west wall houses\nthe stereo system. It contains the best in stereo components.\nThere is a huge white leather couch ensemble in the middle of the room.\nA glass coffee table sits in front of it, with the remote to \nthe whole system sitting on it. There are decorative black metal\nCD towers scattered about the room. Calico likes to listen to all kinds\nof music, but right now some smooth rippin' jazz by the Rippingtons\nis playing on the speakers. YEeeaahhhh.\n","This is another of Calico's libraries. The books, though, are\nall comic books. There is simply one good sized bench in the\nmiddle of the room, next to a big table. The rest of the room\nis filled with shelves of boxes. Most of them are empty, though.\nLooks like Calico has a long way to go on her collections.\n","The room is filled with nothing other than hundreds and hundreds \nof stuffed animals of every kind, shape and size!!!!!\nThe sheer amount boggles the mind.\n","This is Calico's kitchen. It looks like a simple breakfast room.\nThe table is big enough for a cozy meal with friends, and has a\nceramic top for easier cleanup when her rowdier friends get into\nfood fights. There are fresh flowers on the table and the\ncupboards are always full. Help yourself.\n","Calico seems to be full of surprises. There are several instruments\nhere, thought you don't know if she can play them all. A grand\npiano dominates the center of the room. In the southeast corner\na cello sits against a chair small raised platform. Other instruments\nhang from various shelves on the walls, but they don't look like\nthey are used much. The cello seems to be Calico's favorite.\n","Calico loves to go to the movies. This is a small theater with \nsoft, plush theater seats and a big screen covering the south wall.\nThe north wall is a huge window looking out on the garden at\nthe center of Calico's house. There are curtains to close over it\nwhen the movie starts. There's even a popcorn cart in the\nnortheast corner. It's show time.\n","This is a comfortable sitting room. The southeast corner is\nactually a curved bay window with a window seat. There\nare cushioned wicker chairs placed around a glass-topped\nwicker table. It's a good place for a cup an conversation.\n","Calico has a strong taste for futons. There is a king size\nfuton bed, covered with a beautiful hand-made quilt,\nagainst the east wall. A futon chair sits in the northwest\ncorner while a popason loveseat sits in the southwest corner.\nA simple lamp hangs above the futon chair, the only light\nin the entire room. I guess she likes the lights low, hmmmmm?\n",})
