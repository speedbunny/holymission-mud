rooms_desc ({"This is the lavish entry hall to Cara's house.\nA magic archway on the south wall leads back to the earthly world\nand doors lead north, east and west.\nThe room has a bright chandelier in the centre\nand is well lit. The marble and slate finish gives this room\na feeling of elegance.\n","This is a small ornate hallway. There are exits south, to the \nstudy, east, to the bedroom, and west, to the lounge.\nThere are a line of chandeliers lighting this hall, at the\nend is a large window looking out on the Astryl Plains.\nThe famed temple of Isnoss - council hall of the gods is seen\nin the distance. The river Styx flows silently beneath the\nfloor of this extravigant house.\n","This is Cara's bathroom, it is rather small, however highly ornate.\nThere is a toilet and basin on the south wall, and a large 2 person\nshower on the north, a spa bath sits in a glass covet on the east\nwall, and the dim light of the Astryl ring shines in to the room \nthrough the large crystal glass.\nThe room is entirely crafted out of a large marble block, it has seemless walls\nand floors, and finishings are gold.\n","This is a large and elegant room, it is furnished\nin deep burgundy with gold triming. There is a large\nmirrored robe on the south wall, with a door to the bathroom.\nTo the north is a large bay window, with satin drapes.\nThe large comfortable bed sits in the middle of the east wall,\nthe burgundy silk curtains drape its four posts.\nA sky light provides light or a view of the stars to this wonderful room.\n","This is Cara's elaborate study\nIt is furnished in the finest limbe book cases\nand a large ornate oaken deak. A chandelier hangs low \nover the desk, and lights the room well.\nA small lounge sits against the wall.\n","This is an ornate lounge room with the finest furniture\nimaginable. You could almost swear the gods made this room.\nThe decorations are intricate and perfect to the last detail\nas if the materials grew just to form this furniture.\nA set of large lounge chairs and a small cabinet decorate\nthe room.\n","A large and well used kitchen - Cara likes\nto cook. The room is imaculate and tidy tho, and some of the\nappliances look like nothing you have ever seen before.\nYou think they must be from distant lands or other worlds.\n","A large dining room. The table looks long enough to hold a feast\nand probably has had a few. The room is well lit with candles\nlined up down the table centre in a perfect line.\nThe teak table and chairs are as ornate as the lounge furniture.\n","THE TEMPLE OF ISNOSS\nThe view from here is Magnificent, the whole world stretches \nout beneath it.\n","This is a small chamber. Statues of a Bird, a Cat, a Griffon and \na large armour clad Knight stand silently before a small alter.\nA single candle burns at the alter.\nOn the alter is a circle of strange symbols, as you look \nclosely you notice the top symbol is that of Cara's family.\nAnd the symbols of Zeus, Nicademus and Awran are near it.\n",})
