The main thing that strikes you about it, is\nit is lined with bookshelves, all crammed full with books.  You get the \nidea that the Lady Cookie like to read.  Also, there are several exotic\nplants, the likes of which you have never seen before.  There are a few\nAfrican wall hangings which finishes the room prefectly.\nYou feel peaceful as you wander aimlessly to the next room....\n","You walk into a large spacious Biscuit Barrel.  The walls are made of\nold oak and still have the air and feel of the trees from which they\nwere made.  The room although sparse with furniture, is filled with\nstrange and exotic biscuits from all around the world.  The walls are\nladen with paintings of all the Cookie's, whom can be trace back to the\nDawn of Time.  There are numerous bookshelves filling the walls, all of\nwhich are stacked full of different books on interesting topics.  The\ntables are littered with open scrolls, parchments, and maps, which \nleaves you thinking that she must be planning something.\nAs the thought enters your head, you suddenly feel as though you're\nnot alone......just then Something steps into view, making you silent\nwith fear.  Whatever IT is, it starts towards you....\n","This is Jem's room. As you look around you notice the walls are\nmade from old stone.  Each stone hand cut from the oldest Dwarf\nquarry's.  The center of the north wall is dominated by a large\nmarble fireplace. It has a chearful, dancing fire burning in it,\nan you can hear it peacefully crackling. On the east wall is a \nvery large window, which allows to to look out into Cookie's\ngarden.  It is framed by large red velvet curtains, which are\ntied back with lengths of golden cord.  Just under the window \nthere is an aged oak window seat, with many cushions scattered\nover it. As you continue looking, you see the floor has been\npolished, and you can still smell the bee's wax in the air.\nIt has been covered in the finest Persian rugs known to man.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,})
