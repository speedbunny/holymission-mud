rooms_desc ({"This is Copperhead's living room. There is a large lounge in the centre of the\nroom. It faces a large entertainment system that sits on the north wall.\nThis entertainment system is comprised of a large television set, a video, \na dual cassette player, 2 10-stack CD players, a huge Yamaha amplifier, and\n3 sets of HUGE speakers. There is a room off to the west. There is an\nadvertisement poster on the east wall.\n","This is Dawn and Copperhead's bedroom. Because Copperhead and Dawn have not\nbeen married very long, there is only a hint of a woman's touch. In the centre of\nthis very large room is a pit, filled with pillows. On the eastern wall, there \nis a queen sized waterbed, which is covered by a patchwork quilt. On the \nNorthern wall, you can see some inbuilt cupboards. The southern wall houses \nDawn and Copperhead's bar. This bar contains many refreshing and intoxicating\ndrinks. On the ceiling you see one of the most beautiful and ornate chandeliers\never. The floor is covered with fur rugs.\n","This is Copperhead's computer room. He has the very best of equipment in this\nroom. Sitting on top of a large desk is a computer, and there are two speakers\nleading out of the back of the computer. Sitting next to the computer is a \nprinter, which takes up over a quarter of the total area of the desk. Behind the \ndesk is an adjustable hydraulic chair. The walls have been painted with a nice\npastel blue paint. On the east wall is a picture.\n","This is Dawn's bit, where she is free to do what she wants.\n","This is the room where Copperhead stores many things he would not like the \noutside world to see. In this room, there are rows and rows of storage shelves.\nOn these shelves, there are many cases of a very fine and expensive malt\nscotch, many bags full of dried ganja, and literally thousands of cartons of \nbeer. On the eastern wall there is an open cupboard. There is a sign directly\nin front of you as you enter.\n",0,0,0,0,0,})
