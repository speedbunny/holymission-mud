rooms_desc ({"This is the parlor of Cavalier's humble home.  This is the room in which he\nholds general conversations with friends and visitors.  This also the room\nin which he holds his parties.  Along the east side of the room, there is\na large black velvet futon chair.  To the right of that there sits a \nlarge over-stuffed chair covered in the like.  In the middle of the\nroom sits a large, but sturdy coffee table.  Along the west side of\nthe room sits a large, comfortable, black leather couch.  It looks VERY\ninviting.  On both ends of the couch, there sits large sturdy end tables\nwhich match the coffee table.  Along the north wall sits a large e      \nentertainment center whcih features a multi-disc CD changer and big\nscreen tv.  It also contains a large number of cd racks, filled with \nKansas, Queen, Clannad, Enya, U2, Midnight Oil and \nother spectacular groups.  This system also features two 5 foot \nInfinity tower speakers and various amps.  The floor is covered by a\nfabulously plush, light blue, shag carpet that looks inviting enough to\nlie down and sleep on, along with other various activities.  It looks\nvery expensive.  From the ceiling there are various hanging plants,\nconsisting mainly of ivys.  Over all, this is a very inviting room.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is Cavalier's master bedroom.  It is very tastefully decorated\nwith very masterful reproductions of such classic artworks as the Mona\nLisa, as well as other works by the Masters.  The center of the room is\ndominated by a super king water bed, which is covered by black silk sheets\nand comforters.  The floor is again covered by a VERY inviting, super-plush\nshag carpet.  However, despite the obvious comforts of this room, there is\na sadness about it.  It's as if something, or someone, who once graced\nthis room is now gone.  Not only from the room, but from Cavalier's life.\nIt is almost an uncomfortable, saddening feeling that would proably \ndistress most visitors to this room.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
