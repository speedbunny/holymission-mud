Tropic trees everywhere, small colorful birds flying between them. You hear sounds of a waterfall to the east, and you smell the scent of tropic flowers. A small trail leads east.\n","You cover your ears, the sound of falling water is almost unbearable. The\nfine mist in the air drenches your completely. The water gathers into a\npool, the southern bank of the pool is covered with water-roses. The water\nis so crystal-clear, that you can see the rocks lying on the ground, deep\nunder the surface.\nNot far from the roses is a little clearing, covered with soft green grass.\nThe trail leads towards the clearing.\n","As you step into the soft grass you realize that this small protected clearing\nis a piece of heaven. A soft breeze cools the hot air down a bit, you have an\nurge to lie down right now ... you close your eyes and listen to the\nwaterfall, the sound of rushing water makes you sleepy.\n","You see big mountains looming before you. A small mountain path leads toward the top of the highest mountain, but you cant recognize what's up there. The fresh clear air refreshes your lungs. Big old pines are standing here, you have to jump over smaller rocks to proceed toward the top.\n",".[1mNAME.[m\n",})
