You notice the arrangements of flowers and smell their\nsweet aroma.\n\n","This is the main hall.  It is very wide, and has high cielings, you wonder\nwhy it didn't look like this from the outside, the interior is unique.\nThere are large ancient pillars lining the hall, three on each side.\nThere are large comfortable chairs and sofas to sit on, beautiful\ntables with various objects on them, and plants scattered about the room.\nYou notice the living space to the east, the kitchen to the west,\nand a large door to the north.\n\n","This is a bedroom.
