The lawn is neat and green and well cared for. The door is a heavy, polished  slab of the finest mahogany you have ever seen. There is a little bench on the porch, as well as a rocking  chair. Lying obediently at the stairs is Cody's dog, Murphy, who waits patiently for her Mistress. \n","The foyer of Cody's house is bright and inviting, lit well by the skylight\nand big windows on either side of the door. The floors are polished wood, \ncovered with an old-fashioned braided rug. Plants are artfully arranged at\nthe windows. Cody's favourite plant, the English ivy, dominates the room, \nin a big pot hanging from the ceiling. Its vines drape down and wrap around\nthe window sill. In the other corner, a antique mirror hangs on the wall.\nYou already feel at home here.\n","You've stepped into a bright and airy sitting room. All around there are \nshiny windows that let in a beautiful scenery of mountains, hills and\ntrees. For privacy, there are shades of soft pastel colours. There is a \ntan wicker sofa with matching chairs and tables sitting around.\nOn the wall without windows, there are many pictures. Some are of Cody's \ndog, Murphy, but most are of Cody and her husband whom she adores. Beneath\nyour feet is a soft sky blue plush rug, and one wall of windows\nis a veritable forest of plants. You get the feeling that Cody\nis a lover of living things, plants and animals, as the HUGE aquarium \nthat sits diagonally in the corner proves. \n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
