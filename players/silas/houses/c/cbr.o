rooms_desc ({"This is Cbr's house, a single spartan room with only the barest concessions\nto comfort.  A thin mattress lies on the stone floor, and against the far\nwall is a large table piled high with various magical devices, potions,\nscrolls, and other arcane items.  The room is lit by a blue glow from the\nceiling and walls.\n","You are standing on a small strip of sand, nestled between a rocky\ncliff face behind you and the rythmic sounds of surf to the north.\nThere is a light breeze blowing off the sea, cool without being cold,\nand the scent of the ocean fills your senses.  It is nighttime here,\nand moonlight illuminates the area with a soft blue light.  To the \nnorth you see streaks of white and purple where phosphorescent sea\ncreatures mix with the foam of breaking waves.  The sand beneath your\nfeet is soft and white and still carries the warmth of the past day's\nsunlight.  To the south, the cliff wall rises into the low clouds,\nunbroken except for a curious shimmering portal at the base.\n","A short swim has taken you out to this small island, invisible from\nthe mainland.  The island appears to have been volcanic at one point\nin the distant past, and the sand is composed of pumice and lava, long\nsince ground to a fine powder by the action of the waves.  Magma deep\nbelow still heats the sand to a comfortable temperature, contrasting \nwith the chilly ocean wind which blows unhindered over the island.\nAll around you the surf crashes against the island, reminding you of\nthe vastness of nature and her untamed forces.  Above, the stars shine\nlike diamonds on black velvet, and the moon nestles in one corner,\nlighting the island with a faint blue glow.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
