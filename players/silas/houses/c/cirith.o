All of the windows are boarded up, and there\nis a sign on the door that reads 'Closed'.\n","After knocking the secret passcode, you are quickly slipped inside of the\nbuilding.  The inside of the building appears to be much better condition\nthen the outside would lead you to believe.  Another small sign here\nthat catches your attention.\n","This is the main hall of the Den.  Many thieves are lounging here,\ntrading tips and information, stories of great exploits, and\ntheories of how to rob the bank of Holy Mission.  There are several\nchoices of tables and bean-bag chairs to pick from, but you\nthink of your coins and reconsider staying in this room too long.\n","You stand in a medium sized kitchen, which appears to be very well\nequiped with many large cabinets with full stocks of incredably\nexpensive foods.  The Den cook is furiously preparing dinner for\nCirith and his guests.\n","The dining room has an incredably large table set in the middle of it,\nwith finely crafted wooden chairs lining around the edges.  Many\ncabinets are also against the wall, holding beautiful china and\nsilverware.  The smell of food drifts from the north.\n","Many strange models, practice dummies, lock-picks, locks and other\nitems with less obvious uses are in this room.  There are several\nthieves here, practicing skills and making wagers on the people\nworking with the equipment.\n","This is the safe room that Cirith stores his personal equipment in.\nOnly he may enter this room!\n",0,0,0,})
