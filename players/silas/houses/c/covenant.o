It has been a long time since rains last fell here and the hills are covered in dead brown grass. The sky is a dark grey colour however and the smell of rain is in the air.\n","At this point the plains end in a sheer rock wall which rises vertically up into the sky. The wall is made of a smooth black rock which appears to glisten wetly in the grey half-light of the storm clouds overhead. It extends in a north south direction as far as you can see with no visible hand or footholds. There is however a portal in the rockface. It is covered in a transparent white shield which pulses and throbs as you look at it. The ground here is barren and dusty. There is no plant life of any sort visible anywhere. You realise that since entering the area you have seen no animals either.\n","This is a large flat area. To your south you can see where the hills smooth out and merge with plains on which you now stand. The clouds are thick and heavy above this place, almost as if drawn here by some mystic force. To the east a small creek snakes through the landscape - the only feature on an otherwise featureless area. Sitting on the plain in front of you is a small house made of rough cut logs.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.

An underground lake starts to the north and continues on into the darkness. Attached to the walls near the entrance are two globes of light which hang above the area where you stand. The floor of this cavern is also polished smooth as if from the constant grinding of some great body but it is of a more normal rock than that of the walls outside. You sense the presence of an ancient evil.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
