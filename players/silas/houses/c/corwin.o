rooms_desc ({"You stand in a comfortably large room decorated primarilyin shades of black, silver, and gray.  This is the foyerof Corwin, Prince of Amber's house.  A strangely-craftedsilver coat rack stands to one side, and luxuriouscouches upholstered in gray satin stand opposite eachother across the room.  There are no doors; however,various magical linkages exist that will lead you toother places.  You sense links such as these in a mirror,a sword, the north wall, a rug, and a candelabra.","This is Corwin of Amber's bedroom.  Black dominates thedecor even more than in the foyer, making the occasionalsilver accoutrement that much more of a contrast.  Theroom is dominated by a large four-poster waterbed, thoughvarious other common furnishings are present, such as adresser, closet, and nightstand.","This is Corwin's sitting room.  It is lit with severalcandles and furnished with a wide variety of chairs, fromCorwin's huge, ornate wing-chair through a small couch, alarge bean-bag, and a wicker chair suspended from theceiling.  Music of widely divergent and rapidly shiftingstyles plays softly in the background, emanating from anunseen source.","You enter Corwin's garden of energies.  This place isobviously part of another dimension, and one highlymagical at that.  Spirits whirl and dance through thedweomer-laden air; abstract spell constructs hover inplace; complex structures of interweaving elementalforces shift and weave.  You move through this placeon small platforms of yellow light that materializeunder your feet wherever you step.","As you proceed, the motif of the displays changes.Where the magical art was previously oriented towardimpressive displays of abstract beauty and power,these constructs seek to subtly express human emotions.The range of feelings present is impressive in itself;displays exist for everything from such basics as loveand hate to esoterica such as appreciation of the tragicand introspective reaction to the psyche-altering effectsof power.  Dominant over all the rest, though, are theextremely intricate yet heartrendingly simple displaysrepresenting love.  Locked in the heart of these constructsis the part of this place most sacred to Corwin, hisprivate sanctuary of the soul.  For him to allow someoneinto that place would be to show that person the innermost treasures of his heart.","This place, shielded in the heart of Corwin'sgarden of emotions, consists of three simplestructures.  The first is a magical constructof curving blue lines of force, constructed sothat one may recline in it to regard the othertwo constructs.  These are lifelike magicalmodels of a pair of women, whose paradoxicallysimple names burn into your mind: Liz and Wendy.These constructs are designed to allow one to gaze upon them and explore the emotions theircreator associates with them.",0,0,0,0,})

items ({({"coat rack","This item is crafted from a material with a silvery sheen, but which is definitely not silver.  Its design is also highly unusual, as if it was crafted by someone from a culture very different from your own.","couch","These couches are quite comfortable and relaxing.","couches","These couches are quite comfortable and relaxing.","mirror","This is a beautiful full-length mirror with an intricately crafted silver rose at its apex.  You sense that its linkage leads to Corwin's private chambers, entered by moving east.","sword","Hung on the wall is a midsized broadsword that practically radiates power.  A small plaque under it read, \"Grayswandir\".  You sense that grasping its hilt will send you to the shop.","rug","A priceless Persian rug occupies the middle of the room.  You sense that one who stands in the center of its pattern will be transported to the church.","north wall","You sense that walking into the north wall will transport you to another part of Corwin's domain.","candelabra","A moderately ornate candelabra hangs from the ceiling.  You sense that staring at its flames intently will transport you to Corwin's garden; move west to do this.",}),({"bed","This bed is easily large enough for four people to sleep comfortably upon.  It is unmade at present; likely Corwin had business to attend to immediately this morning.","dresser","A solid oak dresser engraved with scenes of a unicorn and serpent in combat.","closet","Perhaps better-named a chifferobe, this is a large cabinet standing near the south wall.  It is made out of a slick black material that is neither warm nor cold to the touch.","nightstand","Corwin's nightstand consists of a meter-square sheet of dark glass suspended in the air a bit over a meter off the ground.  You cannot determine how it is being supported.",}),0,0,0,({"liz","This construct appears as a young, blonde-haired, pale-skinned woman.  Her hair grows to her shoulders, and is held close to her head by a black cloth band.    She is wearing jeans, a Superchunk t-shirt, and a black denim jacket.  Prominentamong her physical features are her beautiful, well-developed breasts (obviouslya favorite feature of Corwin's).  The emotions you sense in connection with thisimage include deep gratitude, strong friendship, half-suppressed sexual desire, trust, loyalty, and long-buried pain.  The depth of the love associated with    this image is both magnificent and tragic, for you realize that, despite        Corwin's best efforts, he retains feelings for this woman that can never be     consummated in their fullest","wendy","This is an image of a dark-haired woman, taller than the other construct but of approximately the same age.  Her hair is braided onto the top of her head in an aesthetically appealing pattern.  She wears a loose blouse and slacks, and has awell-formed, athletic figure.  The emotions that flood your mind when you look  at her include the omnipresent bond of friendship, moderate sexual urges        enhanced by the psychology of \"forbidden fruit\" (a sense of innocence and purityflows from the construct, though you sense that this is misleading in some      ways), admiration of this innocence and purity, the bond of similar souls, and  above all, the need for relief of loneliness.  There also exists the element of the tragic in this love, for though it is returned in its own way, it does not  and likely will not reach the level of mutuality Corwin would desire.  Such is  the nature of existence.","chair","This magical construct consists of blue lines of force that suspend one in      midair, adjusting to provide maximal comfort.  It is very conducive to the      introspection that this room is intended for",}),0,0,0,0,})
