rooms_desc ({"This is a very friendly, warm, and cozy room. There are hard wood floors,\nwith area rugs under the coach and the dinning room area (with four wooden \nchairs, a china cabinet with antiques, and old wooden table that has an \nantique Russian cut glass Vase with freshly cut seasonal flowers.) You notice\nthe main attraction a fire place with a nicely burning fire, that seems both\nrelaxing and soothing.  Nearby there is a rocker that has a blacket on it, and\nbig fluffy pillows on the floor, along with a blanket or two...so if you wi\nto curl up and fall asleep. You also notice in the distance the sounds of the\nocean pounding against the rugged coastline. You also see the moon dancing \nacross the ocean through both the bay window that is open just enough for a nice\nnight breeze as the curtains dance along. There is a screen sun porch with\na hammock. There are many smells that tickle your nose: night, salt, \nthe sweetness of flowers, and something with apple and cinnamon baking in\nthe oven...perhaps an apple pie??? You are able to hear many sounds as \nwell: the buring of crackling wood in the fire place, the bouys, the\nswirling of wind, and the simmering of the teakettle on the stovetop.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
