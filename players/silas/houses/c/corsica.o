There is a small rocking \nchair that corsica likes to sit and read his flyfishing magazines.  Outside\nthe window you notice a river where he flyfishes and kayaks.  You can hear the\nthe fire crackle, and you see a picture on the wall.  This is a perfect place \nfor corsica.\n","It is a marvelous little bedroom, with a big puffy , elegant bed.  It is set \nwith a red comforter, and white curtains.  Through the windows you can see a \nmajestic veiw of the mountains.  The snow capped peaks are really beatiful this\ntime of year.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
