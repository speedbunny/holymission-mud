rooms_desc ({"The frnt yard is full of flowers, roses especially. Many of them are from the seeds of Svengali's bouquets of flowers. On the right, there are several cats playing in the yard. To the north, you see the entrance to her mansion.\nAlso in the yard is a  small bird bath full of rare and exotic birds. If you look closely, maybe you can tell what kind they are.\n---<--@\n","The room is absolutly beautful - you stop for a moment to take everything in. The floor is a glowing white marble. The walls look like a garden, but you notice it is only wallpaper. Directly in front of you there is a marvelous firplace.\nAbove the fireplace, you see the wedding portrait of Svengali and Wesleyanne.\nIn the distance, you can hear music playing...it is... Tori Amos, _Under the Pink - and More Pink_. This house is very relaxing.\nOn a table, you can see yet more flowers. This time they are Tulips, from Svengali's front yard.\nTo the west, you see the entrance to the living room. To the east there is a dining room.\n","As you enter Wesleyanne's living room, you suddenly realize that the music, Tori, is coming from this room. In the corner you see the stereo with many CD's sitting around it. \nThere is a beautiful floral couch in the center of the room. Next to the\ncouch is a coffe table with several books on it.To the west, you see a large window which has a mysterious glow. To the north you see the entrance to a long hallway. The east leads to the main entrance.\n","This is a long hallway that leads from the living room to Wesleyanne's bedroom. There is a soft green rug which runs the entire length of the hall.\nThe ceiling looks as if it is 20 feet high, but you know that it is just an optical illusion. However, there are small parakeets flying at the top.\nThe walls are painted a soft mauve color. They have cabinets below them on the floor. Open them up and see what is inside.\nTo the south, you can visit the living room, or for the curious, you can visit the bedroom, to the north.\n","You have found yourself in a room which Wesleyanne only allows certain people to enter, apparently, you are special.\nThe room is very romantic and seductive. In front of you is her bed. The comforter is a different print, one you do not recognize, with teal green, a deep blue, a soft mauve and cream.  There is something sitting on the green pillow.\nOn a nightstand next to the bed, she has several things sitting on it. \nThe walls are a soft cream color. She has several plants all over the room. This is a very light and airy room.\nTo your left, there is a dresser with four drawers. There are also many items on the dresser.On your right there is a desk with a Macintosh Quadra 605. Finally, in the backof her room, you can see her closet.\nThe only way out is to the south.\n","The dining room is set up for a dinner. There are several place settings. There are candleabra's with lit candles on the table.\nThere is not much in her dining room, however, you think there is a secret box on the wall.\nYou can go north to a hallway or west to the main hall.\n","You have entered an other hallway of Wesleyanne's house.\nThis one leads fromthe dining room to another room, which you can not figure out. \nThe floor is a green plush carpet. The walls are a soft mauve color. There is something in the corner. \n","As you look around, you notice that this is a nursery! Svengali and Wesleyanne have a little baby! All around the room there are signs of a baby.\nTo the left, there is a crib, which the baby is in. She has a bottle with her. You begin to wonder is that tebby bear belongs to the baby!There is a table next to the crib with a few items on it. Also, there is a rocking chair in the  right corner. There is a blanket in the chair and a card.\nThe room is decorated ina very cute way. There are teddy bears on the wall paper and a monkey too!\nTo the north, there is a nother room with a glowing light coming from it.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
