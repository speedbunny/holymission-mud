rooms_desc ({"The room is covered by black stucco \"walls\" everywhere you look, and is dimly\nlit by a single bubble lamp on the far side of the room.  On the left side\nof this room, you see a black circular bed which is being inhabited by a\nblack and white leopard named Snuggles.  You try to pet Snuggles, but then\nrealize that you know better.  You really have grown attached to your left\nhand.  On the right side you see a gleaming mirror finish Tuba standing\nupon a pedestal.  Next to the Tuba, you see a gleaming Hematite Mellophone,\nobviously the world's most perfect instrument.  You suddenly feel at piece as\nyou stare at the giant \"Etch A Sketch\" on the right wall.\n     After doodling on the toy for an hour, you return to the land of reality,\nand sit on the enormous black leather bean bag chair.  As you rifle through\nWhiplashes frige, you notice that the only things in there are Sun-Drop\nand cans of squirty cheese.  Upon careful inspection, you see that all the\nSun-Drop has the initials \"SH\" on them.  You inspect Whiplash's CD collection\nand see that he owns really dorky CD's.  Titles like Yoko Ono, Nana Masourki,\nJames Taylor, Ramones, Steel Pulse, and Billy Joel can hardly be considered\nmainstream.  As you get comfortable, Snuggles gently plops on your lap.\n","\t\tSnuggles follows you into the rec room...\nThis is the lavish rec room of Whiplash.  In the middle of the room is a red\npool table with several balls scattered atop.  The triangle has been lost,\nand Whiplash does not feel like replacing it.  Near the back of the room\nis a Table Tennis Table, and next to that is a very large trophy case with \nseveral paddles, balls, and other assorted trophies.  If you try to play him,\nyou will be utterly demolished, so don't do it.  Next to the table is a bar.\nOn tap at the bar are over 46 brands of Beer, Ale, Stout and other assorted\nalcoholic beverages.  However, there are no glasses in sight.  hmmm.....\n\tYou find yourself playing Mortal Kombat 3 for several hours, and\nfinally decide to relax on the movie theatre seats watching Clue over, and over,\nand over again.\n\n\tYou awake about 4 hours later and stumble to your feet, dizzy.......\n","\t\"Lay out all your troubles upon thy throne, and ye shall be merry\",\nreads the sign above this door.  Cute.  anywho, as you might have guessed,\nthis is the bathroom.  very pleasent.  very quaint.  very yellow.  Yes my\nfriends, this bathroom is yellow.  Deal with it.  Everything is yellow in\nthis room, right down to the anti-bacterial handsoap in the canary yellow\ndispenser.  You are wisked away into a magical land of Banana's, canaries,\nlemons, sunshine, and Professors wardrobes.  If you get sick of the color, well,\nyou're in the right place!  Aim carefully!\n*\n\n\tOh, umm......Snuggles followed you in here too, but you shooo him away.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","\n\nThis room is entirely Blue and White, with a touch of Gold, just as it should\nbe.  Over in the closet are numerous letter jerseys and other assorted\nregalia all pertaining to Kappa Kappa Psi.  Over on the left wall, you \nnotice the words \"Strive for the Highest\" intricately painted upon it.\nYou see the Big Book of Secret Stuff! over near the south wall.  Feel\nFree to look!\n",0,0,0,0,0,})
