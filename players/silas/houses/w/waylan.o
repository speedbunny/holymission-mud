On either side of the grandfather clock there\nare some rather decorative ferns which give the room a more lively\nfeeling. Through the door to the north, you can see the den and to\nthe east the dining room.  You can hear some noise that is probably\na TV set coming from the doorway to the west.\n","You are in Waylan's den.  To your left is a beautiful bar made of highly\npolished oak.  There are many different bottles on a glass shelf behind\nthe bar and many champagne glasses hanging upsidedown above it.  In the\ncorner to your right is a baby grand piano with a bench in front of it.\nWaylan must spend many an hour in this room relaxing and relieving stress.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
