However, please feel free to rest and relax.\n"," This is the Living Room of Master Windbane. Windy has spent many tired\nnights in this room unable to make it to bed. As you look around you see \nmany splendors. The room is hazed in a soft silver glow. Against the wall lies\nthe most comfy couch you've ever seen. It is opposite a large Sony Entertainment \nSystem. There is also a large smooth and polished crystal coffee table in the\ncenter with old unread mail hastily thrown upon it. In the far corner stands\nan old mahogany bar. It is as you could guess stocked to the max with any drink\nyou could ever imagine. Adorning the walls are pictures of Windy's alterego\nChris and his friends. There are also trophies, honors and awards. Above the \nlast thing you notice, a huge fireplace, is a large mirror in the shape of\na DeMolay emblem. This room is not extravagant, it is as it will always be,\nhome. And the occasional crash place of Windy's friends. So make yourself\ncomfy and enjoy.\n","This is the Kitchen of Windy. As you look around you notice that Chris has all the luxuries of a modern home at his convenience. the walls are a bright pearly white and the woodwork is that of that of a shiny black. There is a huge refridgerator on the side that is adjacent to the counters. feel free to make yourself a snack. There are doors to all sides. To the north is the Dining Room. To the south is the Den. To the east is a Bathroom and to the west is the Living room.\n","As you enter the bathroom you immediately notice how sweet smelling it is in here. Far better than smelling otherwise you can be sure. The bathroom has all the basics. There is a relieving looking toilet set next to a large marble sink. On the floor are Dark blue mats that are soft to the touch. On the far side however you notice what must be the largest walkin shower you have ever seen. As you look inside you notice that the shower is like a room to itself. Besides a shower room you can see both a tempting jakuzi and an inviting sauna. there is also an indoor swimming pool at the back!! You feel this could be where Windy spends most of his off days. You glance out the far end windows by the pool to see a vivid view. This side of the house looks upon Chantilly's Garden and the view from here almost takes your breath away. Being in this part of the house makes you want to rip your clothes off and rest your body. You might as well cause everyone else does.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
