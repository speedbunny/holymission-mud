Along the north wall are a fridge, a stove and more \ncupboards.\nOn the bench is a coffepot full of rich steaming coffee which makes your nose\nitch with anticipation. Also on the bench is a knife rack holding many sharp\nand wicked looking knives.\nBeside the knife rack is a bowl of fruit.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","After much walking you have reached a village. The land all around remains\nmuch as it has been so far, flat and featureless. Overhead the rains continue\nto fall. The grasses also continue here and it is obvious that the village is \ndeserted. All the huts are in disrepair and many are falling down. You wonder \nwhat has happened to the occupants of this village? Surely that gruesome stone\ncould not have taken them all? You feel fear as you wander through the village\nfor there is not a single scrap of clothing or implement to identify who might\nhave lived here. It is as if they never were. They have passed and none shall\nknow.\n",0,0,0,})
