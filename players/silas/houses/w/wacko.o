You realize how easilly you could get lost in here\nwithout a map! There is a door to the east, leading to the guest\nroom, and a great hall, opening up to the north.\nYou also notice that there are two archways to the south, one to\nthe church, one to the shop in town. There is a board with notes\non it between the two archways.\n","You are standing in the main hall of Wacko's mansion. On the walls\nyou notice paintings of some of the most famous mages in the Holy Mission.\nAmong them, Wuntvor and Lord Sith. They look frighteningly real! You see\nseveral rooms off to the sides of the hall. To the north is Wacko's \nmaster bedroom, to the west you see a wood door, to the east you see a\nstrange fire-like force field, and to the south, the main foyer.\n","Welcome to Wacko's guest room! Here you can relax, hang out, converse,\ntrade weapons and armour, and share valuable quest information with\nthe host. There is a fully-stocked bar here, as well as a loaded\nentertainment center. You also notice several pieces of funiture\nneatly placed aroud the room. Off to the corner, your attention is\ndrawn to a dartboard. There is a picture on it that bears a striking\nresembelance to Danseuse! You feel safe here, knowing that no monsters\nwould dare attack the Great Wacko in his own home!\n","This is the western end of a huge master bedroom. You see a\nking-sized bed up against the northern wall.\nThe room is well lit due to the large bay window to the west. The\nroom continues off to the east, and you feel warm air drifting\nin from the east.\n","This is where Wacko stores his items between game reboots. There\nare several shelves in here, on which lye dozens of objects are\nfar too complex for you to understand, but a few of them catch your\neye. They have been placed on a table in the center of the room.\nAlso, there is a staircase going downward to the east. But it is \nblocked by a strange, magical force.\n","This is where Wacko researches new, powerful spells. There are \ncharts all over the walls, many magical items lying around, \npotions and flasks on the worktable, and a small crystal ball\non the desk, which seems to be glowing with an intense, purple\nlight. There is a shelving unit on the far wall, which is stocked\nwith jars that contain such things as \"Eye of Chaosdemon\", and\n\"Blood of Affliction\". You see an archway to the north, and one to\nthe south. The archway to the south contains a closed door.\n","This is Wacko's library. There are shelves in this room which are\nstocked with hundreds of books with such names as \"Theories of\nIllusionary Spell Casting\", \"Ethics Regarding Animation of the Dead\",\nand \"Lessons in Alteration Spells and Their Application in Combat\".\nThere are also several overflowing scoll-racks against the far wall.\nObviously, you think, Wacko is a well-read, well studied mage.\n","This is the easten part of the master bedroom. It is a well-lit area,\ndue to the large number of windows in here. You also realize the \nsource of the warm air. There is a huge fireplace built into the\neastern wall of the room, and it contains a roaring fire.\nThere is a large walk-in closet to the north, but is is locked-up\nright now. Also, you notice a love-seat in the center of the\nroom, where Wacko and Misticalla can sit down after a hard day\nof questing and relax by the fire. You also notice a small tree in\neach corner\n","This is where Wacko practices the spells that he studies, as well\nas summoning creatures to battle. Sometimes he keeps creatures in\nhere to assist his adventuring and questing. As you look up, you\ncome to realize that the ceiling is just one gigantic skylight!\nYou might want to get out of here soon. There is a knee-deep fog in\nhere which is glowing bright red and yellow. It's probably some unstable\nform of magic, perhaps a by-product of an experimental spell!\n","Of all the rooms in Wacko's House/Fortress, this is without a doubt,\nThe strangest. Everything in this room is made out of black marble.\nYou notice the smooth, polished marble is perfectly clean, and not a\nscuff mark is to be noticed anywhere! Along the walls you notice at\nleast twelve Archways, one on every wall. Some of the archways have\ndoors. Others have swirling mist, or glowing red and blue light in them,\nand appear to be magical in nature. Still others lead to tunnels which\nwill bring you to various places in and aroud town. The only thing \nthat they have in common is the fact that above each archway, a \nsingle word is etched in the marble, telling where it leads.\n",})
