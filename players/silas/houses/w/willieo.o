You feel weird just being here.  Hopefully the rest\nof the house won't be like this room.  There is a table in the corner with food\non it.  I don't think you want the food though, just look at it!  The ceiling \nhas a hole in it and you can almost see into the room upstairs.  The walls here\nare strange.  They seem to be rippling and moving yet when you look directly at\nthem you can't see them moving at all.  Strange.  Please, enjoy the other rooms\nin the house.  Willieo would want you to.\n","This is Willieo's garage.  That's why the door was so dirty!  You look for\nWillieo's Porsche but then remember that he said it was in the shop.  There are\ntools laying on a workbench against the far wall.  He has a bike hanging from \nthe rafters which looks like it might work (it is all rusty).  The garage door \nopener seems to be out of order because you can open the garage door.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This room is Willieo's very own.  Noone can come in here but him (and maybe\nwizards, I'm not sure, probably though).  He likes that privacy\n\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
