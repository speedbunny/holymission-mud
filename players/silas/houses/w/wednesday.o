rooms_desc ({"The house is a loft with the emmense ceilings covered in track lighting. As you look around you notice the floor to ceiling windows protected by blue velvet drapes, and sheer white curtains under.\nThere doesnt seem to be any rooms but just a spacious living room that sinks into the floor by three steps to a wonderful living room area.  The couches are soft and a gray velvet with throw pillows and blankets all over.  A large TV sits here with the stereo, but you cant seem to find the speakers.\nFrom the sunken living room you see a beautiful redwood table, very victorian in design, with eight chairs and a large ironcast candle chandilier hanging in the middle.\nOff to the other side of the room you see a black Steinway grand piano, resting by the window, the track lighting somehow falls very innocently upon it.\nPast the piano you see a bed that sits only two feet off the ground, made very neatly with a wonderful gray spread, with a down blanket folded neatly at the base.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
