It may not be much, but Westley calls it home.\nOn the walls you can see pictures of his beloved Glyn, along with a golden\nplaque that catches your attention.  in the middle of the room is a small\ncarousel, but don't try to ride it, it hasn't worked in years.  You can\nsee a booth alongside the western wall, covered with pictures and other\nmementos that are scattered about.  In the northern corner you can see a small\nstatue of Westley, made for him by the sculptor of the Corellians.  If \nyou're lucky you might even get to see Westley throwing darts at the board\nnailed on the south wall.  To the north you can see Westley's cove.\n","You have entered Westley's cove.  The fireplace crackles quietly against \nthe sounds of Mozart echoing through the room.  In the corner you can see\nhis metal cot, along with his nightstand covered with pictures of his \nbeloved Glyn.  He hasn't had much opportunity to decorate the room much,\nbut he's tried as best he can.  On the walls are trophies and mementos he's\nearned from his travels.  You shiver at how hauntingly quiet this room seems\nto be.  To the south you see his foyer.\n","There's really nothing here to see, save for the lounge chair in the corner\nalong with a window with the view of the ocean, even if it is one of his\nillusions.  You might even catch Westley here once in a while just letting\nhis mind go wherever it wants to.\n","This room seems rather simplistic compared to the other rooms, but it's only a\nhallway so there isn't much else that could fit in here.  There is a small\ntable against the wall with a vase on it, but other than that this room is\nbare to the bone.\n","It's a bathroom, get over it.  There's nothing here to see.\n","This is Westley's little greenhouse, just a little addition to his house that\nhe felt he had to superfluously spend money on, just to have it here.  You\ncan see all the little plants he's grown in here in the very short time he's\nhad the greenhouse.  There are some very unusual scents in here, but you\ncan't quite put your finger on it.\n","This is where Westley barbecues his steaks just in case he's in the mood.\nYou look up and notice that there's no roof to this room except for a metal\nscreen.  In the middle of the room is a huge stone fireplace where Westley\ndoes all of his cooking, or most of it.\n","Ever been to Atlantic City?  Maybe even Las Vegas?  This room makes them all\nlook tiny.  Even though it's confined to a simple little room, it has all\nthe makings of a big casino.  You can see the gambling tables all around the\nroom, unfortunately the gamblers have all left for greener pastures.  Guess\nWestley shouldn't have fixed all the games.  There are blackjack tables,\npoker tables, roulette tables, even a window for virtual horse racing.  Of\ncourse, this room shouldn't even be here, but no one ever accused Westley of\nbeing the traditional one.\n","This is Westley's storage room, where he puts anything ranging from food to\nweapons to even teddy bears for target practice.  It even has an exit to the\nshop just so he can get there a lot easier than running all the way back to\nhis foyer to get the hell out of his house.  Other than that there's nothing\nto look at, except for a few weapons lying on the floor.\n","This is Westley's favorite room out of his entire house.\nHe's put a lot more effort into this room than into the other rooms he's created\nfor himself.  Running around the room are his greatest and favorite creations\nthrough his years, the Warner Brothers and their sister Dot.  You can see\nYakko Warner running around the room after a nurse in a skimpy white outfit,\nwhile his brother Wakko waits by the door for something, anything to eat.\nMeanwhile, their sister Dot just wants a little peace and quiet.  Westley just\nwishes he were a wiz to actually code Yakko, Wakko and Dot and not just have\nthem as mere illusions.  Then again, there are always those copyright\ninfringement things that always manage to tangle things up.  C'est la vie.\n",})
