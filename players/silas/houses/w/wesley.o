You see a sideboard and upon it are\nletters, most of which are overdue bills waiting to be paid. Wesley is a \nstudent....\nYou also see a crystal chandelier hanging down from the ceiling and the\nlight glares into your eyes, making you squint. A single framed picture of\nShizuka Kudo hangs on the wall above the sideboard. You notice that it is\nfrom her latest album cover.\nThere is an exit leading to a room north.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
