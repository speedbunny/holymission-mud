There is\na large area in the middle of the room where you can stand \nand address them. \n","You have entered a great arena where people do combat to the death.\nThe crowd cheers as you step into the arena. You get the feeling\nthat you will soon be engaged in mortal combat\n","This seems to be a place where people drop things why they go\nout to look at the wounders of Rome. You can put your things\nhere and come back for them when you are ready to leave.\n","You are standing on a dock where the Roman Ships come in and\nout. There is a great deal of activity going on. It seems to\nlook like Roman troops are going over seas. You cant help but\nwounder where they are going.\n","You are standing in the inner chamber of the Roman Senate. this\nis the area where the senate rests between meetings. there are\nmany places to sit and rest. You feel very comfortable here.\n","You are standing in Senator Akira's inner chamber. This is where\nhe rests after passing judgment. This room seems to be very nice\nbut you can tell that Akira passes judgment because he likes it\nand he's not just in it for the power.\n","This is the area where the warriors who will be fighting in the\narena wait before they go out to die. The smell of fear fills\nthe room\n","This is where Akira the Vagabond Guildwarrior waits for his\nnext opponet to enter the arena. The room is well kept and\nyou feel safe just being in it.\n","You have entered the city's prison.  After passing judgement on the peons who\ninhabit the Holy Roman Empire, Akira sends the guilty parties to this chamber.  On the walls you can see the decayed and bloodied remains of the guilty \nparties who have been sentanced by Akira and were once chained to the walls.  \nYou almost slip in the puddles of blood which seem to cover the floor at every\nturn.  Something (maybe the fearsome and gigantic guards who watch your\nevery move) makes you want to leave this place immediately.\n",})
