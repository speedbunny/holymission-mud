Despite its obvious grandeur,\nyou feel extremely welcome and comfortable here!\n","The first thing you notice here is the grand piano.  Next to the\npiano is an antique bookshelf filled with music.  At the far side\nof the room, against the wall is a huge stereo system and a variety\nof cd's in the rack on top of the stereo.  A huge bay window faces\nthe beautiful backyard and on the window sill are countless green\nplants.  There is a huge fluffy couch against the other wall.  This\nrooms seems perfect for listening to music and relaxing!\n","You have just stepped outside through a set of sliding glass doors.\nIt is now easy to see the beautiful mountain the house is situated\nupon.  The clear blue sky and white snow capped peak add even more\nto the majestic air this mountain portrays.  There are a few scarce\nski trails near the top and a lake sparkling from the sun at the\nbase.  Resting against the side of the house are a set of skis and\npoles.  What good would a mountain like this be without them!\n","You have just walked over a small footbridge.  Running under it \nis a beautiful babbling brook slowly running down the lower part\nof the mountain.  There are trees all around with a nice grassy\nopen meadow in the middle.  This looks like a very secluded place,\nperfect to get away to when you need peace and quiet.    \n","This seems to be an informal living room.  There is a huge fluffy\ncouch and some chairs surrounding an exquisite oak coffee table.\nOpposite the couch, against the wall is a huge television with a\nVcr.  There are many leafy plants by the windows and in a few of\nthe corners in the room.  On the walls are a variety of pictures\nand photos.  This room seems to be attatched to the game room\nfurther to the south, perfect just to relax in or entertain!\n","This is obvious a room to have fun in!  There is a large stocked\nbar at the far end, with a huge neon Bud Dry sign behind it and\na tap to the side.  There is a Seaberg 200 jukebox against one\nwall, a pinball machine and a few slot machines at the opposite\nside of the room, and a bumper pool table in the middle.  A\nlarge number of Anheiser-Busch signs surround the room, including\nmirrors, neon clocks, and a light up Spud Mackenzie dog.  You                 \nstand in Awe! :)\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is Alia's study.  Towards the back of the room is a huge oak\ndesk, with bookshelves lining the walls behind.  There seems to\nbe as many books in this room as would be in any impressive library.\nResting on the desk, are numerous pictures.  The chair behind the\ndesk is made of soft comfortable leather.  This seems to be a\nvery quiet and pleasant place to work in.  \n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
