You feel safe here,\nyou are likely to take a little nap on the sofa in front of you. You\nsee a huge, strong table, a woodden chair, and you notice the soft and\nnice carpet under your feet. Allsiante is standing in front of you\nsmiling and inviting you to take a seat near him. He may have got a\nspare bottle of beer for you :)\n","You hardly can see anything inside the bathroom... The room is filled\nwith hot steam. There's a large bath tube to your right side and a shower\nto the left. There's a toilet to the right of the shower cabin and you\nsee a big blue towel hanging on the wall near the cabin. A small window\nopens on the wall in front of you.\nIf Allsiante's in the tube, you'd better leave quickly :) Unless you\nwanna join him... (very few _women_ could up to now :)) Don't forget\nto close the door behind you - after you leave, of course :)\n","You arrived in the hall of Allsiante's home. There's nothing in here\nexcept the coathanger with Allsiante's robes. You can leave your\nstuffs here, they'll be safe, while having fun with Allsiante.\nTo the west there is Allsiante's living-resting-time spending room.\nGo ahead, meet him !\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
