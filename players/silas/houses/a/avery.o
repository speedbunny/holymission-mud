As you\nlook toward the house in the north you hear the sounds of the \nocean and can feel the breeze as it hits your face.  You have\na sense of being very welcomed here.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","As you walk through the front doors of Avery and Bobers house\nyou find yourself in a grand foyer.  To the left is a large \nstaircase which seems to extend to the heavens.  The slate          \nfloor glows from the light of the many skylights above and you\ncan hear the chime of the grandfather clock.  East you can see\nthe sunroom and to the north there are steps leading up to the\ngreat room.\n","A you walk up two steps you find yourself standing in a large\nairy room with tall cathedral ceilings.  The north wall is made\nup of large windows that allow the view of the beach and ocean\nto become one with the room.  The beautiful colors of the sea\ncan be seen throughout the room as you look the furniture and        \ncarpet.  Double french doors lead out to the deck towards the\neast and to the west is the master bedroom.\n","Glancing around, it is obvious that you have entered the bedroom.  \nThere is a hugh comfortable looking bed against one wall.  On the\nbed are many fluffy pillows of all shapes, sizes and colors.  Against\nanother wall is a beautiful tall oak dresser with a large oval mirrow\nattatched to it.  Many different colognes, powders and such line the \ntop of the dresser.  In the corner, there is a chaise lounge with a\ntable next to it.  Most of the table is covered though with gorgeous\npictures in solid oak frames.  With the windows against the far wall, a\nclear view of the ocean is seen with the waves laping over the rocks.\nThe last thing you notice is Averys little \"pooh\" bear siting in the                                                               \nmiddle of the bed.  You think to yourself, aww...how cute:) \n","Bright sunlight strikes you as you walk into this room of windows.\nYou can feel the warmth of the sun as you sit in one of the many \npieces of furniture placed around the room.  If you look to the \nsouth the mountains can be seen and to the north is the ocean.\nThis room is full of exotic plants and trees which gives you the\nfeeling of the outdoors.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
