The room itself is lit by torches placed in sconces scattered around the walls\nThe room comtains several low couches and divans for visitors to rest upon, and in the centre has a long table of polished oak upon which lies weapons of all types.\nAll in all, this is a MAN'S room. You can tell this by the many tinnies scattered throughout the room and the decaying pile of laundry that lurks in a corner, gnawing on a sock\n","This is the centre of Arclight's house, and is warded off from the rest of the world with many powerful spells.
