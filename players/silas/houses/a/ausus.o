This large beach-house is built on shore of the Mediterranean\nsea, but the nature is so unspoilt that you wonder whether it really \nIS the Mediterranean.\nYou come out of your dream and look around. A piano is standing in the \ncorner, and a very big cosy sofa is standing in the middle of the room\nfrom which you can see the sun set.\n","In this bar you can get every drink you've ever wanted. All the tropical\nstuff (of course served with fresh fruit), but also common things like\ntea and coffee can be bought here.\n","This bathroom has a the conveniences of the 90's. You see a huge \nwhirlpool, with lights and all that unnecessary stuff, and of course\na huge mirror. (Ausus is kinda vain...)\n","You enter the bedroom, and the first thing you notice is the huge canopied\nbed which is standing right in front of you. All around you are candles\nburning; they seem to have been burning here forever.\nAt one wall of the room is a make-up table, and you can see lots of\nperfumes, make-up and other girlish stuff standing on it. There are also\nsome dresses lying over a chair; all very airy and light.\nOne other wall is completely decorated with lots and lots of photo's\nof Ausus' friends.\n","As you walk onto a large terrace, you can feel a soft sea-breeze running\nthrough your hair, and smell the salty sea-water. The terrace is decorated\nwith lots of colored lights, and it looks as if it has been used for many\nparties. If you would keep walking on, you might as well take a dive\ninto the azure-blue ocean.\n","Are you crazy?!, is what you think when you enter this room. All around\nyou are fitness-apparatus, and you wonder 'Why', since the rest of her\ndomain is such a heavenly paradise. Well, every person on the beach wants\nto look slim, and the only way to accomplish that is to work out sometimes.\n","As you walk further on the terrace, it becomes a large tropical garden.\nSince the climate is so warm here, exotic flowers are able to grow very\nwell, and exotic creatures like being here too. Through the whole garden,\nthere's running an artificial stream, and ends in a small waterfall.\n*\n","This kitchen is very new, although you know that Ausus uses it lots of times\nto (for example) bake one of her famous applepies. She can also cook\ncomplete meals; maybe she'll make one for you\n","You decide to take a dive, and splash into the water. The water is very \nclear, and you cn see lots of fish swimming in it. As you look over the\nsea towards the land you can see on what a fantastic spot Ausus has\nactually built her home. There are palmtrees everywhere, and the climate\n(as well of the land as the sea) is absolutely perfect.\n","If you have an allergy, don't go in here. You look around and see about 4\ncats sitting on soft cushions, and other cat-stuff. They look rather fat\nand disgustingly spoilt, but I can assure you that they're the sweetest\ncats oyu've ever seen.\n",})
