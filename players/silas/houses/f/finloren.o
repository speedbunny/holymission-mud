rooms_desc ({"You have arrived in what looks like a walled, open, pavilion-like,\nstone platform.  This is the Great Hall.  As you look around, you\nrealize that the Hall rests within the branches of a massive tree\nnestled in the midst of a forested island.  Trees border on all\nsides, the boughs of which form a floral canopy above.  Additional\nstructures border on all sides -- cradled within the branches of \nneighboring trees and connected by stone walkways.  The structure\nto the north is open like this one, all the others (eight in all),\nare small, enclosed buildings.  You can see snow-capped mountains\nfar to the east and west and you hear the distant rumble of two\nmassive waterfalls that cascade from the mountains -- feeding \nthe small lake that surrounds this arboreal island.  Angry rivers\ncourse north and south from the lake.  The Hall is 50ft long\nby 40ft wide with a large fire-pit in the center -- encircled\nby four, crescent-shaped tables with four chairs each.  Large\ntorches sit atop the short wall and flank the four exits.  Large,\nlife-like statues of wolves, howling with heads arced, sit in the\nfour corners.  There is also a small, bronze sign to the right of\nthe north exit that attracts your attention.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
