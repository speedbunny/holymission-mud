rooms_desc ({"You have entered the main hanger and docking bay of the mighty DEATH\nSTAR.  The sheer size of the room makes you feel insignificant.  All\naround you Stormtroopers bustle to accomplish the various tasks assigned\nto them by their superiors.  Also visible are the tenacious engineers who\nstruggle to maintain the high standards and performance capacity of the\nseemingly infinite numbers of TIE fighters which nearly cover the floor\nof the hanger bay.  The entire area is kept neat, ordered and impossibly\nclean according to the rigorous standards of both the Dark Lord of the Sith, \nPhil Vader, and even the impossible standards of the Emperor himself,\nAkira.  This seems to be a place full of tremendous power and you can\nsense an enormous force which almost overpowers your senses.  \n","     You have entered Lord Vader's conference chamber.  This is a\nhuge spotless room with a single, long, carbon black table in the\ncenter.  Twenty comfortable looking chairs surround the table, one \nfor each of the Galactic Empire's Admirals.  At the end of the table\nsit two imposing, high-backed seats which resemble thrones.  One of\nthese seats is reserved for the Dark Lord Phil Vader, and the other \nfor the Emperor, Akira.  You are overwhelmed by the beautiful, yet \nsimple decor of the chamber and await the arrival of your masters.  You\npray that they find you acceptable...it would be tragic if they \ndid not.  Two Stormtroopers align each of the exits, and you find \nyourself enthralled by the mere sight of the two crimson-clad Royal\nGuards who stand as sentries at the northern exit...the entrance to\nthe enigmatic Lord Vader's personal chamber.  You can feel the \nenormous rush of energy of the Dark Side of the Force which flows\nfrom that direction.\n","     This is the room where the great Phil Vader goes to meditate after\ncommanding the Imperial troops throughout the galaxy.  This is another\nsimple, yet beautifully decorated room inside of the mighty DEATH STAR.\nThe room is almost entirely empty except for the HUGE chamber which\noccupies the center of the room.  Inside of this chamber is where Lord\nVader goes to escape the pressures of being second in charge of the \ngalaxy.  Only Phil Vader himself has access to this area of the \nDEATH STAH.  Here, as before, you are mezmorized by the impressiveness\nof the crimson Royal Guards who stand watch at every entrance.  You\ncannot begin to fathom the sheer dark power of the Force which rushes\nfrom the east exit.  The fear you feel is much to great to allow you to \npass through this entry.\n","You are crushed like a cockroach by the power of the Dark Side.\n\t\tYou were warned.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,})
