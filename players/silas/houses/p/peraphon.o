On the west wall, there is a huge high-tech entertainment system,\nwhich makes you jealous when you look at it. Also on the west wall is a \ncomputer terminal of some sort. On the east wall is a kitchenette, with\na large fridge, microwave, and gas stove. The whole of the north wall is \ntaken up by a HUGE steel door, that has hinges the size of a tractor. There\nis a sign hanging over the door.\n","You come into a room that is one of the most huge manmade structures you\nhave ever seen in your life. In front of you there is a huge aisle, which\nis nearly as wide as Gorgurack. On either side of the aisle there are many\nrows of pews, and there are people sitting in these pews, praying and giving\nthanks to their God. You walk along the aisle to its end, and see a huge altar.\nThis altar is made purely of white marble, inlaid with gold and platinum.\nJust by looking, you can see that this is the most beautiful place you have \never visited. Looking up, you can see that the huge ceilings contain \nartwork that would put Leonardo da Vinci to shame. You fel tempted to look up \ninto the huge stained glass windows... there you see the image of a woman, \nclad in long, flowing robes and wearing a headband. You are sure you have seen\nthis woman before, but you can't exactly remember where. Just by looking upon\nher serene beauty, you can tell that she is a God among gods, someone who \ndeserves to be worshipped. At her feet, you can see a pile of shiny discs, \nwhich almost look like coinage of some sort. \nAtop the highest ledge, there is a choir, singing Canto Tupporiano.\nThere is a HUGE sign hovering above the altar.\n","You have entered a small cube-shaped room, that is lit on the inside with \ntorches. The room is very dark, even with the torch. In front of you, there \nis a door. A monk, probably a Tuppiscan monk, comes out and greets you. He sits\ndown in the lotus position in front of you, and invites you to do the same. \nOnce you are seated, he says \"Tell me all your sins, My Child. The Great \nGoddess will hear them... and the kinkier the better\". The monk then gives you\nhis hands. You feel a tingling sensation, and really want to stay here, in the \npresence of the Great Goddess.\n","You have entered a small dungeon cell. Strewn about the floor are the bones of \ncreatures long dead. Also on the floor is the corpse of... something... \nobviously, the dungeon cleaners haven't been in this week. Fairly ignorant of \nthem... Chained up on the wall is what used to look like a man. It still seems \nto breathe shallowly, but it is obviously laboured. There is a sign hanging up \nabove the poor tortured soul.\n","Upon entering this room, you see it is full of gold, jewels, weapons\nand armour of all sorts.\n",0,0,0,0,0,})
