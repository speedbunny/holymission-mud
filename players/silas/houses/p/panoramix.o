You are only here causs\nTreant Panoramix showed you the way to this magical place!\nTo the north u hear a soft slumber of what looks like some\nkind of human voices. Follow Panoramix, and find out!\n","Here you see treants every where! On your way to here Panoramix\nexplained what, and what not you could do here. Don't\nbother the older treants, and never make a big fire around here!\nAll treants are relaxed causs u have a mark of Panoramix\non you. You can walk around savely!\n","Here you here some older and wiser treants talking with eachother.\nBetter not bother them, they dont like to be interupted!\nMaybe if u listen very carefully u can here something wise said.\n","Here in the middle between strong and brave treants you see a\nstatue of a lady. She must really mean alot to Panoramix.\nAn old elven gardner is keeping it clean.\n\n","You entered a place wich you didnt know was for treants\nwho are in love with eachother. Slowly you notice treants\nflirting with eachother.\nBetter slip away here, and leave them in their sphere of love....\n","As you enter this part of the little wood, you feel good\nmagic radiating trough your body! You must shiver in \ndelight and total pleasure! Panoramix tells you that this\nis the place where he can change between being a strong\nand wise Treant, and a young, caring and tender\nloving Half-Elf. Maybe one day he will show you!\n","Suddeny as u pass between the treants you see a more open \nplace. Between huge caring female treants young\nhomeless childeren play between the treants and shelters.\nArent they cute to see? Better let them play in peace.\n","Here floats another part of the small stream of water. \nMore little childeren play in the water, making eachother wet.\nAll smiling, even when they sometimes have to listen to the\nfemale treants, who learn then how to cooperate with nature\nin a good way. It will benifit them for the rest of their lives!\n","A little spring is here, and you see clear fresh water bubble\nout of it.. making a stream to the east. The sounds of it\nmust make u wanne fall down and asleep!\nSo do it, its totally safe here..\n","A little stream floats east and west here. Maybe you\nshould drink the water, and taste its purity and \nrefreshness! Lay down and listen too the happy sound of\nplaying childeren east of here, and the beautifull sounds\nthe birds make here!\n",})
