There's plush carpet on the floor, and you have a general feeling of welcomeness....\nYou see a long fishtank along the wall facing you..There's lots of colourfull fish swimming about in it...It's quite soothing to just sit here and watch...\n","Pause's kitchen...\n   This seems to be one of the largest rooms in the place...You can tell that he likes to take his food seriously...\n   There are cupboards all round the room, and along one wall is a huge fridge/freexer, a large oven, and a deep fat frier sits in one corner...A large dining table takes up one end of the room, it sits in front of a large window, which looks out on the village far below..Looking out of the window, you think you can see small, almost recognisable figures, wandering about...\n","   This is Pause's main area..All around this room are huge sofas, comfy chairs, and just about the hugest number of cushions you've ever seen..!!!\n   The marble floor is cool to the touch, daring you to walk barefoot, and the large, soft rug sprawled in front of the open fire is very inviting...\n   The only source of lighting in here are the candles placed round the room, giving a soothed, relaxing atmosphere....There is soft music playing..\n","   Near the south wall in the kitchen was a bin...You've just entered it...\n","  As you enter this room, the lights flicker on, a gentle light filling the room. The first thing you notice is the large four-poster bed, which has been sunken into the floor, so that it's level with the ground...The posts reach up towards the ceiling, flimsy curtains hanging from the beam across the top...\n","   The equipment room...I'm the only one to see it anyway, so why am I bothering..???\n",0,0,0,0,})
