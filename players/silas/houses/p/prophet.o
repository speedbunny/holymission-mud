Thisfoyer has exquisite Italian marble flooring and the walls are lined withstatues of well meaning prophets of yester-year.  The walls themselvesare painted in a soft apricot colour, and one large singlechandilier hangs from the high ceiling above.To the west is the lounge and east is the cloak room.","You have entered a darling little cloak room.  Odds and ends of everykind can generally be found in here.  Feel free to browse and takewhat you want, you know that Prophet will not mind.The foyer enterance lies to the west.","This living room appears warm and friendly.  It has a very rusticappearance, and the fact that it is a sunken lounge adds justthat extra character to the room.  In the far corner is a largefireplace, and above its mantel are many of Prophet's huntingtrophies.  The glass coffee table in the centre of the room issurrounded by lounge chairs, bean bags and cushions.  Your hostrequests you make yourself comfortable.To the east is the foyer and north is a passage leading to themore private quarters of Prophet's domain.","The walls of this passage are cedar lined, and the ceiling is low.Large flaming torches line the walls, and throw exciting shadowsdown the length of the hallway.","You have enter the large, spacious and cosy master bedroom of the house.The cream walls have unusual swirls of light and dark blue blended throughout.  A large shag pile rug lies slightly off to the left ofyou, and is a light blue in colour.  A slightly rounded king sizebed is located up against the far wall near the walk in robes.It has a thick and very warm looking navy quilt covering the bed.The windows to the north look out on the beautiful ornimental garden,and are dorned with periwinkle blue taffeta puff curtains.Glass doors lead to the terrace your western side, and the robes are to the east.","You find yourself in a pleasant sandy cove, with high granite cliffssheltering you.  The sun is shining brightly and a light gentlybreeze blows softly on your body.  The sand is clean and white and the wavesare rolling in onto the beach and foaming everywhere!Towards the middle of the beach you notice a large beach rug already laid out on the sand, with a white and navy blue shade cloth positioned over top.On the rug in ice boxes you can see fresh salads and fruits as well aswines being kept chilled.East leads back to reality! ","This is a large walk in robe. Racks of clothing are everywhere.There is enough hanging space for all of Stryker's clothing. Twowhole racks alone can be seen to be filled with just nightwear, andthree more with evening gowns that would make most women envious of even the least of them.  Beyond this it is hard to tell what elsethis closet contains. It is so large you have trouble comprehending its size!","This is a quaint little bedroom side terrace. Small shrubs block out anyunwanted sights, but yet at the same time they add colour and a senseof peace to this area. Small flower beds lie all around, and a small tabble andchair set for two is well postioned in a pleasantsunny spot in the northern corner of the terrace.You feel that you could easily spend all day out here, lazing away thetime in the presence of a close friend.","You have entered a small ivy covered alcove. The bright sunlight is partiallyscreened by the leaves giving this whole area a pleasant coolnessand makes it a great place to escape from the hot sun on such a day as this.A knarled bench chair that can easily seat two is located to your left.You notice that it has been carved out of a single oaken trunk.The ground is strewn with a light covering of leaves and small twigs.Tiny animals and small birds can be both seen and heard from this hidingplace. You feel that upon entering this small area that time has slowedright down, enough even to allow you the pleasure of just sitting andrelaxing. You feel very much at peace in here and know that you are perfectly safe. A tree to your right has a short messsage carved upon it.To exit this alcove just walk north.","You have entered a misty, silent room without a ceiling, leaving youexposed to the heavens. The miriad of stars glimmer in their glory highabove you. The room itself is sparcly decorated, having only a sunkenbed against the back wall, and ventalation shafts to clear the mist andsteam that permeates this place.",})
