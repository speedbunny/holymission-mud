You see torches lit on the walls, a very very high ceiling,and a thick deep red rug covering the floor.","This is the main room of the palace.  It's absoultely gigantic.  There are fireplaces in the northwest and northeast corners with fires burning brilliantly.  The red rugis still below your feet.  There are couches around the room and veils hanging fromthe ceiling.  You feel this room could hold a hundred people.  There are gigantic icesculptures of dragons and knights, which, for some reason are unneffected by the roaringfires burning away.","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, youstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,a cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..A small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.","You are standing in a dark room with black leather arm chairs, and walnut wallsreaching hight to the ceiling.  A small fire burns in the fireplace quietly in the corner.On the walls are trophy's of Phire's more impressive kills along with various armourand weapon pieces","BRRRRRR!!!!    You are in the freezer where Phire keeps his rations",0,0,0,0,0,})
