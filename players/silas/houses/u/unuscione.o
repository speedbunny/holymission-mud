You figure you might as well make the best of things \nand look around his house.\n","Your footsteps echo across the green marble floor that you are walking\non as you step into Unuscione's room. Looking at the walls and ceiling,\nyou see that he has painted them black, with green dots varying in size\n....ah, now you see that this is the universe as he wishes it to be, \nspace with green stars instead of yellow and white. His waterbed sits at\nthe back of the room with a expensive looking green and black comforter\nover it. To your right is an in-floor hot tub that he relaxes in frequently.\nYou see an empty bottle of Dom lying next to the hot tub and you wonder\nhow long it has been there and where Unuscione is now... Past the hot tub\nis a refrigerator stocked with various alcohols and foods, the best thatt\nmoney can buy. Over on your left is his stereo that he uses to listen to\nhis favorite music when he feels nostalgic for times gone by. You guess \nthat he must be very comfortable here and that is why he doesn't spend\nalot of time outside of this house...\n","This room looks like a cheaply made cartoon, and you really aren't\nsurprised to see Beavis and Butt-head sitting on a couch watching\nTV, since this IS the house of Unuscione, damn weirdo that he is...\nThey look at you for a moment and seem to be about to say something,\nbut then, a video with some loosely dressed women comes onto the TV\nand they stare at the TV drooling. After a few minutes, Beavis starts\nplaying with his lighter. How strange...\n","As you step out onto the bridge, you realize that the entire room here\nis made out of mirrors, the floor, the ceiling, even the bridge that\nyou are standing on! You foolishly look over the edge of the bridge,\nand immediately feel your stomache churn once you realize that you \ncannot tell how far it is to the floor, or how far up to the ceiling...\nUpon looking again, you see that the bridge is here to keep you from\nfalling into the crystal clear water that comes up to the underside of\nthe bridge. What a strange place......\n","This large room is simply adorned, surprising considering the rest of\nUnuscione's house, its only item is a picture of the founder of\nIsshinryu Karate, Tatsuo Shimabuku. Even though it is not decorated in a\nmanner as expensive as the rest of the house, this room fills you with a\ninner peace and powerful determination.\n","All of a sudden, a brisk chill sweeps your body as you enter Unuscione's\nwinter room. Snow floats slowly through the air 24 hours a day here, \nand although there is at least 3 feet of snow on the floor and you were\nchilled just a minute ago, you now feel comfortable amongst the cool snow.\nAs you take a final look around the room, Unuscione suddenly jumps up in\nfront of you and plasters you with a snowball!\n","Your eyes try to adjust to the darkness as you enter Unuscione's private\nscreening room. This is where he watches newly released movies with his\nfriends. At the northern wall is a movie screen, and Bose speakers line\nboth the East and West walls. Also near the front are three rows of\nplush seats. To your left, there is a popcorn machine, where you can get \na bag of fresh, buttery popcorn, free of charge. There is also a soda\nfountain, next to the popcorn machine. Enjoy the movie!\n","Upon entering this room, you immediately recognize it to be an asian\nbath house, having a pool in the middle that is 4 feet deep and filled\nwith hot water. An immense amount of steam rises from the pool, making\nit difficult to see your way around in here, but it is relaxing all the\nsame. Several large towels sit on a bench near the east wall, in case a\nguest uses these facilities.\n","What the hell?! You could have sworn that you were in Unuscione's house\na moment ago, but now you are strapped into the Mantis, the world's\nfastest, tallest, steepest stand-up rollercoaster at Cedar Point, where\nUnuscione worked this summer. Not only are you on this nightmare of\nspeed, you are in the front car as well!! The coaster starts up and\nsends you screaming through the air as the Mantis takes you up, down,\nsideways, and upside down several times at speeds up to 65 mph. Being\nthat you are in the farthest right seat, you also feel like you are\ngoing to hit every single metal pole that holds this monstrosity up in\nthe air. After a few moments, the ride is over and you stagger to the \nexit, with your stomach churning the whole way.\n","As you take your first step into the room, you realize that you are\nstanding on a giant slide. You quickly lose your balance, and start\nto slide the slide at a rather rapid pace. At the bottom, you slam\ninto a gigantic pit filled with small, plastic balls! You look around\nyou and see nets on all sides going all the way up to the ceiling.\nYou start to feel younger and more energetic...\n",})
