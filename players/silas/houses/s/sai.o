The way the moon glitters off\nof it, you are reminded of a scene of someone and his or her lost love,\nholding hands, sitting near the lake, looking up at the moon, and spending\ntime together.  Such a scene can easily be reenacted here -- the lake is,\nby far, the most beautiful thing you've seen.\nThe entrance to Sai's house is through a door to your north.  To your east\nlies a toolshed, with a glowing field surrounding the door.  Upon closer\ninspection, you see sparks and such jumping off of the shed, as if a glyph\nof warding has been placed on that shed.\n","Sai's foyer is your average, run-of-the-mill foyer.  Its common features\ninclude an ornate chandelier hanging in the middle of the ceiling, and\nseveral portraits.  A portrait of Sai himself hangs on the northern wall,\nwhile on the eastern wall, smaller portraits of Sai's mother, father, and\nolder brother hang proudly in their places of honor.\n","You are inside Sai's toolshed.  Sai usually keeps stuff here that he cannot\ncarry, and when he stashes things here, he usually expects them to still be\nhere when he comes back for them.\nChances are, if you see this room, it means one of two things:\n     1) You're Sai.\n     2) You're an immortal.\n","This room, strangely, is also well-lit -- You guess Sai must like light.\nThere are scrolls hanging from the walls of this room, with words written\nin nihonese.  The scrolls are numbered 1 through 6, and each contains some\nlittle word of advice that Sai's parents have passed to him.\nA plush red carpet covers the floor, and in the corner of the den, there\nstands a small statue.\n","All around you are trophies, made of solid gold.  Most of them are for\nkarate, though others are for miscellaneous things (dart throwing, bo\ntwirling, underwater basketweaving).  Over in one corner of the room is one\nof Sai's old ninja robes, battered and bruised, but still holding.  Somewhat\nlike Sai himself, apparently.\n",0,0,0,0,0,})
