There is a pile of vomit decaying in the corner.  Beheaded corpses decorated Christmas trees line the walls.  In the corner the petrified remains of umpa lumpas stare back at you in their final moment of horror.  Red carpet covers the floor to hide the blood stains .  \n","This is a guest room for friends.\n","This room has been constructed for her dear friend, Thorm.\nHe is a special friend, and I wanted to give him this room \nsince he begged me to make one for him!  :)\n","\tThis is Sphinx's relaxation room where she spends a lot of time.\nAs you enter this room you are breathtaken by the fragrance of flowers.\nYou notice that the sliding glass doors have been left open and you see\nthat there is an entire meadow full of tulips.  You decide to sit down\nand enjoy this while you can.  Your thoughts begin to clear and your \nmind to open.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",0,0,0,})
