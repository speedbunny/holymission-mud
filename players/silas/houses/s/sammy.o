There's a\nsmell of gasoline coming from the crack in the west door and a sign is hanging\non the south one.\n","You are in the main hallway of the Sammy's residence. Everything around here\nis really big and makes the impression of a palace. But then again, the\npaintings on the wall look modern, which quickly makes to change your mind.\nHowever, the floor in here is made out of pure ivory. Some mix!\nThe great hallway is leading north to the foreroom, south to the living room,\nwest to the dining room and east to the bathroom.\n","This is the living room. It looks very modern and gives a very homey feeling.\nIn the middle of the room stands a little coffee table and beside it stands\na couch made from black leather. There are also two big soft chairs just waiting\nfor you to sit in them. Towards the wall you notice a high pedestal with a\nbig-screen TV and a VCR (both made by Sony, you presume) standing on top of it.\nSome bizzare paintings are hanging on the walls.\nThe doors are leading south to the bedroom, north to the hallway, west to the\nparty room and east to the game room.\n","You are inside a nice and cosy bedroom. There is a king-sized bed standing at\nthe southern wall. It looks like the place where you could have lots of fun...\nBeside the bed stands a little table with a table light on it. A mirror and a\nwardrobe can be seen in the corner of the room. You also notice a big colored\nwindow in the eastern wall through which the sun is shining in the mornings\ngiving this room a kind of magic feeling...\nA door is leading north to the living room.\n","WHOA!!! You're standing in the middle of the party room and you can't believe\nyour eyes! All around you are big speakers, making this room totally Dolby\nSurround! They are plugged into a classy Hi-Fi which is the biggest thing in\nthis room (except for the sub-woofers, that is). You think this room could\neasily produce 1000 watts of music if needed. There are some shelfs with lots\nof CDs, most of them with dance music. Your eyes glare with fire as you notice\na little bar with all sorts of drinks at the southern wall. Looking around\nthe room a feeling of joy overcomes you and makes you feel like dancing!\nThe doors are leading north to the dining room, east to the living room and\nalso there is a window with some writing on it in the western wall.\n","Standing inside the game room you're completely dazzled by the number of\nvarious computer monitors. Looking around you see a lot of different computers:\nPCs, Amigas, Ataris and some game consoles. Most of them have a game running\non, however there is one PC which seems to be in the text mode.\nThe floor is full of cables providing electricity and connecting computers\ntogether. The shelf on northern wall carries lots of game floppies.\nA big door is leading west to the living room and a small one south to what\nseems to be a cabinet of some sort.\n","The dining room looks very elegant. In the middle stands a big extendable\ntable, which can treat up to 10 guests at the same time. Around the table\nare several comfortable chairs and in the centre of it stands a bouquet\nwith a pleasant smell coming from it...\nThe two doors are leading south to the party room and east to the hallway.\n","Tole je edina slovenska soba tukaj naokoli. Pravzaprav je kabinet, v katerega\nima vstop edinole Sammy. Na steni visi deska na katero si Sammy zapisuje\nstvari ki jih ne sme pozabiti. Poleg tega lahko tukaj pusca stvari do \nkaterih drugi ne morejo, hehe...\n","Standing in the garage, you see :\n                             _____\n                           /| ---_~~~~~~-_\n              _____  ___ /  ||     \\      \\__   /~~~~~~~~/\n         __-~~     ~~---___/ |--___| ~~~~~~~~~~~/    /~~~\n      /~~                 ~~~~--   /      /~~~~       \\     \n     [======== /~~~\\ ===================/  /~~~\\ ======]       Grafix by  \n      \\______ | (_) | ___________________ | (~) | ____/== ((((   Oskar    \n               \\___/_/                     \\___/_/             \n \n                            _______,_______,_______\n                          /       //       \\\\       \\\n                    ____/_--____/ |_______(~)\\\\        \\)\n                   /~~~~     ~~--__  /      / ___~~~~~~~~~~~~-----____\n  Idea by         [ =============  ~~  ~~~  |     ~~~---__/ ooo____ooo \\\n   Sammy   )))) == \\      /~\\    ===|=======|=== /~~~\\    \\____::::____/\n                    ---- | ) || -----\\_______\\  | (~) | __/__________/\n                          \\_//    \\ _//          \\___//      \\__//\n \na red Porsche 911 and blue Fiat Coupe. The fiat is used for going to work \n(church-shop-home route only) and the porshe is for hanging out on village \ntrack showing it off to make other adventurers envy.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",})
