There is a black plush velvet\nsofa in the center of the room, with two matching, overstuffed La-Z-Boys\narranged next to it.  The main thing you notice about this room is the HUGE\nblack marble fireplace that stands opposite the couch and chairs.  It's big\nenought for you to walk into (Soozie uses it to roast orcs in!)!!  You feel\nthat if there were ever a fire in there, it would be HOT.  You see two lamps\nstanding in opposite corners of the room, giving it a soft, warm, homey glow.\nCovering the floor is the thickest black shag carpet you've ever seen.  As\nyou walk across it, you get the feeling that your feet are inches off the \nground.  The paintings depict Native American Spirits and Beliefs.  You think\nthat if you ever laid down to sleep here, you would never wake up...\n","This is Soozie's kitchen.  She keeps it locked because Calvyn tends to come\nover and help himself to her food.  There is black-and-white hound's tooth\ntiling on the floor that is polished to a shine.  Off to the left is a black\nsteel door that leads to her walk-in refrigerator and freezer.  To your \nright is a counter with cupboards above and beneath it, which extends to the\nwall opposite you.  The counter contains a double stainless steel sink just\nbelow a window.  And a few framed pictures are hung on the walls.  On the\nfloor, next to the walk-in, are two of the biggest \"doggie\" bowls you have\never seen!!  One is empty, though it looks as if it has just been eaten out of,\nand the other is filled with water that would go up to your knees if you \nstood in it.  You are not sure if you would like to meet the owner of these bowls....\n","This is Soozie's personal bar.  Low lighting here gives a subdued, mellow\natmosphere.  Padded leather bar stools stand along the bar, which extends\nalong the wntire south and east walls.  Shelves also run the same length\nbehind the bar.  The shelves are packed with bottles of liquor found \nboth here in HM and in RL.  Above the bar are racks stuffed with mugs and\nglasses for drinking.  Above the shelving on the east wall is a 17'\nTV screen that will show any program ever broadcast.  There are speakers\nin every corner of the room.  A pool table and pinball machines are srranged\nin the centre of the room.  The north wall holds five old Wurlitzer Jukeboxes\nthat will play any song you wish to hear.  The rest of the space on that wall\nis taken up by many beer taps (the refrigerator kind).  There are mostly \nBudweiser taps, but you can yfind your favorite \"brewski\" here as well.  \nSeveral of the bottles on the shelves have notes attached to them... You look\naround and silently wish this was a room in your house....\n","As you enter this room...you wonder if it is really a room!!  There is a \na carpet of the thickest grass covering the floor, and trees line the east and\nwest walls.  This room is like a tree-lined walkway, though you can see\nthe sky above.  Birds are singing and every once in awhile, you think\nyou get a glimpse of some of the mythical creatures that you've heard Soozie\nprotects and cares for.  It is springtime all year here, and the flowers\nare always in bloom.  A stream runs along your left, and bushes are to \nyour right.  Feel free to look around and enjoy nature!\n","This is Calvyn and Soozie's bedroom.  Obviously this is the largest room\nin the house.  There is a Wizard-sized (that's even bigger than King-sized)\nfour poster canopy bed decorated in black and dark red satin linens.  In the\ncorner of the room there is a large wardrobe.  There are matching dressers \nand night tables carved from mahogany and bone.  There are framed pictures on\nthe night tables.  There is a mirror on one of the dressers and a crystal\npyramid on the other.  You notice in another corner stands a black jacuzzi.\nThe ambiance of this room is one of quietude and tranquility.  A thick, dark\nred carpet, much like the one in the living room, covers the floor in this\nroom.  You see portraits of Calvyn and Soozie's families on the walls.\nThis room reminds you of how much Calvyn and Soozie love each other\nand how strong their love is.\n",0,0,0,0,0,})
