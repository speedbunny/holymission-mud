The entrance is to the north.\n","You are standing in the hall of the House of Smorlok.\n There are stairs leading up and to the north is a large but strange room.\n","You are in my private chamber .... leave quickly or die.\n","The cold walls of the dungeon are splattered heavily with blood here, which\nseems to be rather fresh.  On the southern wall a skeleton hangs from a hook\nimbedded through the back of it's skull.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","You stand on a narrow trail that descends to the north, vanishing into\nswirling mist. Strange sounds seem to eminate from that direction. To the\nsouth the trail just worms it's way between the trees. The air is thick with\nthe smell of pine and spruce.\n","Your are in a deep ravine running north and south. The walls are steep and\nsmooth and you could not scale them even if you wanted to. The ravine path\nis worn into the rock and littered with pebbles and other lose debris that has\nfallen over the years.\n","You are in Smorlok's pool room. You can see a large 20 feet deep pool.\nYou can smell the tasty pool water and you might jump in.\n","\nYou see nothing.\n\nSomeone thinks :*) I'M NOT HERE ....... SO STOP LOCATING ME !!!\n\n","-++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-\n|                                                            |\n|   DDDDDD                   III                 EEEEEEEE    |\n|   DDD  DD                  III                 EEEEEEEE    |\n|   DDD   DD                 III                 EEE         |\n|   DDD   DD                 III                 EEE         |\n|   DDD   DD                 III                 EEEEEEEE    |\n|   DDD   DD                 III                 EEEEEEEE    |\n|   DDD   DD                 III                 EEE         |\n|   DDD   DD                 III                 EEE         |\n|   DDD  DD                  III                 EEEEEEEE    |\n|   DDDDDD                   III                 EEEEEEEE    |\n|                                                            |\n-++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-\n",})
