The\nair is here very hot and the gas coming from the volcano nearly\ncauses you to fall into unconsciousness. To the north and ewest\nyou see the blue sea. Far in the distance you can see a 'Big\nVolcano Peak' in the middle of the ocean. Strange, but it looks\nnearly like the mountain where you are. Only this volcano peak\ndoesn't seem active. Maybe in earlier times part of island sunk\nin the ocean.\n","Warm sand is the first thing that you notice about this place. The sand moves\nbetween your toes as you look about. Water laps at the edge of the beach before\nyou. It appears that it's an ocean out there, since you can't see the other side\nand you can smell the salt. The sun is low on the horizon. You turn, and see\nyour shadow stretch long behind you. Syrah's castle and a few small bungalos\nstand behind you, the castle gleaming white. You realize that you must\nbe in Syrah's realm, as the sun never sets here. This is one of the places that\nSyrah had set aside for sunsets...   ...something romantic...\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
