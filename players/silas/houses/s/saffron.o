The dusty plains\nare broken by three features: huge holes in the earth, great iron \nfortresses, and a winding black river, undoubtedly the River Styx. This is\nthe Layer of Pazunia, Palace of 1,001 Closets.\n","\tThe smell of rotting jungle vegetations greets you even before you\nopen the door. You are at the edge of a range of jagged mountains, over-\nlooking a jungle that seems to go on forever. There is a river some miles\naway, and a path leading from the door toward it. Beyond the river is a\nmassive city inhabited by over 100,000 demons of all description, and towering\nseveral miles high in the center of the great city is an incredibly\nornate palace: The Palace of Demogorgon. Shimmering pools of mercury lay\nbefore you in every direction, most likely gates to other layers of the\nAbyss.\n","\tYou have entered the Realm of Feng-Tu, the home of the Chinese gods\nand goddesses Tou Mu, Goddess of the North Star, and Lu Yueh, God of \nEpidemics. The realm of Feng-Tu appears as a mighty citadel, Oriental in\nappearance, that rises up a branch of the Styx called How Nai-ho. Across\nthe river from the mercury pool from which you have exited is the Gate of\nthe Demons, Kuei-Men-Kuan, which is large enough to permit elephantine \nbehemoths to pass through easily. \n","\tYou emerge inside an elaborate fortress with marching squads of demons\ncarrying pull-arms drilling in the halls around the entrance. This is an\ninfinite castle, the court of millions of demon soldiers drilling constantly\nfor war against both Demogorgon and Orcus (and any stray and especially\nannoying Wizzes that manage to find themselves on Saffron's bad side). The\nmoment you enter, a guard patrol of 100 demons, weapons at the ready, \nsurrounds you, blocking your way. If you ask Saffron nicely, perhaps she\nwould command her demon battalions to allow you safe passage.\n","\tTwo skulls stand guard at the bridge. Their eye sockets gleam, and\noccasionally the jaw of one will move. The other then responds, although no\nsound is audible at this distance. The bridge spans a moat deeper than\nany canyon in the Abyss; not water, but fiery lava flares and bubbles in \nthe distant depths, although mostly all you see is the orange glow on\nthe dark stone sides on the moat. On the far side of the bridge is a massive\nblack portcullis, the light of the blood-red sun dancing across its polished\nsurface. On the gate's jagged, wicked spikes are impaled the mutilated bodies\nof those who have displeased the mistress of this fortress. Some of their\nfaces, barely recognizable through the caked blood and hideous wounds belong\nto such notables as Cirith, Plastic, and Helmut.\n","\tAs you approached the portcullis, the enormous gate lifted with an\nalmost terrifying silence, and the strong stench of sulfur and ozone assailed\nyour nostrels, wafting in from the depths of this evil place. The huge\nchamber beyond is illuminated by glowing red balls which float near the\nhigh ceiling. The room is circular, with thick stone columns of pure\nalabaster lining the outer wall. In the center, four stairways lead up to\na vast platform, shaped in a circle concentric to the walls of the room. In\nthe very center of the room, a vast pillar fashioned from the purest copper,\nrises from the floor to the ceiling nearly 200 feet away.\n","\tAs you ascend the serpent-like stairway, you enter a room which\ntowers over every other point in sight - including the mountains visible to\nthe farthest horizon. The walls and ceiling are formed by a shimmering green\ndome - transparent, but somehow appearing solid. The dominant feature of the\nroom is the dais that towers in the middle, topped by an enormous throne. The\nthrone seems to have been made from the skulls of all types of creatures.\nOne corner of the room is devoted to massive banquet tables, loaded with\nplates and dishes of great finery, each which holds some kind of exotic\nfood. Along the edge of the platform, opposite the banquet tables, thrives\na lush garden of bizarre plants. Many of these are blossoms of exquisite\nbeauty, but others are gap-toothed horros that seem to sniff and snap at \nanything around them. Before the throne is a wide, silver pool. The\nliquid in it appears to be water, but it is unnaturally still.\n","\tStepping into the pool of silver water, you suddenly feel yourself\nfalling, and you retch repeatedly since it feels very much like you have\nbeen twisted inside out. Without warning, you land with a bone-jarring\n*thump* to behold the depths of Hell itself. Horrible screams echo through\nthe cavernous chamber as you look out over a long, narrow lake filled with\nboiling lava. Demons with pitchforks jab at pitiful wailing people trying to\nescape the awful, eternal pain. As you look closer, you realize with a\ngasp of horror that...oh my God...do you see yourself in that pool? You some-\nhow get the feeling that to cross the Princess of Hell (Saffron, of course),\nyou may very well spend time here until the end of days.\n",0,0,})
