There is but\nbut one way out so good luck....\n","You have just entered a huge room with a bar lining the entire west wall.\nIn the center of the room you notice a huge disco ball hanging from the\nceiling.  Behind the bar is a burly bartender and to one side you notice a \nninja bounser who you think you recongnize.  He is paying very close attention\nto you.\nGoolag the Half-Elven Destroyer of Minds\n","As you step off the last step of the deck you are magically transported into \na wonderfully beautiful forest.  All around you can hear the sounds of the \nanimals and see the bushes move as they dart away from you.  To the north you \ncan see a glimpse of the ocean and hear the waves crash against the rocks.\nA tree is here...\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","You have just entered the master bedroom of the Grand Wizard Slivante.  In\none corner you see a huge bed and on the floor in the middle of the room\nyou see a pile of clothes.  The room is nothing spectacular and infact can\nbe considered to be fairly modest.\n","As you open the sliding door you step out onto the deck on the back of the \nhouse.  From here you can see the rest of the estates.  Hanging from the roof\nof the house you can see a bird feeder and as you look around you notice a \nlawn chair where Slivante sits to watch the sunset and rise.\n","You have stepped on to a stretch of beach.  The sun is going down, and you \nsuddenly realize how relaxed you feel.  All you want to to is curl up on the \nblanket beside you and go to sleep.\n","As you leave the ar you make your way into the living room.  As you look around\nyou see a television playing in the corner and you can hear a stereo playing \nas it sits on the table.  In front of the television you see a bean bag with \nan individual sitting in it.  You think you recognize him buyt youare not \nsure.\n","You have entered a darker part of the forest.  You realize that this must be \nthe part of the estates that Slivante devotes to the past and everything bad.  \nYou do not feel comfortable here and decide that you should leave.  To the \nnorth you see a hut.\n","\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have entered THE VOID!!\n",})
