This is the lounge/entertainment room\nwhere parties are held. In one corner is the biggest entertainment\ncentre you've seen, complete with a 61-cm colour TV (with surround\nsound), video and mutlidisc CD player. In another corner you see his\npersonal computer setup, which is a P100 with all the extras and add-ons\nyou ever heard of, and along the opposite wall is a fully stocked wet\nbar, with all the alcholic beverages you ever heard of, plus a few \nexotic one thrwon in for good measure.\n","This is Smeghead's bedroom. In the centre of the room is a king-sized\nheated waterbed. Along one wall is the bigget walk-in wardrobe you have\never seen. There is a large stereo setup on the bedside table, but it pales\ninto insignificance compared to the setup in the lounge room.\nThe walls are covered in posters from all the latest movies, and of\nbands like Guns'n'Roses and Metallica.\n","This is the bathroom. As you look around in awe and wonder you can't\nhelp but notice the absoluely HUGE sunken hot tub in the centre of the\nfloor. It looks big enough for about 10-15 people, more if they were\nREALLY good friends..... You also notice the shower stall in one corner, \nused for when Smeghead can't be bothered taking the time to run the\nspa and whirlpool built into the tub.\n","This is Smeghead's kitchen. This is where Smeghead eats if he can't\nbe botherered calling Pizza Hut home delivery. In one corner is the\nbiggest fridge/freezer unit you have ever seen, while in the centre of\nthe room is an elegant table setting for when Smeghead either eats at\nhome or invites friends over for dinner.\nAlong one wall is the cupboards, stuffed with food and cutlery, the likes\nof which you have never seen before.\n","This is the front yard of Smeghead's house. It is absolutely HUGE!!\nYou can see a rugby field, a swimming pool (olympic sized), a tennis court\nand various other sporting facilities scattered all over the lawn.\nThere is also a quiet-looking grove of trees along one fence where\nSmeghead goes when he wants some peace and quiet.\n",0,0,0,0,0,})
