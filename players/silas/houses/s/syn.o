An onyx desk is positioned by the window, with a small\ncomputer monitor on the top.  Various books are in the bookshelves built\ninto the east wall.  There is a door leading to a small closet on the south\nwall, and another door leading to the bathroom.  The venetian blinds are\ndrawn slightly, slicing the sunlight into the room.\n",})
