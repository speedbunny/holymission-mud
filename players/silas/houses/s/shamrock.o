rooms_desc ({"This is the front porch to Shamrock's house.  There are four white\ncolumns and a huge front door that overwhelm you at first glance.\nA comfortable swing hangs on the far end of porch, because Shamrock\nloves to sit on the swing and relax.\n","Welcome to the living room of the house.  It is a rather large room,\nwith a couch on the east wall and a love seat on the other side of the\nroom.  A picture hangs on the wall over the couch.\n","This is a short hallway.  It has a beautiful picture on the wall to\nthe right\n","This is Shamrock's bedroom or playground whichever term you prefer.\nIt is lavisly decorated from the soft white curtains to the dark green\nsilk sheets on the bed.  This is truly a place where women come to be\nswept away!\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","Welcome to the place where extreme fun is a gross understatement.  This is a\nan unbelievably large room!  In this room you see a basketball court in the\nfar northwest corner.  To your imediate left you see a big screen TV\nsurrounded by four big speakers and a killer sound system!  To your i\nimmediate right you see a bar, and the east wall is covered with pinball\nmachines and video games, and two pool tables and an air hockey table are\nalso cluttering the eastern side of the room!  Directly in front of you is\na giant pool of plastic balls (like from a kids playground).  \nCome on in!\n","\tAs you walk down a flight of stairs, you enter Shamrock's wieght room\nIt is a modest place, where he spends time sculpting his body into a shrine\nof chissled stone.  He likes coming here, because it is a good place to let\noff steem!!!!\n\tThere is a lifting bench and a lat machine on the west wall.  An\nIncline/Decline bench on the north wall, and adorning the south wall\nis a squatting rack and a heavy bag.\n","You have exited Shamrock's house out to a small \"roof-like\" place that\noverlook a beautiful skyline of what appears to be New York City!  It is\na marvelous view.  During the day the scorching sun peeks through the \nmaze of scattered skyscrapers.  While at night, the moon illuminates the\nbusy streets below with brilliant gracefulness.  Such peacefulness is hard \nto come by.\n",0,0,})
