This is not at all the quaint country house you saw from\nthe outside. You stand at the entrance to a giant pyramid shaped room\nand all the walls are made of thin glass! You can see all of the outside\nfrom anywhere in the room, and your senses are almost overloaded by\nthe brilliant twilight sky that surrounds you. To the west you can see\nthe last gleams of a ominous blood-red sun and high above you a small\nsliver of the moon peeks out from behind streaks og\nof violet and blue clouds. The floor seems to flow with swaying tree\nshadows. The room is nearly bare except for a thick mossy green carpet and a\nfew simple pieces of furniture: a long couch, a few comfortable wicker \nchairs and a small marble table. Back to the south you can see\nthe oak doors that lead outside, and to the east, north and west are \nportals of different shapes and sizes magically suspended in the glass ...\n There is a cat curled up and snoozing on one of the chairs.\n\n","  Very few people ever see Svengali's bedroom, so you must be \nvery special indeed ... the room is not that big, but the darkness\nthat fills it makes it seem endless. What you can see is a simple\nemperor sized bed in the center of the room, made of thick heavy wood\nand carved with an elaborate design on the headboard. The bed\nis covered with a number of differently colored sheets, all in\ndissaray, and a pile of violet silk pillows lie on one side. You rouch\nthe edge of the bed and can feel waves of sensual pleasure rising from\nit, like captured memories of what has happened there, besides the restless\ndreams of its owner. The bed is lit from above by a few dozen candles,\nin different states of melting. The window also provides some light ...\n  Next to the bed is small bookcase and nightstand, with a few books\nof art and poetry leaning inside. There is one drawer in the nightstand\nhalf-open. There are a few items on top of it as well. As you walk further\ninto the room, letting your toes sink into the thick carpet, you see\na few more things in the corner.\n  You can close your eyes here\n  and dream yourself away ...\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","  You notice a change come over you as soon as you feel the first\ncool grains of sand press between your toes. You stand on a long\nmoonlit beach that seems to go on for miles in every direction\nso far you cant see the end of it. There is an almost full moon\nhanging low in the sky, and you can barely see the calm surf\ncrashing onto the shore glowing an eerie pale white.\n It is very warm here, and you feel an urge to let your clothes\nfall to the ground and let the cooling ocean mist blow against your skin.\nAlthough there are a few boat-lights far on the horizon, there\nis no one here  on the beach with you ... you feel free and at peace\nYou can see a few trails of Svengali's bare feet here, along with\nanother set of smaller, more feminine feet\nwalking back and forth along the shore, and into a set of dunes\nsurrounded by trembling razor grass.\n  So sit down and relax!\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
