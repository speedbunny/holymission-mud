rooms_desc ({"Graceful magnolia and dogwood trees sweep down to the earth and cast their lovely fragrance in the air.  The flagstone-lined path leads to a portcullis guarded by two weathered stone lions.  A tangle of pale pink roses encircle the doorway, and frame a small coat-of-arms.  An orange cat looka at you in a rather strange manner.\n","a large picture of the decadent Marquis graces the west wall...on the east wall is another picture...\n","You enter this room and feel transported to Memphis, Tennessee and have to work hard not to shout HUH HUH HUH!  A fur-covered couch and rough-hewn teak table stand in the center of grass-green carpet.  The windows ofthe east wall are heavily shaded, and the miniature waterfall, complete with spotlights, contribute to the jungle feeling.  Small knowing monkies stare at you from the table.  You feel the need to pourself a drink from the bar on the north wall.  The carved idol makes you nervous, but as you sink your feet into the tiger skin rug, you notice the king of rock and roll smiling at you.\n","The walls are black and depressing, and you feel suffocated...\nHave a nice day, and try not to feel TOO suicidal!\n","Serene blue, purple and grren light shine down upon you from the stained glass windowed ceiling.  You feel at peace within yourself, but the dimm crackle from the amp in the west corner speaks of the caged energy here.  Next to the amp lies a mahogoney table with an elaborate arrangement of crystals.   The east wall contains many book shelves, filled with crumbling ancient tomes of magical legends.  In the northeast corner stands a globe that spins constantly, below it lies the remains of a classical guitar.   A blue-veined marble fireplace dominates the south wall.  On it's mantle lie the many strange boxes the owner has gathered throughout hte years, as well as a collection of silver candlesticks.   Above the fireplace is a tapestry.   Five guitars hang upon the north wall, beneath them is a straight-backed chair, footstool, and music stand.   Sheet music is piled beside it.  Elvis looks at you from the se corner.  Arious chaise-lounge stands in front of the fire.  Schpankay's cat, strangely enough, also named Schpankay looks at you plaintatively from her favorite perch.\n","You enter this room and find you stand at the end of a craggy white cliff.  The wind gently ruffles a solitary golden weeping willow tree.  You feel all your deepest desires can come true here, you will be mystically pulled out of reality.   You look down at the black forgotten ocean a million miles below you and feel its endless lapping against the shore.  A new moon illuminates the farthest corneers of your soul.\n","You enter a sunlit formal garden.  Blooming beds of white roses, sapphire irises, hyacinth, and gilded lillies line its walkways.  Marble statues of the Gods and Goddes line the walkways.  Venus, Mars and Mercury eagerly stretch their arms towards you.  Venus gazes a a solitary flower lying ont a massive granite altar .  Next to the flower lies a glowing ruby athame and a delicate circlet of filgreed silver.  An inscription is carved in Pictish runes upon the altar.\n","A canopied, curtained bed dominates the center of the room.  It's soft purple silk gently cascades from its cherry beams, sweeping the mossy green carpet.  next to the bed is a carved nightstand with a small picture upon it.  The heavy dresser stands under a tapestry on the west wall.  You look up at the ceilling and see a glistening zodiac and starry sky.  A white marble fireplace casts subtle light upon the room.  on the mantle you see a burnt-out candle stub under a picture of the king.  Next to the king stand a statue of Jim Morrison, and beside Jim is a flower-bedecked shrine to John Lennon.  A rather protly black and white cat stares at you from under the bed.\n","Jimmy Page stares at you menacingly from the east wall.  He weilds his Les Paul like a weapon and wears a Nazi officer's cap.  Beneath him rests a glowing bow.  Robert Plant plays Jimmy's foil on the west wall.  He is all blonde curls, tight tight jeans, and seductive gaze.  John Paul Jones hides behind a labyrinth of instrument on the north wall--keyboards, bass, three-neck guitar, and mandolin.  A candle burns beneath a shrine to John Bonham on the south wall.  The room pulsates with laser lights and dark electricity.  A statue rests in one corner.\n","TUNA!   A gigantic tuna...simply a really big tuna...\na fish you know....:P\n",})
