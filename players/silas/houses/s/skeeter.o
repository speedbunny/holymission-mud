It is bright and airy, with a beautiful marble floor and a grand skylight above.\nTo the west is the central focal point, the Atrium, why not go out and relax?\nOr to the north is a living room which leads to the bedroom.  To the south are\nan entertainment room and dining and kitchen facilities.  Need to store goodies until the next adventure? Then west is a closet.\n","This Gallery leads towards Skeeter's magnificent bedroom. It houses the many\nmemories that he has collected from his travels.  Look also at the paintings\nhung carefullly on the wall.  To the east is the bedroom.\n","This beatiful Atrium has been carefully cultivated for a relaxing get away\n","You have entered Skeeter's entertainment room. You can't help but notice all\nthe electronic gizzmos surrounding you.  There is a Pioneer home theatre system here with a 100\" Big screen TV.  The U-shaped couch\nin the middle of the room invites you to kick back, relax and choose from\nthe thousands of titles Skeet keeps on hand.  You notice also a bar off to \nthe side of the room, why not get a drink, or a beer or cider from the tap?\n\nTo the north is the foyer, to the east is the dining area.\n\n\n","This dining room is done in a tasteful darker motif.  It looks to be right\nout of a Ralph Lauren ad!  The centerpiece is a large oak table big enough to\nseat 12.  You get the feeling many magnificent meals have been served here!\nTo the east is the kitchen, to the north is the Atrium, and west is the                    \nentertainment room\n","This bedroom is perhaps the most spacious you have ever seen!  everything is      \nhuge!  The king size bed sits in front of a massive 60\" TV.  If one only had a                        \nbeer they would be in heaven!\n\nto the east is the sitting room, to the west is the gallery, and to the south\nis the atrium\n","This is the sitting room, perfect for dressing activities.  There is a three\nway mirror, to make certain everything is right, and a stool and dresser\nfor all other things.\n\nTo the west is the bedroom, and to the south is the bathroom.\n\n","This is the kitchen, with everything a cook could want, with a gracious amount\nof space.  All the appliances have been done in professional Stainless steel,\nand there are plenty of cooking implements.  In the frige one can always find\na nice beer, or a great bottle of White Bordeax.  Munchies are o'plenty in\nthe cupboards, so help yourself.  \nTo the west is the dining area.\n","This is a massive bathroom!!!  You notice a smaller room housing the camode\nand biddet, and a huge Jacuzzi with a window overlooking the Atrium.  One could live in here, and sometimes Skeeter does!!\n\nTo the north is the sitting room.\n\n","This is a small room for Skeeter and his friends to leave any personal\nbelongings that they might wish to save until they return next ( or until        \nreboot). So feel free to leave anything behind in confidence that it will, in      \nin fact be here when you return.\n",})
