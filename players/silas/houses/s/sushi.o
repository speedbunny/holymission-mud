Or was it?\nYou tracked in snow somehow....\n","It sure is dark and empty in here... Helloo-oo-ooo.... Echo. Echo.. Echo....\nIt is very dark.\n","You step through a portal and suddenly realize you've trapped\nyourself in a glass cage, with the portal as the only obvious exit.\nOutside the glass, you see an expanse of water and coral reefs,\nwith schools of fish watching you with interest, passing flakes of \nfood to you from high above, where the water does not lap over the\nedge of the cage. Unfortunately, the walls are too smooth and too high\nfor you to climb.\nAs you look on, a few angry sharks try to batter the glass, putting a few\ncracks in it... water is seeping in... I'd get out of here while I still\ncould if I were you.\nMeanwhile, the rest of the fish seem to be getting a form of net\ntogether to scoop your corpse out with in the event of your impeding\ndeath... a giant toilet bowl in the corner seems to be your expected\ncoffin....\n","You have entered Sushi's dojo and excercise room. The floor here is padded\n-- get those dirty boots out of here!  You see a paper and wood screen\nopposite you, allowing light into the room, which reveals some blunted\nweapons hanging on the wall, a jacuzzi, and a trampoline.\n","You notice that this is where Sushi does most of her work -- the paint and\nink flecks on her illustration desk are obvious of that. In front of the\ndesk is a swivel chair, and next to it is her portfolio, open to a framed\npicture of an airbrushed chess board.\nOn a table next to the desk is a radio and a cassette rack, and in the \nback corners of the room you see an easel, canvases, and art supplies.\nOn one wall is a mural of a green and gold chinese dragon, painted by\nSushi herself.\n","\tYou've just entered Sushi and Gambit's room, which is split into levels\nby glass staircases and glass platforms with steel rods running through \nthem. The wall opposite you is sheer glass, revealing a majestic view of\nMount Ezo. On the main floor, you hear running water and turn to see a\ncrystalline POOL sparkling in the afternoon light, at the center of a \nJapanese GARDEN (with a WINTER ROSE in it). A small cascade (WATERFALL)\ntrickles down through the ceiling, splashing the ivy creeping up the walls\nbefore it enters a hole in the floor. Somewhere far above the pool, you spot\na DIVING BOARD on another glass platform.\n\tCuriosity gets the better of you; you climb the clear steps to the \nhighest tier, pull aside a lace curtain, and halt in your tracks... Clearly\nthis part of the room is off-limits to anyone other than Gambit and Sushi.\nIn front of you is a large waterbed (BED), with black satin sheets and \ndown pillows on it - next to the bed you actually see the outline of an\nextradimensional DOOR.... Wonder what's in there? Maybe her WARDROBE??\nWho knows....\n","You enter a dimly lit room with soft light aimed at the various drawings,\nairbrushed pictures, ink drawings, and watercolors on the walls. Each \npainting is of the actual person playing characters in real life. Sushi's\ngot a picture of Kevin, Kurt, Brian, Jez, Owen, and Elizabeth here. You\nwonder who their characters are....\n","The walls here are colored a beautiful garnet,  and the room is aptly\nfurnished with a t.v., a black leather couch, a stereo, and a halogen lamp.\nA skylight lights the room brightly.\nYou feel like sitting down and relaxing here...\n","As you enter the room, a candle on a table lights up and from all around you\nyou hear the relaxing tones of \"Sweet Lullabye\" by Deep Forest. Your eyes\nslowly adjust to the dimness of this room and you see several small candles\non shelves. A flash of light above you catches your eye and you look up in\ntime to catch a glimpse of a shooting star arc across the night sky\noutside the glass ceiling.\n\tIn one corner of the room you see a low onyx coffee table with two\nlarge silk cushions as chairs, and a large candle sits to one side of the\ntable. The rest of the room looks just as warm and inviting... satin \npillows are scattered in one corner and a featherbed mattress lies in another \ncorner.\n\tThings to look at here: Ceiling, table, cushions, pillows, bed,\ncandles, and tea.\n","Opening the west panels, you step onto the cool green grass in your bare\nfeet. You are in a mud-simulated version of CAUMSETT PARK, a place some-\nwhere in another world (the real one) located in Lloyd's Neck, Long Island,\nNY.\n\tIt is a warm spring afternoon, and the opposite side of the potholed\npaved trail opens into a wide bowl-shaped field with a *huge* tree at its\ncenter. Without waiting another second, you dash breathlessly down the \nhill to the tree, feeling childhood memories of climbing trees return. When\nyou get to the tree, you push the long branches that touch the ground aside,\nand enter a natural umbrella formed by the tree's outer branches.\nThere is a rope here, leading to a thick branch eight feet above you.\n\nThings to look at here: Rope, branch, view, wildlife, swing.\n",})
