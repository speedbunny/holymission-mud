An archway leads to another chamber through the west wall, back on the\nnorth wall is an entrance to the Wedding Chapel of Illuvatar.  In the east\nwall you notice the entrance to a small side room, the church portal opens to\nthe south. You feel the peace and holiness of this place and you are sure the\ngods would punish the sacrilege of shedding blood here.\n","You are standing in a beautiful chapel. Light streams in through the delicate\nstained glass windows, flooding the chapel in brightness and colour. Above you\nyou can see the chapel organ, with its intricately embossed piping. There are\nlots of seats here, where people sit for services and wedding ceremonies.\n","This is a side room, containing a kind of elevator to move you up and down.\nThere is a shaft leading upward and downward to the west.\n","Everything is silent here. The only sound you hear comes from\nfrom the robe of the father, as he pages through the bible,\npraying. Pray, pilgrim, pray for the mercy of god!\n","You are standing in a small passage of the church. This room\nis completely empty, except for a door to the north.\nYou get the feeling that this room was used as an altar room\nto pray for the dead in former times.\n",0,0,0,0,})
