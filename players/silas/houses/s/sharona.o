After coming in the skillfully crafted French doors (made by Sharona herself), you can see Sharona's warm and fuzzy personality reflected in each and every corner of the house.  After steppin past a tile floored area in front of the door, you see lots and lots of soft, plush carpet.  Please take off your shoes and sink your feet into it (this also helps Sharona keep the carpet looking new).  On the side wall of the entry hall, there is a soft and comfy looking h couch so that you can have a seat if you have been walking for a long time. \n\n","THis is the living room in Sharona's house.  THe first thing that catches your eye is the very large framed picture of Sharona and her husband, Kawai.  You also notice many smaller pictures from the wedding reception (aka the orgy).  Also around the room are pictures of all of sharona's closest friends.  The carpet is lush and the furniture is very plush and inviting.  There is asmall bar in the corner, help yourself to a drink (just be sure to use a coaster.)\n","This is the bathroom in Sharona's house.  Of course, this isn't just any bathroom.  It looks like something that you would find in the penthouse suite of the world's finest hotels.  There are all of the ordinary bathroom fixtures, but they are all very shiny and well kept.  The bathtub is one that you have to walk up the stairs and step down into, and it has controls for jacuzzi if that is what you so desire.  There are mirrors on the walls and the ceiling, so you can see what you are doing at all times.  Climb in for a bubble bath...sink in and enjoy.\n","You have just entered Sharona's game room.  This room is clearly where the party is in Sharona's house.  Speakers from the music room run in here, providing music for the festivities.  You can hear it blasting \"My Sharona,\" the song that is most often heard in this house.  A full wet bar, complete with a bartender, greets you and beckons you with a full selection of mixed drinks.  If you choose not to drink, then there is a full selection of non-alcoholic beverages. A pool table, foosball, darts, pinball, and a karaoke machine await all that are willing to have a good time.  To the north, you see a sliding glass door leading out to the pool and patio.\n","s You have just entered the pool area at Sharona's house.  It looks like something that you would see at only the finest of resorts.  The clear, cool water practically beckons you to jump in and go for a swim in the huge pool.  If you want to dive, please use the deep end.  On the deck, many lounge chairs await those who want to take a nap in the sun.  If you forgot your sunblock, no fear.  There are all different kinds on the counter of the bar, so help  yourself.  Another bartender, looking somewhat like Tom Cruise did in \"Cocktail,\" is standing behind the bar waiting to serve you your favorite tropical drinks (Sharona is partial to Sex On The Beach and Stawberry daquiris herself...)  A masseuse is on call for those of you who like a massage in the sun,\nso feel free to take a load off and get comfy.  A jacuzzi is also on deck, so there is everything in the making for a Club Med vacation.  To the north, you can see Sharona's personal beach stretching for miles\n","You have just set foot on the sands of Sharona's private beach. For miles, all you can see is fresh white sand and the clear blue ocean that crashes upon it.  You feel like you are in a tropical paradise.  Feel free to pull up a lounge chair and sunbathe or play on the beach volleyball court.  Sharona has anything that you might need...just ask her.  Have fun, but don't get too much exposure to the sun...you might get a bad burn.\n","YOu have just entered the bedroom of Sharona.  This is where Sharona lies to rest every night, and has the occasional \"overnight guest.\"  The furnishings are both lavish and tasteful.  A king sized waterbed is the focal point of the room, with a deep blue comforter and many pillows placed upon it.  A beautiul dressing table sits in one corner, with a beautifully etched mirror on top of it.  A walk in closet is filled to the brim with clothes and shoes that sharona takes great pride in.  The carpet is soft, velvety, and deep blue.  The lighting is rather dim (kinda romantic, isnt it?)  You have to be really special to Sharona to be invited to the bedroom, so feel important.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",0,0,})
