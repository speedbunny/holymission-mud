The\nshutters closed and the paint smooth and dark. The whole setting instills\nthe words DARK and POWER into you. You have one choice now. You may leave\nin peace or risk having your life changed in unspeakable ways. The choice\nis yours, the closed door is to the north.\n\n","As you enter you notice first the overwhelming mental pressure fall upon you.\nThis is not a place for those weak of heart and mind. You notice the heads\nof many a wild beasts adorning the walls. There are holes in the north, east,\nand west walls that appear to lead nowhere. You could try them, but you feel\nthis to be unwise. In the northeastern corner you perceive several portraits\ndepicting people you assume to be deceased. In the northwestern corner there\nis a large statue.\n\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
