rooms_desc ({"The enterance to the house of Solomanus.\n","This is the kitchen, with all the boring stuff that used to be in a\nkitchen and that i don't detail.\n","This is the hall room in the house of Solomanus. Here he accepts \nhis guests and usually chats with friends take place here.\n","The dining room of the house! Here Solomanus used to invite only the\nbest friends (maybe because only they forgive the meals they have to eat\nhere).\n","This is a sideroom in the house of Solomanus, used to store things\nso they are not under feet but near to the exit.\n","This is the working room of Solomanus. You can see a large mahagony desk\nwith a lot of books, papers, magic-looking items on it.\nThere are also books on the shelves, that cover each wall. Seems the\nowner travelled through the world and collected knowledge from everywhere.\nFiles with maps, memories on monsters, quests etc. stand in perfect order\nin a fileing cabinet.\n","The room is dominated by a cupboard with a lot of clothes inside and by a\nhuge mirror-table with all of the stuff a lady needs to take care of her \nbeauty.\n","Bedroom in the house of *suppressed*. A huge french bed is located at the\nnorth wall, for obvios purpose. There's a cradle next to the bed. Seems\nthe owner of this house doesn't lack luck :).\n","This is the bathroom of the Solomanus-house with all that equipment i don't want\nto detail\n","Secret room.\n",})
