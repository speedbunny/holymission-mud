The walls are covered in PICTUREs which are all numbered for easy indexin\nYour eyes are drawn upwards to the ceiling where you are amazed to find loads\nof little pieces of rock bolted to the ceiling so that Spangle can practice\nfalling off of routes without getting cold or wet, or maybe he just can't be\nbothered cleaning the floor ever!\nThere are doors leading off in every direction but one in\nparticular catches your attention. TheDOOR to the south is made of\nglass and light floods in and fills your soul with happiness and joy...Cringe!\n","On entering the bedroom you realise there is something missing.....A bed!\nThere is a lot of Scafolding in this room but why?\nUnder the scafolding you can see a DESK and books but it looks a real tip.\nPhotographs of climbing exploits cover the walls, you can look at them if      \nyou are really interested in that sort of thing. There is a certain musty climb\nng smell about this room and hence why the WINDOW is always opennot just for   \ncats to jump out of!\n","You have entered the most sacred room in the house....The Bathroom.\nHere you can while away the hours in a lovely SWIMMING POOL with a rather novel\nWATER SLIDE. Alternatively you could maybe just utilise the big white TELEPHONE\nin the corner to speak to Hughie or Ralph after a heavy day in the Bar.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.

You hear a distant sound of bagpipes ecoing up the glen, broken\nnow and then by the familiar sound of GROUSE warbling in the heather.\nThere is a loch stretching halfway down the glen infront of you, the surface\nis like a sheet of glass, reflecting and distorting every detail of the\nmountains along either bank. The sun is reflecting off the surface straight\nonto your face making your skin feel healthy and warm...you feel \nas if you want to stay here for ever to recover from your wounds.\nIn the corner of your eye, you notice a wee furry animal scurrying about in\nthe heather, WOW! you have actually seen a live HAGGIS. \nBecause it has two feet shorter than the other two, you start chasing it the wr\nng way round the hill and it falls over, rolls down the hill and drowns in the \noch!\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
