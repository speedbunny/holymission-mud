rooms_desc ({"You're in a large, airy room with floor and walls of black veined marble.\nThe lofty ceiling is also pure black. The floor is decorated with large,\nmystical symbols and runes of the long-forgotten summoner language.\nThere are two small glass-topped tables, each with five comfortable-looking\nchairs arranged around it. On each table stands a crystal decanter, a bowl of\nfruits and five crystal glasses.\nAt the far end of the room a large double-door can be seen.\n","You enter a long corridor. The walls are made of the same black veined marble.\nHanging on the walls are various pictures of strange, exotic and quite ordinal\ncreatures. Hanging from the ceiling is a crystal chandelier which fills the \nwhole room with bright magical light. At the far end of the corridor are two\ndoors, one on each side. You can notice a small sign on the left one.\n","This chamber seems to be a combination of office and bedroom. A huge bed,\nlushly canopied and quilted, nearly fills the southern end. A large wooden\ncloset sits next to it. Across the floor are spread rugs made from the skins\nof many of the large carnivores found throughout the world: brown bears,\njaguars, panthers, wolves and a tiger.\nThe other end of the room is taken up by a large desk, plain wooden chair and\nsmall table. Few tapestries, picturing monsters and scenes of element-wrought\ndestructions, add a dark touch to the walls. Several torches flicker in scones.\n","This is a huge room. The walls are lined with bookshelves. In the center is\na large stone table. Bottles and beakers of various chemicals are found both on\nthe stone table and in other parts of the laboratory. At the far corners,\nalmost obscured by shadows, stand two golems, an iron and a silver.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,})
