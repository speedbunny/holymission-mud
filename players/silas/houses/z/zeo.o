An obsidian desk is nearly lost in the shadows in one corner, \nAnd a strange glassy statue stands in another.  Two plaques, one marble and\none some soft, shimmering grey substance, are affixed to the walls.  A large\nwindow dominates the south wall.\n","A silvery blue dome, spangled with jagged streaks of some reddish silver alloy,\narches above you.  The streaks remind you of some strange, fiery lightning...\nas if the storm above fitted somebody's mood so perfectly that they left an\nelectric aura to permeate the room...  Your skin tingles.\nThe room underneath the dome is divided in two.  On one half, the walls and\nfloor are completely composed of some glittering sky blue metalloid -- \nbright and smoother than silk.  The other half of the room is nearly hidden in\nshadows.  The dark grey-blue metal, smooth and cool to the touch, seems to \nabsorb the light from the glowing roof almost entirely.  Each side is \ndominated by a long, crescent-shaped table, a black table on the sky blue\nside, and a gleaming white table on the dark blue side.  Both tables are\npiled with documents and manuals.  And in the center of each table sits a \nlarge grey terminal.  The terminals both sport active matrix color screens,\ncompact inkjet printers, shimmering grey-blue shells, and transparent\nkeyboards.  And each is running Linux...  Next to each terminal is a small\nnameplate and postit pad.  The center of the room is dominated by a raised\ndais.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
