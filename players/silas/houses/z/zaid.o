rooms_desc ({"As you enter throught the grand archway...you look around and see a huge\nopen room.  Beautifully laid marble floor with a nice long winding stairway\ntowards the far side of the room.  There is a nice sunlight overhead that\nallows the bright sun to stream in over all the beautiful plants on the \nright side of the room.  You get the idea from this foyer that this is going\nto be a grand house!\n","As you enter the room the first thing that strikes you is the huge\nportrait of Liz Reagan hanging over the fireplace, as you walk furthur in\nyou realise that you have entered The Liz Reagan Appreciation Club House.\nQueen slowly croons \" love of my life \" in the background as golden hazy\nsunlight filters through the skylight.You feel awed at the sense of coolness\nthat overcomes you.\n","This room is all padded and you come here when you are major pissed off with your pals and wanna throw them around and not give a damn if they get their miserly little brains bashed in, the ideal room for a day out with the family,or your girlfriend and all her ex's , or girls from the States generally.\nBe careful not to punch anyone down in the groin cause it hurts.\n","As you walk in through the door you see a cold empty beach directly in front of\nyou.  The sky above is grey and overcast.  Huge waves roll in with the cold\nnorth wind and furthur along you see the beach in shrouded in a wet misty rain,\nbright red coke cans litter the west side of the beach near the crusted hull of\na beached schooner.  The wind slowly picks up and a driving rain moves in, you\nwonder what a Sparc 10 is doing on what looks like a lemonade stall...\n","The first thing you notice when you look around is the grand piano.  Along\nanother wall you see a huge stereo system with a cabinet beside it filled \nwith a variety of cds and tapes.  Along the other wall is a huge fluffy \ncouch and as you look around..you can see many of different paintings and\nposters.  In the background, you can hear soft music playing.  This room\nmakes you so comfortable that you feel as if you could stay here forever.    \n","As you step into this room and look around...you see many books on the\nsurrounding shelves.  There is a cozy firplace and a mantle at the other\nside of the room.  A large oak desk and comfortable leather chair on one \nside of the fireplace and a nice leather couch on the other.  This room \nseems perfect if you need somewhere quiet to go or to get some work done.\n**                \n","You step out of the conservatory throught a sliding glass door to a breath\ntaking view of the scenery.  There is a long winding path leading to a \nsmall bridge.  Flowing under the bridge is a quiet babbling brook.  In\nthe distance you see enormous Mountains towering encompassed with the \nbright blue sky and fluffy white clouds.  To the right is a porch swing\nand to the left, a wooden picnic table.  With all the beautiful trees and\nflowers, you would suspect that there are many little animals running \naround out here!\n","It seems as if you have stumbled into Zaids Ode to America room!  As you look\nto the right...you can see an attempted replica of Mc Donalds.  To the far\nleft is a huge stolen \"Cedar Point...the Amazement Park\" sign.  Directly on \nthe other side of the room...across from you is an antique Seaburg 200 jukebox.\nThe center of the room is cleared...for those who like to dance.  To finish\noff the room...is a big screen tv hooked up to a vcr and nintendo.  With all\nthe movies and games...it is obvious that you would have nothing but fun in\nthis room!\n","As you enter this room you become instantly aware of the mess, piles of papers litter the floor and a Cd player sits in the corner playing \" Lucy ...\" A bed sits in another corner and posters of Pink Floyd are posted all over.It looks like a any room.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",})
