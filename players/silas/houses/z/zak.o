The two verdant house plants that frame the doorway rustle with life. The vortex of tasteful purple and yellow swiring mists seems to lead back to the church.\n","You enter the sky room in Zak's apartments.\nThe walls here are made out of slightly reflective skyblue glass through which you can see nothing except deeper blues and turquoises.\nAs you look up you realize something is missing.\nThe ceiling. \nAll that is above you is white fluffy clouds and deep blue sky.\nNearer the tops of the walls the sky seems to blend with the room.\nThe strong pillars which are at each corner of the room look like they support th sky,\nThe circular brazier in the middle of the room is blazing with a constant 5foot high flame, which warms this area considerably.\nThe floor is paved with tidy, white stoned, crazy paving.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
