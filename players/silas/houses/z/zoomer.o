It seems you are no threat, and may enter.\n","In the castle's main courtyard, you stand stunned by the wild festivity.  To\nthe east sits a low hall, from which the sounds of drunken revelry flow.  North\nof you lies the main hall, where the chieftain sits in judgement.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","It is hard to see in here because of the smoke given off by the roasting pits.\nAs your eyes adjust to the dim light, you realize that you have stepped into the\nmiddle of a great feast.  While the warriors boast of their latest victory,\nservants tend the roasting boars.  It seems the golden mead is flowing freely\ntonight.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,})
