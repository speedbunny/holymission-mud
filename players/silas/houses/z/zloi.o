An archway leads to another chamber through the west wall, back on the\nnorth wall is an entrance to the Wedding Chapel of Illuvatar.  In the east\nwall you notice the entrance to a small side room, the church portal opens to\nthe south. You feel the peace and holiness of this place and you are sure the\ngods would punish the sacrilege of shedding blood here.\n","You are at an open green place south of church.\nYou can see a road further to the east. To the\nsouth you see a small, warm, friendly looking\nhut. Perhaps you should go in?\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
