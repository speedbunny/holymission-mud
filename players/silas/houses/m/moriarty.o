You see a golden chandelier suspended from the ceiling.  A glasscase is along the wall to the east.  Beside the western wall sits a ratherstrange statue.  Also, the walls are lined with vivid portraits.  Thereare ten of them and they appear to be pictures of people with whomMoriarty adventures.Your footsteps echo throughout the otherwise silent chamber.","This room gives you quite a different feeling than the first.  Conservativebrowns and comfortable furniture adorns the living room.  On the north wallis a large sofa flanked by two endtables. In one corner sits Moriarty'sfavorite chair.  A large entertainment center sits across from the chair.Despite the comforting appearance, you still feel a chill run down your spine.","This room is a library where Moriarty keeps his important books anddocuments.  The walls are lined with shelves and shelves of books.  A large oak desk sits off to one side of the room.  On the opposite side,there is a steel file cabinet.  You notice the shelves on one wall areinterrupted by an expensive liquor cabinet.  Next to the cabinet is aglobe sitting atop a small rack.You actually feel at peace in this room.","The master bedroom is an ornately furnished room with all thetrappings of luxury.  Moriarty comes here to relax among thecomfortable lounge chairs and king-size waterbed.  Beside thebed is a small nightstand.  On the other side of the room is adesk and a dresser with a large mirror.  A wardrobe is to thenorth.","A huge table dominates what is obviously the dining room for Moriartyand his guests.  There are eight chairs around the long table.  Agolden chandelier is suspended over the center of the table from theceiling.  There is a painting on each of the four walls.  This roomseems very tranquil.To the west, you notice a large sliding glass door leading out to abalcony","This balcony overlooks a scenic view of the rolling hills below theestate.  You are struck breathless by the view as you grip the ironrail that surrounds the balcony.  After you examine the view, youturn your attention to the furniture on the balcony.  There is asimple round white table and a set of chairs where you can makeyourself comfortable and pass the day here.","The kitchen sports many modern appliances and conveniences.  A largecounter for food preparation is in the center, along with a sink.Circling the room you find a refrigerator, a dish washer, another sink,an oven, a microwave, cabinets, and drawers.  From the looks of things,you would guess that a large meal is being prepared soon.You notice a little sign hanging by a window next to the oven.","The guest room is the most unassuming room of the house.  A largerectangular bed sits in the middle of the room.  To the left, there isa dresser and a closet and to the right there is a desk and chair. Nextto the bed is a smallish window.  The curtains, bedsheets and rug allhave the same red pattern to them.  A portrait hangs over the desk. Youspy a box under the bed.","You have entered the austere private offices, where ProfessorMoriarty obviously runs his secret operations.  There is anarray of chairs around a half-moon table at one end of the room.A projection screen hangs over the table.  At the other end ofthe room sits a large oak desk with a plush swivel chair behindit.  A large global map is mounted on the wall above the chair.Several computer mainframes obscure the wall to the north.  Theentire room looks busy.","This place looks unpleasant!  It's Moriarty's torture chamber -the place where his displeasing company ends up!  The chamberis dark and shadowy.  Among its prominent features are a deeppit, a spikey case, and a whipping stone.  You also notice ahangman's gallows and a real nasty looking black box with a bigblade protruding from the top of it.  You hear sounds of anguishand torment around you, especially from the pit below.  Youwonder how you ended up here and decide to leave immediately!As you turn to go, you see:Bill, the Chief Torturer",})
