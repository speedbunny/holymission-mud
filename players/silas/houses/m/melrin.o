rooms_desc ({"As you walk into this room the elegance of Melrin's home is seen.  Torches\nbrightly light up this space.  Plush carpets made of Sabre-Tooth Tiger\nfur stretch from wall-to-wall.  Several mystical portals can be seen, \nleading to a variety of locations.\n","This Hallway connects the Grand Enterance to other rooms in the house.  It is\nlit up with many torches, and has plush carpets on the floor.\n","As you pass through the door from the Grand Enterance, the smell of roses\nand lilacs waft through the air.  From this, one can tell they have\nentered the Garden.  The environment is a peaceful one, and could be used\nto rest or a variety of other activities.  In the center of the Garden\nthere is a fountain.  Near it is a bench, and a sign is near the western door\n","This outdoor shrine is dedicated to the deeds of Akira, once Warrior\nto the Vagabonds, mentor to Melrin, and now Wizard of the MUD.  This\narea is surrounded by a strange aura, which is created by the enormous\nstatue near the altar.  His presence can be sensed by all who enter.\n","This room is filled with books...everything about every topic possible.\nThere is very comfortable furniture ranging from a leather couch to a\ndesk where the Master does his research to several tables and chairs\nfor general studies.  The room is well kept...despite the amount of books\nin it.\n","South here of the Garden is a huge lake.  Its waters are calmly flowing\neasternly and makes a swooshing noise as it moves.  Overhead, you see\nseveral seagulls flying overhead, diving into the water to catch a fish\nin its mouth.  To the west, a beautiful sunset can be seen, very tranquil\nsight to be seen.\n","This room is the armoury of Melrin, Guild Warrior of the Vagabonds.\nYou may leave weapons, armour, scrolls, etc that you may need for \nlater adventuring.\n","This is the ante chamber to Melrin's Bedroom.  It is heavily decorated with\nvarious animal heads, furs, kegs (he killed these himself), and bottles\nof liquor.  To the north is the door to Melrin's Bedroom...step in (only\nif you are female and a willing partner).\n","This room is obviously the bathroom...In the middle of the room there is a \nhuge tube like object.  The water is heated, and you can note steam coming\noff of the water.  Around it are candles lit and there are various bottles\nof ointments, bath oils, etc ready to be used.\n","This room is a fully functional babe trap.  There is a bed in the middle of the room (king size of course) covered in silk sheets.\nIn the background you can faintly hear Depeche Mode's ONE CARESS playing.\nA fire glows warmly from a fireplace built into the eastern wall.\n",})
