To the west is an egg.\nTo the south is the Entrance.\n","This is Mork's Observatory. He is very appreciative of the stars!\nIt has a high dome ceiling and marble floors.\nIn the center of the room is a rather large telescope.\nTo the west is the Atrium. To the north is a porch\n","You have walked out onto a large stone porch that overlooks Cresent Lake.\nThere is soft moonlight surrounding you and Orion is in the west. Feel\nfree to stay and relax for as long as you like\n","You are now in and egg. This is the spaceship which brought Mork to\nHoly Mission. There are several complex components all around you. \nYou think that you had better not touch anything.\n","This is a room FULL of muscial instruments and components.\nThere are several speakers placed strategiaclly around the room.\nMork has a kick ass stereo set up here. You wonder if it could \nshake the whole MUD down. A tremendous collection\nof music is against one very large wall. You can't seem to find \nanything missing from it at all! This is definately the coolest place in the ho\nhouse!\n","You have now entered the sauna of Mork's home.\nThere is also a jacuzzi of to the right that looks VERY relaxing.\nThe room is kinda steamy and everything seems like a natural aphrodisiac.\nMight as well sit back and enjoy the setting.\n","This is just a room.\n","This is Mork's Library. He has several nice collections from \ndifferent authors. He has only recently started his collection\nthough so it is still somewhat small.\n","You step over the edge of a bottomless pit. This take you as\nsomewhat of a suprise. It sure looked like there was a floor!\nYou are endlessly falling which makes you nervous at first.\nThen you realize how relaxing free falling is. \nYou notice the same room keep passing by to the north as you fall.\nThis is definately a very odd place!\n",})
