You wonder who lives here. At a closer examination you discover an imprint near the door. It says 'McLoud'. You have a strange schizophrenic feeling. You sense danger and peace, malevolence and benevolence, life and death at the same time. You feel the urge to run away and stay here forever.\n","You entered in a huge room. You realize it has to be the living-room. Due to the big space the furniture is sparsely arranged. In one of the corners there is a small kitchen.\nThere is something strange in this room and you soon realize that there is a mixture of styles in it. The furniture, different pictures on racks, statues all vary from ancient and prehistoric to postmodern. But in the disorder, the flow of styles there is some perplexing harmony. Suddenly you realize that minutes have passed since you entered the room.\n","This is a big round shaped place. It is dusky. The only light seems to come\nfrom the glow of metal on the walls. They are full of weapons you could\npossibly immagine and many you have never dreamed of. The variety is\nstrucking. From the most brutal clubs to the most rafinate spanish rapiers.\nIn front of the entrance on the wall there is a katana. The sheath is\nblack and there is some sort of black band on the grip. On closer\nexamination you can see that it is ivory with rich engravings. It seems\nworn. Who knows how many lifes have felt the cold of its metal.\nThe cold of the metals contrasts with the comfortable couch situated in the\ncenter of the room. Somehow this place radiates some majestic style.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
