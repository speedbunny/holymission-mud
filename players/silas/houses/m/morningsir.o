All around there is weed growing above your height.\nYou hack through the foliage but you find nothing but another weed.\nAfter a long time you spot a flashing light move quickly on the sky.\nYou remembered that to the east there should be a big international\nairport where you sent your parents last year. To the west you see\npretty high hills separating this country from the hell. You can hear\nsome weird noises come from north momentarily, but you're not\ninterested in sex, are you? You also noticed two pipes with signs\nstretching from the ground, one to the church and other to the shop.\n","You arrived at the top of the valley. You can see a large plain full\nof weeds to the south while to the southwest you noticed high murky\nmountains called High Tislagsux. You shiver with fear as you watch the\ncloudy atmosphere above it. All of a sudden you heard a strange sound\ncoming from the east. You recognized a Boeing 747 landing on the runway\nof the Int. Airport Old York. There is also a path through the\nweeds leading south.\n","You made it to a place with a sign. You hate all the mosquitos, but\nyou are helpless and all you can do is just hope they wont eat you alive.\nThe mountain forest is much denser to the west while to the east you can\nsee large plains stretching to infinity. Suddenly you heard someone just\nfired a full clip of a M14. You hide behind a big bush and you saw a regiment\nof black dressed soldiers running quickly in the western direction. From\nthat moment on you heard guns firing and men yelling orders until you heard\nan awesome yelling of many people and shouts for help. Then the forest become\nsilent again. You also saw blood stains and about 18mm bullets lying all around.\n","You are in the Morningsir's workroom. It is evidently placed inside the\nSun and you feel you ass make rough sounds and smells as it slowly gets fried\nin this terrible heat. There is one more thing interesting in this room:\nYou can see a mirror in which you better don't dare to look.\n","Yeah, you happily made it in this asshole! You can see an exit leading\nout south, but the ass is closed right now, try later. :]\n","You have just arrived to the International Old York Airport. There is\nnothing more than a high control tower and a pretty dirty runway with\na lot of old crap lying in piles on it. You wonder why the runway is\nonly 30 metres long but miles wide!?! :) Suddenly you hear a buzzing \nsound coming from your six and yelling something about may days...\nHeh, the crash was cool, but the pilot hit the silk. Lucky guy! *grin*\nThe more you watch the sky the less you can see with your blinded eyes.\nBut alas! You saw him at least! HE MUST HAVE BEEN -IDLE- AGAIN!!!\nYeah, you recalled that Morningsir likes to fly when he's looking for\nan inspiration... You better wait and try later, you might not catch\nhim talking when he's here.\n",0,0,0,0,})
