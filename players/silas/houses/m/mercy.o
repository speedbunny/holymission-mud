rooms_desc ({"This is the Entrance to Mercy's house. There is a table standing\nin the middle of the room, with a vase standing on it. Some\nvery beautiful flowers are in the vase, and their mild\nwildflower scent fills the room. You notice a small note\nbetween the flowers.\nFurther objects in the room are a mirror and a case\nfor shoes. (Please visitors take your shoes off here,\nI don't want to spend all the time cleaning....)\n","This is Mercy's private room, where she goes to relax. The walls are the\npalest blue, reminding you of the sky. There is a window to the east,\ndraped in white curtains. Next to the window is a large white desk, with\nmany drawers. White and yellow roses overflow the desk, and her cat Alex\nsits among the flowers purring loudly.\nYou notice the rug is also white, it feels strange, like walking on the\nclouds. A large stereo system stands in one corner, the words \"...I will\nalways love you...\" coming from it.\nNear the south wall are large white bean bag chairs, piled high, one on\ntop of the other. On the north side is a large entertainment center. The\nboob tube is also on, but turned down low so you have to strain to hear\nAl Bundy bashing his wife.\nOn the entertainment center is Mercy's Elephant collection, her most\ncherished possession!\n","This is the living room. The whole floor is covered by a soft, white\ncarpet. In the middle of the room you can see a table, surrounded by\nseveral comfortable armchairs. Next to the east wall there is a small\nbut well equipped bar. In the north wall is a great window, and through\nit you can see a small garden with a large waterfall. The roar of the\nwater falling down is quite deafening...-when the window is open.\nYou can hear music coming from the west.\n","A thin white brick path leads from one end of the garden to the next.  Bushes of blood red roses line the path, which fills the air with a scent you recognize but cannot place.  In the middle of the path is a large square, which sits a marbelized statue of Mercy's lover.\nAs you look to the east you notice a small waterfall, which fills a pond with cool clean water.  Taking a second look at the pond you see a pile of clothes, a toothbrush, some soap, and small candles circling the entire pond.  \n","It's night. The wind blows warmly and gently, you enjoy as it touches your\nskin. You hear the soft sound of waves stroking the white sand of the beach.\nThe scene is so lovely with the moon shining above the sea!\nTo the south you see a beautyful garden.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
