rooms_desc ({"This is Mango's cockroach-infested rat hole.  It is under construction, so just kick back on a cardboard box, heat up a snack on the hot-plate and watch him try to fix the plumbing......it really is funny to watch!\n","A simple closet.  However, the east and west walls\nhave openings.\n","\tWhat dinner party would be complete without dancing and socializing\nafterward?  The high ceiling and marble pillars give this Grand Ballroom\nan ambiance straight from a fairy tale.  You feel as if you could float\nand glide across the highly polished stone floor forever.  The hauntingly\nbeautiful melodies eminating from a string ensemble urge you to join\nsomeone special for a dance of a lifetime.\n","\tYour nostrils fill with the cool night air.  From here, \nlife makes a little more sense as you stare into the night sky.\nNot everything depends on what monsters you kill or whether you\nwill run in a fight.  Staring into the cluster of stars you begin to see the larger \npicture of what matters most in life: friends, companionship, love and \nhappiness.  Only after staying out and staring at the heavens and the beautiful\nblack wilderness to your east do you reluctantly turn and make your way back\ninto the Ballroom.\n","\tA fully carpeted hallway.  Not too wide, but comfortable enough for two people\nto walk down arm in arm.  You wonder what is on either end and are drawn to explore it to its full length.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",0,0,0,0,})
