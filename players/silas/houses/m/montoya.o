There is a distinct oriental style to\nthe decor with paper screens against the walls and persian rugs scattered\nabout the floor. There is an oil lamp hanging low from the ceiling casting\na dim glow about the place.\n\nA strong smell of oriental cooking eminates from the north, and you can\nhear music coming from the east, while to the south you can see the swirling\npsychedelia of the portals.\nThe hallway continues west....\n\n","You are in some sort of lounge. There are more painted screens here, two of\nwhich slide to one side to form doorways to the north and west. The floor\nis completely covered by large, silk cushions of various colours. They\nlook very comfortable to sit on. Against the southern and eastern walls rests\na low, L-shaped bamboo table, on which sits a television, video recorder\nan impressive looking stereo and a SUN workstation.\n\n","You are in the western end of a hallway. There is a distinctive oriental\nstyle to the decor with paper screens against the walls and persian rugs\nscattered about the floor. There is an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling.\n\nThere is a door in each of the north and west walls, and a table\nup against the south wall. On the table is a small ash-catcher with a\nstick of burning incense held in it. There is a sweet smell in the air.\n\nThe hallway continues east....\n\n","You are in a spacious kitchen. The heat in here is intense. In the centre\nof the room is a large food preparation area aswell as several gas fire\nburners. Around the walls are many well-stocked cupboards, a stove and\nwhat looks very much like a kiln. On a unit in one corner sits a stereo\nwhich is blasting out some heavy rock music. Next to the stereo lies an\nempty CD case.\nThere are some servants bustling about preparing a sumptuous chinese meal.\nAs you wander around, the smell of various different dishes tingles in\nyour nostrils.\nThere are sliding screen doors leading to the south and east, aswell as\na serving hatch in the east wall, through which you can see the dining\nroom, while to the north there is a heavy iron door, slightly ajar,\nbeyond which you can make out a stone stairway leading down.\n","You have entered what is quite clearly the dining room. In the centre of\nthe room is a large table which stands about a foot off the ground. On\nthe table there are places set for several people with china bowls and\nchopsticks, perhaps there is going to be a banquet here later. Around\nthe table are many cushions to sit on, while on the walls hang various\noil paintings.\nIn the west wall there is a sliding screen door, aswell as a serving\nhatch, through which you can see the kitchen.\nThere are two large speakers set into the south wall, one in each of\nthe top corners. Between the speakers, in the centre of the wall, is\nanother screen door.\n","You are in a large bedroom. Your attention is immediately drawn towards the\nlarge water bed against the northern wall. The carpet feels very luxurious\nunder your feet. In the southeastern corner, through a gap in some\npartitioning screens, you can see a large circular jacuzzi. There are more\nscreens around the walls and two slide over the very secure looking doors to\nthe south and west.\n\n","You walk through the iron door and follow the stairs down into a dimly\nlit cellar. The only light is from a strange, eerie glow from the walls.\nScattered around are various bottle racks, wooden crates and barrels.\nThe only exit is back up the stairs.\n","A strange feeling of calm overcomes you as you walk into some kind of\nshrine. The sound of sitar music fills the air. Around the walls hang\nmany different weapons. There is an alcove in the west wall in which\nstands a ten foot tall golden statue in front of which lies a prayer mat.\nOn either side of the statue stand two oil burners, however they must be\nfilled with some special kind of oil, for they not only provide dim\nlighting, but fill the room with a sweet smelling, intoxicating smoke.\nThe only way out appears to be the way you came in.\n","You are in a large, domed room. Even the eastern door is formed so that the\nroom is a perfect hemisphere. In the centre of the room is a round bed with\nseveral cushions lying on it. Around the bed are several low tables covered\nwith various bits of junk and clutter.\n\nAs you close the door behind you, the phosphorescent glow eminating from the\nwalls fades to blackness and an impressive laser hologram display commences...\n\n",})
