rooms_desc ({"   This is the main room in Morbius' house, and looks like a good place\nto party.  A slight odor permeates the air and the room looks a bit worse\nfor the wear, but what would you expect from a partying fighter who is\na troll?\n   There is a stereo system on the east wall.  On the south wall is a\nfireplace with a plaque and a strange head mounted above it.  There is a\nbig screen tv near the west wall.\n   Shammy the dog is here, wagging his tail.\n   A big couch is here.\n  A weapons display case is here.\n","   This is the room that Morbius affectionately refers to as \"the Rat \nHole\".  It was a torture chamber at one time, but Morbius had it \nconverted to a secure store room.  The walls, ceiling, and floor are\nmade of big blocks of granite.  In the center of the room are all of the\ngoodies that Morbius plunders from villages or wins in battle.  This\nroom is kept under lock and key and you feel very priviledged to be here.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
