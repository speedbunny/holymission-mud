You look behind the door and see a pile\nof empty beer bottles.  Carefull, dont knock them over!  Last nights \ndishes are in the sink waiting for someone to clean them.\n","\nThis room is HUGE! It houses an entire ski resort.  The mountain towers above y\nou.  As you search for the summit, you find that it\nis conceiled above a layer of clouds (yes, indoor clouds).  The snow is\nman-made and perfectly groomed.  A cozy looking gondola is prepared\nto take you to the top of the mountain.  This hill seems to be prepared \nfor all types of skiers with all types of interests.  There is even a\nrace course set up for those with a \"need for speed\".  \nThe best part of it all, is that all of Lou's guests may ski for FREE!\n(note, please forgive Lou if the description looks funny,\neveryone on the mud insisted on shouting when he did this description)\n","You have entered Lou's massage parlor. He likes to use it after a hard\nday of skiing in his personal mountain.  If you feel like you could\nuse a massage, help yourself.  The parlor is prepared to cater to either\nsex \n","Ooops, You've stumbled into Lou's closet.  You don't see many clothes or any no\nmal things in here, but you DO see a lot of\nskeletons.  You'd better leave before you find out any more of Lou's \n\"skeletons in the closet\"\n","You have found the bedroom.  \nThe waterbed dominates the room, as well it should, it's a king size after all\nThe window over by the nightstand lets a cool breeze in to freshen the air in t\nthe room.  \n",0,0,0,})
