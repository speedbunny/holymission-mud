rooms_desc ({"This is the main hallway of Misticalla's house.  There\nare plush rugs on the floors and scented flowers scattered\nabout the room.  To the north are some stairs leading down.\nTo the south is a great room.  To the west is the kitchen.\n\n","This is a surprisingly large room with soft fluffy\ncarpet.  On one side of the room is a large hot tub\nthat also serves as a bathtub.  There are two robes\nhanging on hooks on the walls next to plush towels.\nThere are dials to turn on the jets for bubbles, and\nthe water is always warm.  There is also a shower  \nhere and the room is lined with mirrors\non the walls and on the ceiling.  There is a beautiful\nfresh flowery scent due to the candles that are placed\nin various places in the room.\n\n","As you enter you notice a distinct odor and light filtering into the room.\nYou recognize the odor as you gaze around and see a large indoor swimming\npool.  It has a diving board and a curvy slide.  There are sunning chairs\nand a few tables scattered about the wooden floor.  You notice the\nroom is entirely enclosed by glass.  You feel warmed by the sun, and are\ntempted to take a swim.  Your mind wanders to memories of an evening\ndip in the water, under the stars with someone close to you.\n\n","As you enter the garden, you are overwhealmed by the\nscent of various flowers.  You see roses of many colors,\ndaffodils, tulips, lilies, geraniums, begonias, posies,\nand orchids.  There are violets, Misticalla's favorites,\nnestled in the soft clover.  Look at each flower for a \nspecial meaning.  To the south is a door thata leads to the\nhot tub.  To the north is a mysterious door.  It\nappears to be locked.\n\n","This is Misti's kitchen.  There are all the basic necessities here.  A\nstove, refridgerator, sink, and dishwasher.  There is a round table off\nto one side of the room.  There are a few plants and flowers around the \nroom.  Help yourself to anything you desire.\n\n","This is Misticalla's torture chamber.  If you piss\nher off or upset her, this is where you wind up.\nThere is a block for chopping off heads of all sizes,\nand a large bloody axe.  A bucket sits next to\nthe block.  There are chains on the walls with\nshackles.  A long board hooked up with gears \nserves as a stretching machine, pulling apart\nit's victims limb by limb.  It is very dark\nin here and it smells terrible.  You wonder\nwhat lies in the dark corners ...\n\n","This is a balcony off of the house that leads to and\nfrom the pool.  As you gaze off in the distance you\nsee the great beauty of the mountains and hear the\nsound of a brook that runs through the land and to\na large lake.  Look at the view and enjoy.\n\n","The first thing you notice as you walk into the room is\nthe large bed in the center of the room.  There are huge\npillows on the flowered comforter.  The carpet\nis soft as you walk around the room.  You notice that\nthere are mirrors above the bed.  There is a bay window\nwith cushions for Misticalla to sit on while she reads.\nCandles light the room for a romantic atmosphere.\n\n","This room has vault ceilings and large pillars in \nthe entryways.  There is a large screen TV with\ndigital sound, a stereo with large speakers, Cd\nchanger, dual cassette, and microphone jack.  The\nTV is equipped with a Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo,\nand Sega CD.  There is a computer in one corner of\nthe room.  It has everything from CD ROM to a Virtual\nReality hookup.  To the north is the main hall.  To\nthe east is the bedroom.  There is a exit to the\nwest.\n\n","This room has vines hanging from the ceiling for\nyou to swing on.  There is a pool of water deep\nenough for you to land in.  You can splash\naround if you want.  This room serves as a \nplayroom for everyone to mess around in.  Loud music\nis playing from hidden speakers and colored lights\ncast an erie glow on the water.\n   \n",})
