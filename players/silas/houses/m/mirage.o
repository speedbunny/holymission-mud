Across from the couch is a huge entertainment\ncenter with a large-screen tv, a vcr, and a great stereo system.  To the \nright of the couch, you see a fireplace with a fire burning in it.  You \nalso notice a comfortable bench for 2 next to the fireplace.  Above the \nfireplace is a mantle with a beautiful picture on it.  The whole feeling \nof the room is very warm and cozy.  To the south, you see the enterance to \nthe house, to the east you see a jacuzzi tub, and to the north you see\na playroom with arcade games and work-out equipment.\n","You have just entered another room in Mirage's house and the first thing \nyou notice is a nice, big jacuzzi tub in the middle of the room.  The room\nis very warm and humid because of the jacuzzi tub but yet everyone seems \nto like this room the best.  To the right is a changeing room where people\ngo to get out of there clothes and get into something more appropriate for \nthe jacuzzi.  That can be anything you want.  Mirage likes to come to this \nroom a hard day of fighting or when he is with that special woman in his \nlife.  To the west you see the room where Mirage entertains his guests and to\nthe east you see Mirage's bedroom.\n","You have just entered Mirage's bedroom.  This is the most spectacular of all\nthe rooms in Mirage's home.  The room is quite large and is done in as oak-\nwood and dark green scheme.  The floor is carpeted with very plush carpeting.\nTo the left you see Mirage's bed.  The queen-sized bed has a thick, warm\ncomforter on it with dark-green satin sheets.

To the right\nyou see a wall of glass with beautiful french doors in the middle.  Through\nthe wall of glass you see a large deck and a giant waterfall.

To the west you see the jacuzzi room and to the south is \nthe beatiful deck.\n","You have just entered onto Mirage's deck.  The deck is stunningly beautiful.\nIt is made out of western red cedar, has a cedar handrail all around, and\njust takes your breath away.  After noticeing the deck itself, you look to the \nsouth and notice the most incredible waterfall you have ever seen.  The water\nis crystal clear and the sound of the water falling is the most peaceful you \nhave ever felt.  Looking around you notice woods that block anyone from ever\ngetting in.  You are quite secluded and can do what ever you like.  You also\nnotice many different bird feeders near the deck that attract all types of \nbirds including hummingbirds, sparrows, robbins, bluejays, and many others.\nLooking around on the deck you notice many comfortable chairs and a rather \nlarge picnic table.  You also see a large bar-b-que.  This is definately\na great place for Mirage to have guests or to come just to relax.  Often   \ntimes Mirage will eat meals outside here on the deck to be able to enjoy \nnature as it was meant to be.  To the north is Mirage's bedroom and to the west\nis Mirage's Kitchen.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
