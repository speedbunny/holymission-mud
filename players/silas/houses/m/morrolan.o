You do notice that this room is very\nbright and has a very large, comfortable looking sofa in the corner.\nA large dragonhead has been painted on the wall, and there is a box \nsitting in the corner of the room.\n","This is the official meeting room of the \"x's rule the mud club\". The club\nwas the original inspiration of two dangerous minds, Morrolan and Soozie, but \nevery x on the mud is automatically included in the club. Pictures of Morrolan,\nSoozie, Herp, and Plastic hang on the walls, since they are the only x's\nMorrolan knows of. If you are one and I missed you, tell me please!!! The\nclub is always looking for new members!!!!\nA large table with many comfortable chairs around it is here so people can\nsit down during official club meetings. Many papers are thrown across the\ntable in such a way that only the person who dropped them could possibly\nknow what they all are. \n","This is the main living room of Morrolan's house. There is a\ncomfortable recliner in one corner, yet another couch against the wall, \na fully stocked bar (plus some), and just about a million candles spread around the room that \nmakes it seem quite happy in here. One of the walls has been\npainted in a number of brigt colors, but the others are simply white.\nYou think you could get very comfortable here.\n","This is a special room. This is where Morrolan keeps all his stuff that he\nacquired during his trip to the 20th century. There are five different \nposters on the wall, some kind of black electronic device with two \nrectangular looking things attached to it by some kind of strange rope.\nThere are also two pieces of some kind of flattened scroll sitting \non the corner of a large table.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,})

items ({({"sofa","A large, comfortable looking black leather sofa. However, you do notice that    one of the cushions have been flattened becuase Beelzebub plops his lazy        butt on it so much.","box","An empty case of Labatt's Ice (that's beer if you didn't know). You think you  missed a great party last night","dragonhead","This is the dragonhead of the e'Drien line of the Dragons, having two green    eyes and a fierce look on it's face. (If you don't get this, ask Morrolan. He'll explain it.)",}),0,({"couch","Yet another black leather couch. (Gee, you'd think Morrolan likes black leather or soemthing.) This one is in excellent condition cause Arthur is usually so drunk when he passes out on it that he falls right off.","recliner","A large, comfortable, blue recliner. Perfect for relaxing in after a rough day killing or being killed by the same thing over and over again.","painted wall","Do NOT look at this if you've ever tripped on acid!!!!!",}),({"first scroll","It reads: The top ten reasons to play holy mission (from the home office in siox city, iowa, of course): (10) Watch Jemima strip for us (9) See if Beelzebub will ever get married (8) Quests are so much fun (7) Daniella's acrobatics (6) Who really needs an education, anyway?
