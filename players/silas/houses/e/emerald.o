rooms_desc ({"A magnificent grand piano fills the middle of the room.  A marble fireplace in along the west wall, giving a cheery glow to the room.  Candles are set on the fireplace, helping to illuminate the room.  Underneath the piano lies a red and blue oriental rug\n","This terrace is overflowing with greenery.  Roses climb trellises, herbs    grow in pots along the edges, and mosses thrive in the cracks between the bricks\n","The fireplace from the main room also has an opening in the east wall of the \nbedroom.  A set of french doors on the north wall lead to the verdant garden\noutside.  A nice, soft bed with plenty of room for two takes up the south\nwall.  Thick carpetting gives plenty of cuchioning to tired feet.\n","The sound of rushing water completely fills your ears in this watery paradise\nA large pool of clear water has a few lazy goldfish swimming about in the\nsun.  Water lilles bloom in profusion, filling the air with their sweet\nfragrance.  A cobbled path leads east and west.\n","You are on a curving cobblestone path that winds through lush vegetation.\nBrilliant flowers line the path, scenting the air with their delicate\nfragrance.  Hummingbirds and butterflies flit through the air, bouyed by small\nunseen breezes.  Trees line the path to the west, which leads to a pool.\n","The path ends here, leading in to the bedroom.  Large shade trees line the\npath at this end, providing an escape from the sun.  More herbs and flowers\nare to be found, as well as large bushes which screen the French doors,\nensuring privacy for the occupants of the bedroom.\n","Beautiful mosaic tiles form intricate designs on the floor and walls.  \nSteam rises from a large soaking tub filled with rose-scented water.  \nEverything necessary for cleaning and soothing the spirit seem to be in this\nroom.\n",0,0,0,})
