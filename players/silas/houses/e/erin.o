rooms_desc ({"You have entered Erin's first apartment.  It is not very spacious but is decorated very lushly but cheaply.  A used carpet covers the floor.  Pillows are everywhere and candles are stuck in bottles of every shape and size.  The only furniture in the room are a number of crates full of records and some boards making up a shelf to hold a fairly decent stereo.  Various colorful posters cover the walls and a black light illuminates those with the brightest colors.  It is a room made for comfort, but except for the stereo, cost practically nothing.  What a Smart and Thrifty girl, albiet sensuous.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
