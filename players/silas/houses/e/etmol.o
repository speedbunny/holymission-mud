You feel a kind of peace you have\nnot met for a long time here. \nTo the west stands the house itself; a large, brown house \nmade of wood (built by Etmol himself).\n","Welcome to Etmol's house. This is the hall. To the west you\nsee the entrance to the living room, the kitchen is to the south\nand the bathroom is to the north. \nBefore you proceed any further however, you are kindly requested\nto leave all your weapons here, as Etmol would not like any\nweapons inside his house. You are assured that you'll get everything\nback before you leave. Thank you.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
