Many chemical and magical things are stored here. It would be wise not to touch ANYTHING.\n","This is Eorl's library; here many books - magical and normal - are stored and well protected.\n","Now you have entered an ordinary storeroom. Many things are stored here, but you see nothing valueable.\n","This is the Kitchen. Here all the fine meals are prepared for the MASTER and his guests.\n","You are standing in the living room. There are many comfortable chairs, sofas and couches standing here. Looks like the optimal\nroom for relaxing.\n","You have entered Eorl's sleeping chamber. There is a huge bed standing in the middle of the room. Warm furs cover the floor and\na fireplace is emitting a fine warmth.\n","Hot steam fills the whole room; here you can remove the dirt from adventuring.\n","Two beds, a table, a wardrobe and a few chairs are in this room. It seems to be sort of a guest chamber.\nSurely you will find rest here.\n",})
