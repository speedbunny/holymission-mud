A figure of a musician on the gate, surrounded by musical\nnotes, catches your attention.  There is a long asphalt driveway, \nsurrounded by trees of all types, adding to its serenity, with little\nanimals darting in and out.  Large pillars loom before you, adding to the\nmagnificence of this house.  There is a huge door to the east, and you have\na feeling that more surprises await inside.\n","You are standing in the foyer of Elvis's house.  You can't help but marvel\nin its splendor.  You are standing beneath the largest chandelier that you\nhave ever seen.  To your left lies the dining room, with a large table \nthat is customary of mansions.  Flowers are scattered about the room.  To\nyour right lies the living room, and a couch of unbelievable size catches\nyour attention.  The decorations are very modest, and pictures of Elvis's\nMUD friends dot the wall, to the right and left.  In the back of the room\nlies the music room, which is separated from the living room by a huge\nstained glass entryway.  A piano is back here, and you get the feeling that\nElvis spends his quiet moments here.  To the east of the foyer is a grand\nstaircase going up, and to the north a stairway goes down.\n","You ascend the grand staircase, leaving the downstairs behind.  You come\nfinally to the master bedroom, and you immediately notice something peculiar\nabout it.  The whole room, and all of its decorations, are entirely black.\nThe walls are a deep black, and there are no windows in this room.  All of\nthe lights are very dim, but you are able to discern a HUGE waterbed in the\ncenter of the room, made up with a black satin bedspread and sheets.  There\nis also an entertainment center in the corner of the room, along with a \nmassive shelf of books.\n","You are now in Elvis's TV room.  In the back of the room is a narrow\nstaircase, leading to the foyer.  The walls and ceiling surrounding the \nstairs are mirrored, giving you a dizzy feeling.  A bar is in the corner of\nthe room, able to furnish any thirst.  On the far wall are three TV's, so\nElvis can watch three channels at once.  Statuettes of ebony and ivory \nmonkeys are on the floor.  The carpeting is deep shag, and it makes your\nfeet disappear as you walk on it.  Stacks of CDs are in the corner, and a\nstereo is here also.  This stereo pumps music to every room in the house.\nThe furniture here is all white leather, including a couch that Elvis likes\nto nap on.  A hallway leads west, and the stairway leads to the foyer south.\n","You are now in a room of seemingly limitless size.  Upon entering, you didn't\nthink that this room was very big, but now that you see it, it is enormous!\nThis is the MUD room, where Elvis likes to brag of his adventures while \nplaying Holy Mission.  Pictures on the wall depict some of his MUD memories,\nas well as the numerous trophies of beasts he has killed.  On one wall is \na case containing the many weapons Elvis has used, now on permanent display\nand not really usable.  A small gold and ivory altar is in the corner of the\nroom, with torches on both sides.  In the middle of the room lies an immense\ncrystal ball, held by a statue created in the likeness of a large dragon.  A\ntiny staircase leads north, and the TV room is to the east.\n","You hear the sound of water running.  You look around and realize that you\nare in the famous Jungle Room.  The running water sound comes from a live\nwaterfall, running down the side of the wall.  The floor, the walls, and even\nthe ceiling is carpeted in green, yielding near-perfect acoustics in case\nElvis wants to jam with some friends.  There are tiki torches on the wall\nalso, but they are not lit.  The furniture is distinctly Hawaiian, with\nwide-armed, Polynesian chairs and varnished wooden tables.  You feel as though\nyou are at a luau, because Hawaiian music is playing as well.  Posters from\n\"Blue Hawaii\" and \"King Creole\" are hanging on the wall.  You notice a bright\nlight where the hall continues to the east.  You can also go back to the \nMUD room south, or go outside to the north.\n","You now enter Elvis's game room.  You notice that it is a stark contrast\nto the bright, white hues of the TV room.  Elaborately-woven tapestries\nhang on the wall, depicting medieval scenes.  The tapestries are gathered\nin places, adding to the effect.  The tapestry on each wall is unique, and\nworthy of a closer look.  The carpet is a royal red, and like all the other\ncarpeting, is very soft.  A pool table is the centerpiece of this room, and\na rack of pool cues hangs on the wall.  On the east wall is a line of video\ngames, and in keeping pace with the times, a virtual reality game is also in\nthe corner.  The furniture is scarce here-- only a small couch sits along \nthe north wall.  A stained glass light fixture hangs above the pool table,\ncompleting the decor of the room.  The doorway leading west goes back to\nthe TV room.\n","You now find yourself outside in the sunshine.  You are in Elvis's pool\nand garden area.  A pool of modest size is in the middle, with a diving area\nand sliding board at the deep end.  It is surrounded by a black iron fence,\nto separate it from Graceland's glorious garden.  There is a wall\ntravelling the length of the garden.  It is said to be from Europe and can\nbe traced back to the 12th century.  It does look old, but extraordinarily\nbeautiful.  Meanwhile, in the garden hundreds of species of flowers and bushes\ncall this place home.  A glorious scent fills the air from all the flowers\nand bushes.  You find this place very peaceful, almost heavenly.  A lovely\nfountain tops off this scene.  You can go south back into the house, or\ngo east to another part of the building.\n","As you walk into this room, you are almost blinded by the brilliant flash\nof gold that meets you.  Welcome to Elvis's Hall of Gold, in which is housed\nmost of his gold and plantinum records.  Needless to say, the records in this\nplace are over a hundred in count.  A large platinum album in the corner\nsignifies sales of a billion records worldwide.  This corner also\nhouses Elvis's three Grammys, which were for, ironically, gospel recordings\nand not rock songs.  Also in this hall are outfits that Elvis has worn for\nshows, jewelry, and paintings sent to Elvis by adoring fans.  Plaques from \nthe city are also here, thanking Elvis for his generous donations at\nChristmas.  As you leave you see, written on the wall, Elvis's favorite\nquote to the critics.  It reads, \"Don't criticize what you\ncan't understand... you never walked a mile in that man's shoes.\"\nA door leads to the north, and back to the Jungle Room to the west.\n","You enter this room, and suddenly you realize that two atmospheres \nsuddenly come together.  In one half of the room, which is enormous, is a\nfull-sized gym, complete with free weights, Nautilus machines, and exercise\nbikes.  There are mirrors along the walls in the weight room.  In the\nopposite corner of this side is a jacuzzi, sauna, and a large racquetball\ncourt where Elvis takes all challengers.  However, on the other side of the\nroom is a nightclub atmosphere, with about twenty tables dotting the area.\nServants are bringing out fine dishes, filled with cuisine from all over\nthe world.  There is a stage at the head of the room, and bands of all types\nare constantly playing.  You feel as though you are in Las Vegas.  A door\nleads south back to the Hall of Gold, and another door heads west.\n",})
