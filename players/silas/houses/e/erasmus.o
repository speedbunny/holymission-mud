There's a sign on a wall.\n","This is the green salon. It's the place where Master Erasmus likes to meet friends and drink a good cup of coffe with them discussing the infinite problems of life.\nThere is a big table in the middle of the room with comfortable chairs placed around the table. On the walls are big shelves full of ancient books. To the north is a smaller table with a big can standing on it. To the west is a big window. And to the east is a big portal made of stone which glows green.\n","This is the Bridge of the famous U.S.S. Enterprise. It seems that there's not much to do for the whole crew since they are in orbit of Holy Mission. Picard is said to have joined the Mage's guild and Worf acts as Erasmus' pet. Bad luck for Klingons.\n","This is the inner sanctum of Erasmus' house. You can hear nice trancy music and  have a good time here...\nThere are shelves to keep Erasmus' items.\n","This a chamber made of black glowing lava... There are three giant Dragons stareing at you.... They seem to be hungry....\n","This is Holodeck 3 of the famous U.S.S. Enterprise. There is now a program running simulating a green meadow for Erasmus' pet-cow.\n",0,0,0,0,})
