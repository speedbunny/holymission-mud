An oak mantle juts out from it to allow Enterprise to place various knick-knacks along it.\nTwo Black Recliners rest diagonally from one another in front of a set of French doors which lead north onto the deck.  Enterprise spends many a nights sitting in one of these comfortably soft chairs daydreaming about her future...\nAn imitation, white, Bearskin rug rests in front of the fireplace; it's glass eyes stare at anyone who happens to stare at it.\nA navy blue, shag carpet covers the entire living room floor from one wall to the other.  The same mahogany panelling covers the walls in here as they do in the Foyer.  A long, overstuffed, velvet, crimson-red couch rests directly in front of the fireplace so that those who sit upon it may stare into the hypnotic flames that dance around.  A matching loveseat  rest along the east wall.\nAn exit leads south from here to a long hallway.\n","As you walk down this hallway, the white shag carpet pushes softly against your socked or bare feet.\nLarge white bricks make up the walls of the hall.  Candleabras connect to this white brick light the hall during the day and the night.\nPictures, paintings, and drawings of mythological creatures dance along the bricks, taunting everyone who looks at them.  They seem to be staring at you...they seem alive behind the glass imprisioning them.  Touch them...feel the fantasy and myth behind them.\nAs you look at them...you find yourself entering another room\n","As you scan the view, your lungs breath in the fresh air.  You see the beautiful sunset lowering onto the glassy ocean.  If you wish...you may rest on the porch swing and rock back and forth, staring out forever into the distance.  Mixtures of Pine and Maple trees invade your vision every now and again.  However, they only add to the splendor.\nAs you look out onto the ocean, you notice a sailboat resting next to a small dock.  Feel free to take her and try battling the fierce winds you will find on that ocean.  Feel free to walk along the beach, hand in hand with the one you love...Use your imaginations\n","Beautiful green plants, and magnificent roses and other types of flowes meet your gaze and your nose.  You look up to see yourself staring up into the sky.  Light streams down to touch your face and caress your skin.  A gently breeze ruffles your hair from an open window.\nExits lead south, east, west, and back the way you came.\n","This medium-sized room is where Enterprise shows all of her friends how well\nshe can cook.  Luckily, there is a fire extinguisher in the corner behind\nthe door.  Looking out of the window over the stainless steel sink, you can\nsee tall foliage as green as an emerald.  A black, Whirlpool dishwasher rests next to \nthe cedar cabinet below the sink.  Various other cedar cabinets line the \nwall and the floor where dishes are hidden.  Royal blue linoleum patterns\nthe floor of this room.  A small, six-seater, oak table with matching chairs\nrests on a Persian rug in the center of the kitchen.  A few hanging ferns\nand spider plants protrude from teh ceilikng as you scan the room.\n","A Full-sized, four poster bed rests on a dark brown rug in this room.\nAn oak nightable, and a cedar vanity dresser rest nearby.  The bed rests in front of a large window, covered by navy blue drapes.  The \nroom itself is pretty bare.  Enterprise leaves it up to the guest to bring in some items if the person wishes to stay vover one night.  A door leads north into the bathroom.\n","A queen size canopy bed rests against one mahogany wall where pictures of her family rest next to it on a little nighttable.  An oak, walk in closet holds all of her clothing.  Beautiful flowers and green plants hang in the sparse corners of the room where decoration is needed.  A small chandelier hangs above the bed.  There is another room.  Why don't you check it out?\n","You find yourself in a well decorated bathroom.  A burgundy toilet and matching bathtub rest on the floor side by side.\nA medicine cabinet protrudes from the cedar panelled wall, you see yourself in\nthe mirror and you make a face...:)  A white cabinet rests below the pinegreen sink and\ncontains all the toiletries one may need for using the bathroom.  When you are finished...please wash your hands...and soft pinegreen rug rests on the floor for one's barefeet after stepping out of the shower.\n","This is a room where Enterprise can relax.  Only she may use her whirlpool...unless you ask for permission to enter.  The room itself is very dark, lighted only by candles surrounding the jacuzzi.  Enter at your own risk.\n",})
