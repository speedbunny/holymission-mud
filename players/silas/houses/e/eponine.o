rooms_desc ({"You look around and see Catherine's house. \nShe spends most of her time sitting in front of the mac\ntyping. She also spends a lot of time sleeping, exhausted\nfrom work.\nThe furniture is sparse, a couch, a table - littered with\nbooks and magazines - a black carpet, and the computer desk.\nThe desk is cluttered with papers and empty soda cans. There are\ncables running all over the room, taped down to the floor. It's a mess.\n","This is where Epo tries to cook. You see a table and a few chairs to sit upon.\nYou can smell what used to be dinner in the oven.\n\nThrough an arched doorway, you can see Eponine's bedroom.\n","This is Eponine's bedroom, where she spends too much time asleep.\nThe heavy curtains are drawn closed, and the only light comes from the many lit candles around the room. There is a large bed against one wall, covered in silkysheets. Epo's cat is asleep there...\nYou see a bubbling hot tub in the corner, inviting you in. There is soft        classical music playing out of unseen speakers, adding to the seductive tone of the    room. You can smell the sweet air from the northern balcony.\n","You push apart the drapes, and step onto Eponine's balcony.\nYou can see the New York City skyline here, minus the fog and smoke. There\nare a few dead plants lining the low walls, as Epo is not a gardener at all.\nYou can see some comfy looking chairs and a low table here, and the\nsunlight plays on your face. This is a very comfortable place to sit and relax.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,})
