Candles flicker gently, and you hear the strains of soft music coming from another room.  The walls arepainted in pale yellow, and the decor is mainly in blue, and you know that these are Hakan's favorite colors!  There are several hand-made embroidered pictures on the walls, and a portrait of Hakan and her husband Barefoot ona desk.\n","This is Hakan's new music room.
