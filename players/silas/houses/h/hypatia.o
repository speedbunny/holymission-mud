Upon entering a tingling sensation surrounds you,\na glow fills your senses..your dry, and at peace.  This\ncave is pretty empty, dust is everywheres and through\nthe haze you can just make out a very old machine that\nhums and pulsates softly.  There is red glowing button on the \nfront that says 'press at your own risk'.....should you?\n","Upon entering a light beam shines upon you and grows \nbrighter and brighter, you feel strange,\na sick feeling rolls around you....you scream in terror\nas you are held immobile, you cannot move. Suddenly \nthe light flashes and you again find yourself\nin a strange place and there are glowing portals are in all \ndirections\n","With a flash of light, an energy pulsates through you \nand your transported to your destination.  Its sandy,\nhot and very arrid. For miles and miles there tall sand \ndunes and you feel so lonely. But as your eyes clear  \nmore you can make out a weather beaten tent, a small\nstagnent pool of water, and a dirty camel thirstly\ndrinking.  \n","This tent is quite luxurious despite its outward\nappearance.  Quite large infact.  Brightly colored\ndownfilled cushions are laying in one corner.  A small\ntable is in the center with a refreshing pitcher of\nwine, fruit and nuts laid upon it.  Candles shed \ntheir soft glow and insense fills the air with a \ndelightful aroma.  A soft pulsating circular light is\nto the east. Should you check it out?\n","Upon entering a light beam shines upon you and grows \nbrighter and brighter, you feel strange,\na sick feeling rolls around you....you scream in terror\nas you are held immobile, you cannot move. Suddenly \nthe light flashes and you again find yourself\nin a strange place and there are glowing doors in all \ndirections\n","With a flash of light, an energy pulsates through and\nyou feel like your body is fragmented into a million\npieces as you arrive at your destination.  Hey, your\nfloating, feel light as a feather. What is going on \nhere? Gazing around you see a small circular room with\nmany tiny windows.  There is an open steel door north.\n","This cabin is very comfortable looking and a melodious\nvoice whispers to you 'Welcome to the ship Volcanya'.\nMake yourself comfortable for it may take years to reach\nyour destination.  In one corner is the ships computer,\nwhich hums and beeps at you. A comfortable looking water\nbed lies against one wall. A small table with ivory\nchess set and two glasses is in another corner and a food-\no-cyclar is next to it. A door leads into a small wardrobe\ncloset.\n","Your at the end of a long line....wonder how long this will take.\nThe smell of some awesome cooking makes your stomach grumble a bit.\nAhead of you is the worlds greatest rides ever made.  Its \ncalled the \"Hearts Desire\".  As you look at it you wonder what\ntype of a ride it might be and is it safe to enter.\n","Stepping lightly up you gaze around at the slowly turning carosel.\nYou giggle lightly to see that the horses bow magically before you.\nYou beckon your special somone to join you in a chariot...pulled by\na team of glistening white horses and decorated with brilliant white \norchids.  The music playing merrily in the background is the\ntune of \"You will always be beautiful in my eyes and sounds charming\nas you feel the breeze touch your face lightly.  You can exit\nwhenever you like.  Be careful as the platform revolves slowly and\nstep off at your exit.\n","Hearing the sounds of cascading water you peer\naround in amazement. Before you is a gorgeous waterfall\ncascading into a sparkling crystal clear pond. The ground\nis rock strewn and sheer craggy cliffs surround it. Pink\nwaterlillies float on the ponds surface, goldfish swim\nwithin.  Frogs ribbit a merry tune.  A small path takes\nyou to the waterfall and disappears at the edge..should\nyou explore it?  \n \n",})
