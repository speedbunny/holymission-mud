On one of the\nwalls you notice a red-glowing sign of anarchy. The floor is\ncovered with a clear deep black layer which allows you to see\nyour own image like in a mirror. Hanging down from the ceiling\nthere's a large pyramid-shaped dark-red lamp which illuminates\nthe room in a weak red which is reflected by the walls and the\nfloor. To the south there's a door to the second hallway of\nthe house.\n","Now you have entered the second hallway of this quite\nmystic appearing house. You notice that now blue is the\ndominating colour of the room and you also notice the large\nblue-glowing pentagram which covers nearly the whole ceiling.\nThe black walls and the floor which reflects the soft glow\nof the pentagram look quite similar to the first hallway's\nsimple but impressive decoration. The only source of light\nhere is the ceiling pentagram emitting a tranquilizing\nblue.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
