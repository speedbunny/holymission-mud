rooms_desc ({"You enter a great hall decorated with trophies that Hemis has\ncollected through time and space.  Through the years Hemis \nhas accumulated quite a collection.  It ranges from the dragon\njawbone that frames the door, to a single obsidian spire that \nmarks the north exit.\n","As you enter the throne room you see first and foremost a\ngreat dragon sceleton filling the room.  This dragon is \nfar larger than anyyou have seen here in Holy Mission. It\nmust be from some far off land, brought here by Hemis to \ndecorate his home.  Upon closer examination you see the \ndragons skeleton as covered in hundreds of lesser beasts\nskeletons.  Weapons hang across the walls.  A blood red\ncarpet covers the floor exact around the edges where a \nblack marble floor is revealed.  Thick red curtains cover\nmost of the wall and in the middle of the dragon skeleton's\n mouth lies a throne, in it sits a decorated corpse, it is \nThemis, patron god of Hemis.  The spirit of righteous \njustice.  Before the throne is a cushion with knee imprints\nleft still in their surface where Hemis has kneeled times\nuncounted.\n","This is Hemis's bedroom.  the obsidian walls meld softly\ninto a black mound in the middle of the room where Hemis\nsleeps.  It is hard to distinguise the bed from the curtains\nthat fil the room.  Betond that the room is without decoration.\n","Upon entering this room a distinct sense of vertigo overcomes\nyou.  The floor is made of some crystal subtance that gives \nview to a deep chasm.  So deep in fact that your not even sure\nthat you can see the bottom.  Was that movement you just saw \ndown there?  It might have been.  Take a seat, the creatures\nbelow might make for good entertainment.\n","This room is just what is says, a room for sex.  Pillow adorn\nthe room and a statue of two naked bodies entwined stands in the\ncenter of the room.\n","A dark garden continually in shadow.  The darkness provides the plant\nlife with a light of it's own.  In the center of the garden is a black\npool that glows with it's dark energy.  Here Hemis finds solace from \nthe pains of this world, safe in the arms of his garden.\n",0,0,0,0,})
