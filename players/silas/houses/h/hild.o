Its height exceeds 3000 feet!\nMost odd, you see two giant legs in the cavern... then a metal trunk...\nthen two arms with a lasergun in them... then the head: the head of\nHECTOR, the largest battlemech and spaceship in the world!\nHe stands still in there in the dim light: his armour shines iwith a blueish\ncolour in the dim light. You see many missile slots all over him.\nYou have a strange feeling... you feel that he is watching YOU, and smiles!\nYou see a double-door in the right leg to the north.\n","You stand in the huge lift of Hector. It is large enough to carry\na B-2 bomber easily. It is from the same metal alloy that the whole mech\nwere made of. It seems to be so quick as well. You see no buttons,\nbut a bone-skull, Eddie: his eyes glow red, and if you push one of his\nteeth, it flashes in a green light. He surprisingly asks you:\nWhere do you wish to go?\nYou see the automat-double-doors of hector to the south, and you can go up.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
