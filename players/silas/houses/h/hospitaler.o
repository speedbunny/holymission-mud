A sign is bolted to the wall.\nArmed Knights stand guard at each side of the drawbridge.\nAn exit lies to the north.\n","This is the titanic and magnificent Ball Room of the noble palace.\nAbove you hang Humongous rotating dance lights and laser show equiptment.\nThe floor is highly shined and very smooth. It has a mirror-like reflection to it.\nThere is a tremendously large double staircase to your north leading upstairs.\nRefreshments are usually waiting upstairs for those invited to the many parties held here.\nYour most-gracious host, Hospitaler, will be glad to help you find your way around \nthe palace if you so need, but don't wear out your welcome or the guards outside will remove you.\nHave fun and enjoy the party, it can only get better.\nA huge clock hangs on the wall so that all Cinderella's can see what time it is, and\nso that nobody can lose track of time partying.\n","This is Hospitaler's bedroom.  \n ou hear soft music playing from a stereo system beside the bed.\nThere is an antique wooden desk along the wall.  The desk is covered with neatly arranged stacks of papers.  Probably Hospitaler's business files.\nA bookshelf stands beside the desk, and it is full of knowledge for certain.  A bedside table with a marble top sits near the head of the bed (thus it's name \"bedside\").  \nThe only exit is to the west, if the door is not locked and you can get out!\n","This is the storage room.  if you are getting to read this description then you are of a select group.  One)  Hospitaler trusts you not to steal his stuff.  \nTwo)  You are an employee of Hospitaler and number one also applies.\nThree)  You are carrying stuff to drop off for Hospitaler and one applies too.\nFour)  You are an excellent cat burgler and deserve to steal all this stuff.\nlook\nYou may see a few items scattered around the room, or neatly stacked in bags.  Most likely you are looking at bags of food or party items.  \n\n","This is the Banquet Room.\n\nHere is where everybody at a party comes to get refreshments.  Enjoy the party and enjoy the food, but don't make a hog of yourself.  Share like mom always taught you.\nTo the east you see the Western Guest room.  Hospitaler was a bit disoriented when he made it so it is named wrong.  To the west is another room used for  conventions.\nTo the north you see a long hallway with a single door at the very end.\n","This long hallway is decorated with various pieces of antique furniture and valuable artwork.\nAmong the pieces of art are portraits of Hospitaler, his girlfriend, and a few really abstract pieces titled \"Floating Triangle\", Elevator's of Earth\", and \"Golgatha\".\nGo ahead, take a look at the beautiful artwork.  Look at the furniture too.\nTo the north lies a single door with a sign bolted on it.\nTo the south lies the Banquet Hall.\n","This is the Western Guest Room\n\nYou see a very fluffy tiger-fur rug.  The Bed in the corner looks very soft and comfortable.  There is a bedside table against the wall and within reaching distance of the bed.\nA dresser and table are on the opposite wall.\nA sign hangs on the wall above the bed.\nPaintings hang on the opposite wall, and a window on another wall.\n\nMake yourself at home.\n","\nThis is a huge convention or lecture room.  There are many, many seats and tables around you.  In the corner are ancient torture devices.  You see a stretcher, hot seat, spiked bed, and a catter-nine-tale.\nThere is a rusty iron sign bolted to the wall.\nThere is a movie screen too.  This room has many uses actually.  It can be for important MUD meetings, interrogation (Hospitaler's personal favorite use), or movie viewing.\nThere are two exits.  To the north, the Warp Room.  To the east, the Banquet Hall.\n","\nThis is Hospitaler's Office.\nUsually nobody is allowed in here, but right now I guess that you are taking the welcome tour.  This is like the oval office, so enjoy the thrill of being here.  This room also serves as the butt-end of the house.  \nYou can exit from here to variouse places on the main street.  If you are leaving, then this is one of your options.\n","\nThis is the Warp Room.\nYou can go from here to many places around the main street of Holy Mission.  If you are here other than to look around, then SEE-YA! \n\"Scottie, activte transporter!\"\nThere is an exit to the east, but only Hospitaler can use it.\n",})
