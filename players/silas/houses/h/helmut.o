rooms_desc ({"A quaint entrance foyer, with old-fashioned coatracks, and artillery shell\numbrella stands.  There is a small table here, and on it is the guest\nregister.  There are AC/Heat vents in the floorboards.  The umbrella\nstands are painted yellow, red, and blue, with the words 1st AD on them.\n","This spacious room is dominated by the plate glass window on the north\nwall.  The spectacular view is of the rolling countryside of northern\nBavaria.  Inside the room are several chairs, sofas, and loveseats,\nalong with an HUMONGOUS stereo system.  There is a very large\nshelf containing nothing but compact discs, from Adolphe Adam to \nWilhelm Zittendorf.  You see a VERY well stocked bar on the west wall,\nwith several kegs of premium German beer, and just about every liquor\nknown to man.  There is a teak dining set in the southeast corner of\nthe room, and a sliver chest containing 8 sterling silver place settings.\n","A lavish, but tasteful conservatory in 18th century style.  There is\na large, grand piano in the west corner of the room, and a brass music\nstand in the middle of the room.  There is an extensive music library\non the south wall:  mostly clarinet literature.  There are magnificent\nthrow rugs on the floor, and stunning, though plain, red velvet tapestries\non the walls.  The sofas and chairs in this room match the tapestries, and\nare uniformly extremely comfortable.  There are extra music stands, chairs\nand instruments along the north wall.\n","This kitchen is everyone's dream, at least 10 metres square, and \nstocked with every acoutrement one could imagine.  Pots and\npans of all descriptions line one wall, while spices from every \nnation line the copious counter space.  There is a frig of at\nLEAST 7 cubic metres, and a freezer double that size.  The \ngrill/stove is in the center of the kitchen, allowing easy access\nto all appliances.  The drawers are full of every thought-up\nkitchen gewgaw.  There are three roller chairs so that the cooks can\nquickly scoot around.\n","This lavishly furnished bedroom is a joy to behold.  There is a large\nwaterbed in the northeast corner of the room, made up with black\nsatin sheets.  There is an antique roll-top desk next to the bed.\nIt is covered with assorted gewgaws like pens and pencils, \nunshelved scrolls, empty glasses, and other assorted papers.\nThere is a comfortable roller chair pushed up to the desk.\nThe west wall is dominated by a gigantic shelf, upon which are\nseveral VERY dusty books, and thousands of scrolls and other\nmagical paraphenalia.  There is a large, full-length mirror\non the south wall facing the bed.  You notice several posters\non the walls, including:  Nolan Ryan striking out Robeto Alomar\nto clinch no-hitter number seven, a faded picture of the\n1926 Pittsburgh Crawfords, a poster of the 1990 World Cup \nChampion German team, and a poster of the 1990 German Champion\nFC Bayern Muenchen in 1920's football uniforms.  There is a\nbeautiful painting of a gleaming castle on the east wall,\nnext to the bed.  It is marked:  Asu'a.\n","You climb a flight of stairs up to the Attic, coughing on the dust all\nthe way up. The attic is huge, and boxes stretch for what seems\nlike miles and miles. It feels as if you could spend a LONG time up\nhere searching for memorabilia, old baseball gloves, blankets,\npictures, clothes... All in all, the attic is warm and friendly, even if\nit is the dustiest place you have ever seen...\n","The bathroom is done in pastel blues and greens, soothing your eyes.\nThere are two showers here:  one large one almost 5 metres tall, and\na man-sized one with an adjustable showerhead.  There are also toilets\nto accomadate all races, and a bidet.  A large, castiron tub sits\nagainst the east wall, and a jacuzzi hums invitingly.  On the north\nwall is a sauna with a variable temperature control, ranging \nfrom 75 to 100 degrees C.\n","This room is chock full of long, high shelves loaded with bottles of every\nwine imaginable.  From 1959 Chateu Margaux, to the\nincredibly rare 1870 Chateau Lafite.  There is something here for\neveryone's tastes.  A conossieur could lose himself in here for hours.\n","This room is full of amusements.  There are billiards tables, video games,\ndartboards, and a high-tech entertainment system.  There is no south wall,\nas the room opens out onto a large pool, where bathing suits are optional.\nThe north wall houses a cozy fireplace to the left of the door, and you'd\nreally like to warm yourself there after a swim.  A deep, pile rug lies in \nfront of it.  There is a tunnel leading out to the west.  Sniff the air...\nThere is a familiar smell coming from the tunnel...\n","You walk west into a long tunnel.  Sounds of a bat striking a\nball can be heard from the end of the tunnel.  Suddenly, you emerge\ninto a vast, \"Green Cathedral.\"  A baseball stadium sprawls\nbefore you in all its splendor.  You recognize some of the great\nplayers in the field.  Mugsy McGraw at third, Dobie \"The Black Cat\"\nMoore at short, Rogers \"Rajah\" Hornsby at second, John Henry \"Pop\"\nLloyd at first, mighty Josh Gibson behind the plate, fleet of\nfoot Tris \"The Gray Eagle\" Speaker in center, George \"Mule\" Suttles\nin left, and \"Big\" Ed Delahanty in right.  Nolan Ryan steps to the\nmound to pitch batting practice.  You buy a hot dog and some fresh,\nunsalted, roasted peanuts to munch on, and a beer to slosh them down\nwith, relaxing in your box seat.  The smells are wonderful, the \nfreshness of the immaculately cut grass, the peanuts, the hot dogs,\nand of course, the all-encompassing smell of baseball...\n",})
