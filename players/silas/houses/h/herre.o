A little\njapanese table rests in the middle of the room. Directly above it hangs\nan astonishing chandelier. What a horrible mixture of styles. In a corner of\nthe room stands a desk with a chair in front of it. There is also a \ncupboard where Herre uses to put his trophees in. To the south you see\na large window.\n","As you enter Herre's little garden, a big plant snaps at you, but misses. You\nguess it's probalely a flesheating plant, but you don't want to find out.\n   The garden consists of a nice lawn, surrounded by lots of plants and\nvegetables. On the lawn stands a goat on a chain. There are also three\ndeckchairs here, of which two are occupied at the moment. In the distance\nyou can hear some Drosophilae Melanogaster buzzing.\n","You are standing in an enourmous library. You didn't know Herre mastered\n4-dimensional masonry, but then again, he is a dwarf, so why not. To your\nwest (or was it east) you see the livingroom from which you just came and you\nsure want to get back to, so you won't get lost in hyperspace. From here\nyou see a table & chair, a fireplace (out) and a vast amount of shelves\nwith lots and lots of books.\n","You are in Herre's bedroom. You wonder if he has little dwarven sized\nrubbers somewhere. Anyway, what you see is a bed, a closet and a little\ntable.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,})
