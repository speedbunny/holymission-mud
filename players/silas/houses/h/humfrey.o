rooms_desc ({"You are standing on the threshhold of Humfrey's beautiful Bel-aire estate.  To the north is the kitchen.  If you venture eastward, you head into the bathroom.  South is a private study, and to the west lies Humfrey's private bedroom.","The bathroom's to the north.Close the door when you go about you're businessto try and keep the odor out of the rest of thehouse.   I MEAN IT!","This is definitely the most beautiful bathroom you've ever had the fortune to take a dump in.  The floor is absolutely spotless, and the tub and sink are mirror-bright.  There's an eight-man jaccuzi in the northwestern corner, and the bubbles are going at full tilt.  You wish you could afford the time to slip in for a head-job from one of the beautiful women that Humfrey has hired specifically for the job.  Oh well...  You've come here for a reason, so get to it!","This vast auditorium is almost completely filled with awards and trophies from Humfrey's early daysas a high school athlete and collegiate star.The prizes range from a first place finish in hisCub Scout's pinewood derby to the 1988 football National Championship.Among his many awards for citizenship and athleticprowess hang Humfrey's prize possesions...Four human heads...Two of them are spitting images ofGravedigger, one is Wanderer, and the last one Xak.  Underneath the heads hangs an engraved plaque:	\"Death to all who oppose thievery.\"","You really don't know what the hell to make of this room.  This huge room contains just about everything necessary for the makings of a great party.  There's a fully functional kitchen along the north wall, stocked with all your favorite munchies.  On the other side of the room is a monstrous sofa-bed where you can just sitback and forget all your worries.  A sixty inch TV liesalong the west wall, depicting scenes from several of Arnold Schwarzenegger's greatest films.  Also, if you need to quit the game temporarily, this room would provide a safe place to store your gear!","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, youstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,a cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..A small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
