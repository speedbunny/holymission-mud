She has kindly uncovered a victorian couch so you can rest. OOPS mind the orange-tan cat sitting on it... Her name is Ginger, doesn't like to be pet. But don't mind that, force her , I DO! \n","\nLeisure suits are all around , in cases, layed out across the couchs\neverything is just so Elvis...\n","\nThis is Jimpa's bathroom. Blue and pink. If your male please do not leave the\nseat up. There is a big big bath, potty chair, two sinks, a couch, t.v.,\nstack of magazines, and radio. It's pretty and relaxing in here....\nSoon as your done with your business, please leave. And make sure to wash \nyour hands.\n"," \nThis is the room Jimpa comes and sits in when depressed. It's seems to be the most coveted place in the house. The walls are painted a mellow blue with drifting white clouds. \nUp on the ceiling is a fan wafting down cool air and wimsically blowing the c white curtains around the window.\nHer dear little kitty, Jimpa, is fast asleep on her fluffy white comforter.  A ladelicate blue lamp is on her dresser, with a bowl of sedatives next to it. The urge to take a nap over comes you.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","\nWhy you looking where i am , your creeping me.\nGo away and stop picking your nose, thats disgusting.\nAnd put on some pants for gods sake!\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
