rooms_desc ({"Welcome to the home of Dreamer and Joyful.  You are standing at the top\nof the stairs.  The porch is very beautiful.  On the ledge there are many\ngreen plants.  The posts are green with vines.  To the right you notice\na porch swing.  There is a terrific aroma coming from the inside.  You\nget the feeling that this is a happy home.  Come on in and stay for a \nwhile.  You are always welcome!\n","You have just entered the home of Dreamer and Joyful. This is a very \nbeautiful room. When you look down you notice the polished oak floor with\na beautiful hunter green area rug. Hang your coat up on the rack and\ncome on in.\n","This is the very beautiful and very spacious master bedroom. This room is\nvery large with a huge bed in the middle. There is a fireplace crackling\nin the corner. This room is very dimly lit, and it is very cozy. As you\nlook down you see the same beautiful floor as in the foyer. It is oak and\nvery shiny, (with a jade rug instead of hunter, because it is Dreamer's\nfavorite color). There is a sweet smell of flowers in here..it must be\nthe roses in the vase. This room is very comfortable to be in, but beware\nthe two owners like to be alone every now and then.\n","All of a sudden you feel like you have left the climate that you were in\nand entered the tropics. As you look up you notice cathedral ceiling with\nmany skylights. You hear the sound of running water coming from somewhere.\nAs you step up onto a platform, you notice a huge hot tub. The water is\nrunning and looks very peculiar. There are many exotic plants in here.\nHanging on the wall to your left are many green towels. To the rear of the\nof the room is a bar that is stocked with all the finest liquor that can be\nbought. It seems like Dreamer and Joyful do a lot of entertaining in here.\nCome on in, and soak for a while....the water's fine.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,})
