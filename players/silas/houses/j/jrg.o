To the west you see the shimmering \nand glittering of weapons he stole in his long legendary life. The room \neast of here is full of armours and other equipment to protect yourself \nagainst enemies. And finally to the north you see a corridor which ends \nat a door.\n","You just entered the hall of trophies. On the eastern and western walls\nyou see the heads of many famous monsters. You recognize some of them as \neasy preys, but nevertheless you are very glad to know, that they cannot\nharm you anymore. Under each of these heads is a little sign, which tells\nthe name of the monster and the date when Jrg had the pleasure to kill it\nthe first time. Some of these names sound familar to you, but others you \nnever heard of.\n","You are inside Jrg's chamber of weaponry. You wonder where he got all this\nstuff. The weapons are stored in display boxes or hang on the walls. You \nsee swords, maces, knives, lances, staffs, axes, hammers, and a lot of\nthings, that look like they weren't made by mortal hands.\n","This is the armoury, where all kind of protective devices, Jrg ever got in\nhis fingers, are stored. You see armours, cloaks, helmets, gloves, boots,\nrings, and amulets lying around in this tiny looking room. Some of these\nitems emit a strange light, which let you come to the conclusion, that they\nwere either magical or not from this world.\n","You reached the end of Jrg's trophy hall. On these walls are the heads of\nthe most fearsome monsters Jrg ever encountered. Even in death they look\nvery dangerous indeed. The signs under these heads are different from those\nyou saw in the rest of the hallway. These signs are made of marble with the\nletters of pure gold. Jrg must have been very proud, that he spend so much\nmoney on simple signs.\n","You reached to northern end of the hallway. To the north you see a huge\noaken door with a big sign on it.\n","This is Jrg's bureau, where he keeps track of his treasures and activities\nfor his guild. In the middle of the room stands a big wooden desk with\nhuge piles of paper on it. They are either new missions or letters from\nhappy customers, who appreciate Jrg's good work.\nTo the east you see some shimmering portals, the north room must be Jrg's\nbedroom, and to the west you notice mountains of treasures.\n","Here are so much gold coins, that you think Jrg's must be the richest man\nin the entire world. He likes to count them, when he finds the time to do,\nbut these days are hard, even for such a great thief like he is, and he\nhas one costumer after the other, so he keeps throwing in the coins in this\nroom, without having the pleasure to count all of them, as he did when he\nwas an unknown but nevertheless successful Novice thief.\n","Many shimmering portals are gathered in this room and they all invite you to\nenter them, but where do they lead?\n","This is the mighty thief Jrg's private bedroom, where he like to take a nap\nafter he had done some important work for his customers.\n",})
