rooms_desc ({"You find yourself on a cobblestone pathway with a wooden archway system overhead.  Various Plants grow alongside this path, and a peculiar vine hangs overhead.\nNorth of you stands the main house and east of you are the guest quarters.\nWest of here you can see the cliffs and beyond that the sea.\nAn interesting note: this yard is enclosed in glass, so the elements do not disturd the plants.  Essentially this area is a greenhouse.\n","You enter a room which initially seems darkened by all the wooden objects in the room.  This is not helped by the thick curtains coverind the large bay windows.\nThere is a large 18th century fireplace with a lit fire, and a loveseat built for two which sits in front of the firsplace.\nThere is a large coffee table sitting next to the loveseat, as well as a shelf, and a cabinet in the far corner of the room.  There are pictures all over the room.\nthere is one picture sitting on the coffee table.\n","this room contains the bare minimum for a guest and really the guest can have his/her own way with this room.  In reality it is a holodeck, and a food replicator sits in one corner.  There is a bed and a chair.  And there is a small stove in this room\nOne may store weapons and supplies here.\n","This room has a large canvas on the wall.  It is titled \"the next work of ahdom\" and it seems to be half done.  There is a paint can on the floor and several hundred eraser shavings.  Not one to litter Tsubaki has a garbage pail here.  \nThere is a dirty table to the north with piles of drawings all over it.\n","A large and spacious room with a large bed sitting right in the middle.  The walls are tastefully painted and there are numerous cabinets and wardrobes all around the room.\nA desk sits to your left, with many little gadgets sitting on it.\nA chest sits at the foot if the bed, and two chairs sit next to the desk.\nThe windows have lace curtains and a gentle breeze opens up the many folds of curtain in front of the window.\n","This room is a large full size bathroom with an extensive plumbing system.  A bath and shower are in the north end of this room and a sink and toilet are in the south west corner\nThe large shower has a shower curtain and encloses the marble bath.  One may watch the birds fly overhead by looking out the window over the bath.\nThere is a mirror over the sink, for the daily morning brush up and there is a towel rack near the door.\n","You have stepped into an architectural wonder.  Surrounding you are rare jungle plants, ranging from tall palms to leafy ferns.  Most breathtaking of all are the fragrant flowers which grow in abundance.\n In the middle of it all, a pool has been dug.  Its surface is smooth, serene and clear.\nGrowing randomly across it are lovely water lillies, and flowing into the pool from an awe-inspiring waterfall is a little stream.\nYou think that an architectural genius has been at work here.  The atmosphere of the room is one of calm and peace, and you immediately feel at ease here.\n","This is a room with a little island in the middle of the room.  There is a comprehensive setup of cabinets along the walls of the room.  The floor is all marble, and there is a overhead lighting system which is apparently hidden in the walls.\nThere are multiple large windows along the walls beneath the cabinets.\nSunlight streams in through the open windows.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","The room you enter is filled with books, lining bookcases which fill the two story room.  The windows on the eastern wall allow light to stream in and the dry air to flow in during the pleasant seasons in this area of the world.\nThe bookcases are made of solid oak, and the floor has a large carpet which is a brilliant oriental design.\n",})
