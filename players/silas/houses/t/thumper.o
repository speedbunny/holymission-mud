The serenity of this garden is added to by the\n  faint sound of water trickling by in tiny streams and occasionally\n  forming sparkling deep ponds.  The sounds of cascading water reaches\n  you from a tiny waterfall atop of which resides a small green dragon\n  basking in the sun.  A small path of gleaming white stones leads around\n  this garden as if to show you the sights, on occassion the path\n  crosses one of the tiny streams by way of a small arched bridge.  The\n  dragon shifts uneasily in his slumber and a single tear falls from\n  his eye adding to the flow from the waterfall.  A small central\n  glade is adorned with wicker chairs and a small wicker table,\n  perhaps for serving tea or entertaining guests.  You feel welcome here.\n\nThere is a sign by the waterfall.\n","This room is a special room to thumper,here she can dream \nthe dreams of magic and wonder.
