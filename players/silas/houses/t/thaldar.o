rooms_desc ({"Welcome! This is the foyer of Thaldar's house. Please feel right at home.\nThere is a chandelier hanging from the ceiling and a coat/hat rack in the\nsouthwest corner. You notice a large picture on the north wall and an old\nrug underneath your feet. Take off your coat and stay awhile!\n","You enter a long, dimly lit hallway. Two torches burn on each wall. You\nnotice a suit of armour standing along the north wall. And along the south\nwall stands a table with a notepad on it.\n","You enter into Thaldar's bedroom. Moonbeams shine through the huge plate-glass\nwindows to the north and west. The silk drapes and bed sheets glow with a\nmystical light. A large dresser sits along the east wall and to the north\nlies the bed.\n","You enter the Water Room. This is a good place to clean yourself up after a\nhard day of monster killing. In the center of the room you notice a large\npool of water. There are towels and robes hanging on the east wall and\nplants everywhere.\n","You enter the living room. This is where Thaldar relaxes after a hard day.\nOil lamps are scattered throughout the room. You see a nice sofa against the\nwest wall and two chairs to the east. In the middle of the room sits a coffee\ntable. In the south end of the room sits a foozball game and a dart board.\n","Weapons Room. If you are in here you are very fortunate. Not many people get\na chance to enter this room. The walls are covered with shields and swords.\nThe west wall is covered with various plate and chain mails. There are\nweights and a training dummy in the middle of the room.\n","Strategy Room. You cannot see the walls...it is too dark. There is a bright\nfocused light that shines down in a perfect circle around a strange looking\ntable. You notice that the table has MANY papers on it.\n","You step out onto the balcony. The soft moon light makes the thick forests\nbelow glow in a silver light. Wispy clouds string across the midnight sky\nas the creatures of the night dance in the mystical moon beams. You notice\nbeautiful roses bordering the balcony edge.\n","You are on the sun deck. It is a large natual wooden deck. You notice a few\nlawn tables with umbrellas and also several lawn chairs. There is a barbeque\nalong the east side of the deck and a full bar on the north side.\n","You are now in the kitchen. Everything looks and smells soooo wonderful. There\nare various shelves and drawers stocked with all of Thaldar's favorite foods\nand drinks. There is a dining table in the center of the room with place\nsettings for four. A beautiful chandelier hangs from the ceiling and something\nis cooking on the stove along the east wall.\n",})
