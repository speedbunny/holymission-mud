If for any reason you would like to venture round this cavern, please ask permission first.\n","The pub is small but packed full of dwarves. Troll slayers are at a table in the corner (avoid, a fight may occur at any time). Anrox the norse dwarf, friend of Thrud, can get u a beer or even a WHISKEY! Enjoy the beer and get pissed.\n","This is Thrud's weapons/armour room, you may if you have approval leave your\nweapons/armour here and Thrud or Gratnir his Runesmith will resharpen or\ncreate you a better one. From behind the north door loud hammerings can be\nheard. All around this room there are racks of swords, spears, hammers, axes,\nsome of which are double handed. Shields and amulets litter the floor, a\nboxful of BMA's lie in the corner.\n","Numerous comfy seats are found here, pull one up and watch troll slaying on     satellite. Don't disturb the dwarves in the front row with the mohican hair     cuts or you may not feel well. Sit back and enjoy.\n","This room is a Runsmiths, a runesmith is different from an ordinary\nblacksmith. Different in that a Runesmith has the ability to add powerful\nmagical runes to his weapons. Elven/Human/Orc etc. wizards have the ability\nto use magic, dwarfs cannot. Instead dwarfs are able to use the old and\nmagical lore, passed down from runesmith to runesmith. This rune magic is\neasily as powerful as any magic used by any wizard. Gratnir is Thrud's\nrunesmith, and he has an apprentice called Dimplar. If you search long enough\nyou may find a secret door hidden at the back of the room, it is locked.\nMaybe Thrud has a key.\n","This is the main General HQ of the ULSTER VOLUNTEER FORCE (UVF), who are a\nsplinter group of the ULSTER DEFENCE ARMY (UDA). There primary and only\nobjective is to wipe out the IRA and all related fenian terrorist\norganizations, so that N.Ireland can be at peace and remain within the\nUnited Kingdom (UK). The room is spatious with lots of maps everywhere.\nn a corner there are numerous weapons, and balaclavas. The RUC contact is \ncoordinating an attack on known IRA terrorists. Out the window there is an\narmy pig standing by. You get frisked as you enter, no weapons please in\nhere, and are a fenian?\n","There is a king size dwarf bed, by the northern wall. It has not been slept\nin for the last week, due to the pub not closing at all. There is a razor\nclogged up with hair lying on the chest of drawers. You conclude that Thrud\nhas been trimming his beard. Why don't you compliment him on how good it\nlooks. You hear all kinds of groans, and the squeaking of springs, with words\nlike `YES, YES , YES.' or `I WANT IT NOW BIG BOY' coming from the western door.\n","This room is bigger than the bedroom, the walls are covered from floor to \nceiling (and that too) with mirrors. In the middle of the room there is a \nshallow pool (3ft at this end, 6ft at the other- dwarfs are not reknowned for \nswimming). BUT the one thing that captures your eyes are the amount of females\nhere (approx. 15-even Thrud doesn't know). All of these females are beautiful\nand are wearing not a heck of a lot. Your mind has a brain wave (and that\ndoesn't happen a lot, does it?), this is a HAREM! Thrud allows you to \nget friendly with the girls, there are plenty of beds and condoms for\neverybody. The female dwarf brunette is Thrud's personal girl (so leave her \nalone, she has a suhi knife!)\n","Thrud has to study for his degree, so he thought if he built a geography\nroom in the mud, he might get some work done (no logic to this, but...).\nMaps of Paphos and other exotic places visited by Thrud on his travels such \nas Dunfanaghy. If you look round you will not see a radiator in sight (for\nobvious reasons, ask Thrud).\n","The cavern is BIG, and there is a wide round pit in the middle, with tiers\nupon tiers of rows of seats. The place is jam packed with more dwarfs, who\nhave come to watch the brave, the pissed, the unlucky and the stupid fight to\nthe death. There are bookies all around the pit at the front, who will take\nany bet you wish to place. NO I.O.U.'s will be taken. To get in it costs 5coins.\nEverytype of fighting occurs here, do you want to fight? You can here\nAltern-8 playing in the background, isn't it good. Enjoy.\n",})
