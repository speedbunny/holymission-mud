A small\ntable sits in the centre of the room, small pillows on each side \nof the table.\n","You have walked out of the house into the most beautiful and serene\ngarden setting you have ever seen.  The garden is designed alon the\nstrong lines of a warrior, but will all the grace and power of an artist.\nSimple Ponds intersperse the plants.
