Two really dumb cats are walking around attacking\neach other. The clock on the wall sings to you on the hour, please\nfeel free to get drunk and destroy it. A rather large dartboard \nhangs on a wall opposite the gun rack. If you hear a knocking on\nthe door, open it and shoot. It's just the neighbors.\n","Well well well. It seems that Tas is somewhat good at pool.\nPerhaps you think this because of the large pool table in the\ncenter of the room, the collection of cue sticks hanging on the\nwall, and the large fishtank with a shark swimming around in it.\nIt is here that those who wish for a good challenge come. Be warned\nthough...the shark does look a little bit hungry.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","As you enter the room you are overwhelmed by the huge collection of swords and other weapons.\nThere is also a collection of armor hanging on the wall. It's seems the armor has seen better days.\n]In the corner of the room you see a display case of little small wepons.\nThere are some pictures hanging on the north wall. \nIn the middle of the room you see a comfortable chair with a footrest. The chair is facing a tattered dartboard. The only problem with this dartborad is there are no darts in it.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
