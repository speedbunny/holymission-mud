The gate in the fence is a typical gate that you woul\n d find on a cattle ranch, and above it is the sign that tells the ranches name\n 4 pictures are on the uprights supporting the sign. Willie Nelson, Waylon Jenn\nngs, Hank Williams Jr, and David Allan Coe.\n","You pass through the main gate of Taziel's ranch and are standing in a wide open lawn area. Ahead and to the west is the main house. Off\nto the east slightly is a corral where he runs his horses. His grey quarterhorse Pepper is out there grazing. If you continue north along\nthe lane, you'll reach a copse of trees with a nice stream flowing through it. It's his favorite spot to camp and fish because of the\nnumber of pools there.\n","This room is very bright since the outer walls are clear glass. Many beautiful tropical plants fill this room with wonderful splashes of\ncolour and scent. There are benches and grassy spots to sit and enjoy the room. It is mammoth in size and you can not see any of the other\nsides. A pond in the middle holds beautiful yet deadly lionfish and the entire room makes you gasp at it's splendour.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
