There is also a welcome mat in the doorway.\nTo the north you can continue on into the entrance hall.\n","This is the entrance hall, guests are greeted after they accept the \ninvitation to enter Talos' home.  Various servants are here to attend to \nanyone's needs.  To the east is the living area of the grand home and to\nthe west, a person may enter the dining area.  Further to the north\nis a grand ballroom, where many lavish events have been held.\nYou have a feeling that this is more of a small castle than a home.\n","You have entered into the Grand Ballroom.  The walls shimmer with\ngold and silver. An immense chandelier is held high above the\nchamber illuminating the entire area.  You can tell that many great\nfunctions have been held in this room.  Maybe there will even be one \ntonight?  A large set of stairs curve up along the walls to the second\nfloor, where the living quarters of Talos may be found.\n","You have now entered the living area.  A warm glow is emanating from the\nhearth in the east wall.  There are several chairs and rockers within\nthe room in order to kick back and relax, after long days of \nadventuring.  A small bar occupies the northern side of the room\nand the southern portion is being used for various gaming tables.\nYou feel very relaxed, and are able to rest at ease in this room.\nTo the west you may head back to the entrance hall.\n","You have entered the dining area.  Amazingly, it seems that all the \nplaces have already been set for you and are awaiting you to feast.\nYour mouth begins to water as you see the wide selection of foods\nthat are strewn across the table.  Perhaps you should take a seat?\n","This is the final room in Talos' abode...the bedroom. As you can plainly\nsee...it has had very little use, i wonder why?=)\n",0,0,0,0,})
