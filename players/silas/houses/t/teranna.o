The entrance way\nis naturally luminated by a skylight you see above you.  A\ngerman shepard puppy is wagging his tail at your feet.\n","Four posters stare down at you as you enter the living room.\nYou kick off your shoes and relax on the couch.  Looking around, you\nsee a tv, vcr, and stereo system.  A bookshelf next to the \nentertainment center stands full of various titles.  You knock\nan empty carton onto the floor as you thumb through issues of\nthe latest magazines.  You notice a large picture hanging above \nthe mantle of a roaring fireplace.\n","A small cat climbs up your back, clawing into you as you\nenter the kitchen.  In the corner is a brand-new refridgerator\nwith an expresso machine sitting on the corner next to it.\nFour chairs surround the table in the center of the room.  Many cabinets\nline the walls.  You smell cooking in the air and see something on the stove.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,})
