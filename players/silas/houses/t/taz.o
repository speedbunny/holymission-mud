rooms_desc ({"This is Taz's main room of his house.  The floor stretches as far as the\neye can see.  The room is decorated in a gothic style mainly in the color\nblack.  Large omnious black pillars hold up the ceiling, which seems to be \none large mirror.  To the northwest there is a pool, crowded with beautiful\nwomen.  The blonde is naked, the brunette is wearing a bathing suit of fish-net\nand the black haired sex-kitten is lying on the floor completelynaked.\nNearby the pool is a bed.  In the opposite corner of the room, guys crowd\naround video games, seemingly oblivious to the fact of the beautiful \nnymphomaniac harem which is just a short walk away.  This room is also Taz's\nmakeshift bedroom, you look to the south and see a beatuiful black lace curtain\nblocking the view of what seems to be a beatiful girl lying on a bed.  Taz\nwould be very angry to find out you were looking at his sex-kitten. So you \ndecide not to stare anymore.\n","This is Taz's pool hall, You look around the dimly lit room and see about \nfour pool tables.  There are some girls at one of the tables, and people\ncrowded around a small bar.  Behind the bar there is a large sign.... Maybe\nyou should look at it.. :-)  Behind the bar is a beautiful barmaid, Taz only\nhires women to work for him for some strange reason !?!?!  People sit at \nsmall tables and drink away their troubles, gossip fills the air almost as\nmuch as smoke does... In the midst of the tables, there is a slightly \nraised platform on which Wynonna Rider is performing a strip tease for \nTaz and his friends... Other than this, it's a pretty dull room.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
