Through\nthe skylight you see the full moon shining down to the vast expanses of the \nfloor.  A calm comes over you as you realize you are safe in the presence of\nLung.  All is well.\n","\tA large room sits here with all of Lung's creature comforts.  A large\ncolor television rests on a shelf in one of the upper corners of the room.  A\nsmall refrigerator lies on the floor next to the couch.  You believe it is \nmost likely full of beer.   There is a lot of commotion to the south, you think\nit must be the gaming room that he has been bragging about.  Back to the west\nlies the conference room and the exit to the church. \n","\tYou have entered the gaming room of Monk Lung and you must want to play\none of the games.  Your choices include darts, pool, phooseball, and beer\npong.  You have never felt more at home than you do here.  You realize this\nbecause Lung is an extravagant host.

Other than\nthe bed, dresser, and mirror all the other gadgets and objects seem strange.\nYou wonder what there use is, and giggle with your own imagination as new and\nexotic ideas spring to mind.
