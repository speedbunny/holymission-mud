No sounds at all.  No wind blows, no\nbirds sing.  The stillness is complete.  No tree branches sway, no\nleaves flutter.  You know something is seriously wrong when you realize\nthat where you just stepped, the deep green grass shattered.\n\n","This is a very peaceful place.  Soft blue light falls from the high ceiling\nwhich is also mostly a watery blue, but has some soft white streaks\nswirling accross it.  The walls are draped in flowing fabric in slightly\nvarying shades of blue.  It ripples silently as the air moves about the\nroom.  A thick, comfortable white carpet covers the floor completely, and\nlots of blue cushions are in piles around the room.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
