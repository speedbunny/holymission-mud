As you look out towards\nthe horizon you notice a beautiful sunset...the clouds of every colour streach\nacross the sky as dusk settles in.  Over head you can hear the calls of \nthe seaguils. You feel totally at ease here, it is a very relaxed \natmosphere. You feel as if nothing in the world could harm you here as the \nsweet ocean breeze blows across your face.\n","This is the entry room to Lynnes house. It is large and lavish\nwith stone walls, and a polished teak floor. Two large persian\nrugs flank a bay window to the south. Large archways lead west\nand north. The mahogony front door is east.\n"," As you enter the room you are caught in a small shower, a gentle breeze is\n blown ruffling your hair. As you continue to walk into the room, you notice \nthat the walls are made of the most lusious chocolate. You take note that \nthere is is a beautiful ray of sunlight streaming through the hole in the \nwall which is in the shape of an Easter Egg, where Baer has been eating\nat the wall. The floor is lined in a huge baer-skinned rug. You are surprised\n to see such a beautiful river flowing, peacefully though the middle of the room\n...as you look towards the center of the river you notice Baer's bed floating\nin the river, where only he can get to it. As you look to the northeastern\ncornor of the room you notice and cute, cuddly penguin there, bouncing around\nlooking to be hugged. You notice shining coming from the floor, as you look \nclosely you notice that they are pieces of colourful foil. Reds, greens,\nblues, silvers, and golds sparkle in the room. As you look up, trying to note\nthe ceiling, you come to the conclusion to give up because there doesnt \nseem to be one. But watchout for the banana pleel on the floor as you look \naround this wonderful room.\n","This is the lounge room of Lynnes house. It is large and comfortable\nwith a warming marble fireplace in the middle of the east wall\nIn the southeast is a pianola, and the northeast is a large old\ndesk. On the north wall is a large leather lounge, and the west wall \nhas a set of book cabinets.\nTo the south is a large double door leading to the bedroom, and an exit\nin between the bookcases leads west.\n","As you walk into the room you take notice of the huge bear-skinned rug \nsurrounding the bed. The four poster bed is facing north with the headboard\nagainst the south wall. There is a long window above the headboard, letting \nthe sun shine through during the day. To the west you notice a grand butlers\ncabinet. To the northeast is a huge fireplace, providing the only heat and \noccasionally the only light. To the east wall, south of the door, is an old\ntapestry above the drysink. On each sides of the bed you notice lavish endtables\n. To the east there is a spa.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
