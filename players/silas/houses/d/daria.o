rooms_desc ({"You are in the hallway of summoner Daria's house. There is a small sign hanging on the north wall. East there is a wooden door with a plague on it saying \"The storage\". You can imagine that there are some pretty valuable stuff in there. The only light comes from a paperlanthron hanging down from the roof. If you look closely you can see a small entrance to the west leading to a dimly lit place.\n","You have entered the treasury of summoner Daria. As you look around you see numerous bonzai-trees in ancient pots. The walls are decorated with a few paintings, but mostly with zen-buddhistic calligraphy in golden frames. There is a particular frame that covers all the northern wall that attracts your attention.\n","The prison is a very dull place. You suspect that you will die soon out of boredom, if not by starvation.\n","You realize that you have entered corridor that leads to the quarters of summoner Daria. You notice that there are a lot of shoes on a wooden shoe rack here.\nThere are doors leading north and south. The corridor continues west.\n","You are in the sleeping quarters of summoner Daria. You see a large mattress lying on the floor. There is a small table by the mattress.\n","You can tell by the scent of oriental spices that you have entered the dining room. There is a large table here but no chairs. Chairs would not have been a good idea anyway considering the hight of the table.\n","You are in front of a small door. You can faintly smell inceses behind the door.\n","You feel a peace of mind and a universal harmony flow through your body. You realize that you have entered the tea-room. You see an altar before you. There are some books beside the altar. To your left you notice an asymmetrical bow with a few arrows. \n",0,0,})
