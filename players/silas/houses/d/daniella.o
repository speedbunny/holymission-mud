She is graciously waiting to look after your needs, as a perfect hostess.\nThe parquet floor is onyx and ebony, with a beautiful matching rug on which to leave your shoes.\nThe walls are hung with gold ornaments and have a soft golden hue to them. A\nsmall cherry-wood stand is here, with a mirror and a place to leave packages.\nLeave your coat on the brass stand and feel free to look about. Oh, but \nbeware of the cats-they guard the house......\n","This room is the atrium,  The walls are a creamy yellow, with a border of bright yellow flowers.\nThe air smells faintly of flowers, as there are pots everywhere.\nThe vivid orchids, violets, and lilies make a wonderful contrast with the rest of the room.\nThe wicker furniture has yellow flowered cushions that look so comfortable you just have to sit down and relax.\nThree playful little kittens are frolicking in the afternoon sunshine.\nThe slatted window blinds can be drawn back, and a spectacular view of the garden can be seen.\nStep out onto the terrace, if you wish.\n","The huge queen size bed dominates the middle of the room, with a carved swan head- and foot-board.\nAt either side of the bed are night tables with small reading lamps.\nThe east wall is taken up by a large window, so the morning sun can come in.\nA large bureau holds all of the various toys Dani likes to collect....\nNotice if you will the white cat lounging on the bed...she is purring and lazily stretching.\n","The master bath is done in an opulent black and gold scheme.\nA large black whirlpool bath with gold dolphin taps is on the far side.\nThe pedastal sink also has gold taps, in the the recurring dolphin theme.\nA separate shower is in the other corner, with a window looking out over the garden.\nThe floor is done in black mosaic tiles, with small gold accent rugs to brighten it and add drama.\nA royal blue silk robe is hanging on the back of the door, it smells of Jessica McClintock, Dani's favorite perfume.\n","The terrace of Daniella's humble abode is ready for a garden party.\nA glass topped table is set for six, and the bright yellow umbrella shades your eyes from the sun.\nLarge fruit trees and palms are along the edges of the garden, creating a natural fence.\nIt even look like there may be ripe pears on them!!\nAbundant rose bushes in every possible shade scent the air, and a trellis is filled with bright blue Morning Glories.\nA large open area is perfect for children and pets to run and play in, a little house is nestled in the back corner.\nDaniella's sweet dogs, Shami and Satan are asleep in the shade, as always.\n","This sunny area contains a pool, many lounge chairs, a jacuzzi, and a sauna.\nThere are places for you to leave your towel and suit...only nude bathing here!!!\nThe steps in front of you lead into the 10 foot deep, heated swimming pool, so why not take a dip?\nThe cat in the sun looks well rested and soft to the touch...she also loves to swim, oddly enough!\n","This room is a gorgeous salon/parlor that Daniella entertains in.\nThe richly upholstered Rococco styled furniture and paintings reflect the great taste of the owner.\nLarge ferns rest on polished oak tables, and small lamps are strategically placed for soft lighting.\nWouldn't you like to touch the cool, smoky blue cat lounging on the settee?\n","Ohmigod!!!  It looks to you like you have hit a time warp!!!\nA huge disco ball revolves from the ceiling, and beaded curtains cover the doors.\nFunky-ass furniture and a few hippie friends are hangin around, it looks like they are proper flower children *PEACE!*\nOrange carpet and bright blue walls make you sorta sick, they're so tacky.  But the blaring music makes you want to BOOGIE!!!\nCome on in and smoke some weed, an acid trip awaits you!!!\n","This room is pretty empty, except for the enormous couch and big screen t.v..\nThis is a place where Dani's friends can come and chill or talk if they've had a hard day.\nA pool table in the corner is always ready for play, all the sticks are there waiting!\nFeel free to leave stuff here if you need to, it'll keep til next reboot.\nHappy MUDding!!!\n","Nothing really is in this room.\nThere is a vase with a bunch of dead flowers in it and scattered cards.\nOld pictures litter the floor along with a lot of bus receipts.\nA burned up chair smolders in the corner, and the wall is scorched.\nA Siamese cat scowls at you from a blanket in the middle of the floor.\n",})
