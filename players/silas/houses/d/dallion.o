You also see Dallion's r\neveryday autos; a 1991 Lotus Espirit SE, and the new Bentley Turbo R.\n","This room is decorated in dark oak.  Shelves of books reach from floor\nto ceiling.  You wonder if Dallion has read them all.  you notice in the\ncorner a leather wing-back chair that looks broken in and comfy.\nYou also notice Dallion's cat, Beamer, sitting in the chair and you\nrealize that if you try to sit there she'll kick your ass.\n","This room is decorated in pickled pine and hunter green.  The carpet is a \ndeep shade of hunter green.  The bed is HUGE, and looks very comfortable.\nyou notice Dallion's other cat, Duchess, on the bed.  you decide that you\ndon't want to mess with her either.\n","This is the garage in which Dallion restores his autos.  In the corner\nis a chassis for a Type 904 porsche.  On the rack is a restored \nPorsche 550 Spyder waiting for a new transmission.  In the corner of the \nshop is Dallion's McLaren F1 that he uses for the fun of out-running\nthe police on saturday nights.\n","You enter a room with white walls and floor.  In the corner you see the latest model Cray computer.  In the center of the room is a table with sttel legs and a glass top.  On the table you see a phone a black split keyboard, a mouse, and a joystick.  In the ceiling you see mounted an SVGA projection monitor that is pointed at the wall that the desk faces. you figure that it must cast an image at least seventy inches (177.8 cm) wide.  In the walls on either side of the desk are mounted HUGE speakers.  you realize that they must be hooked up to the CRAY in the corner.  you feel that Dallion's soul is in this room and you start to understand that his life is empty except when the computer is on.\n","This is the room where Dallion displays the art he has bought.\nThe artists are not necessarily, and may never be, famous.\nThe art is not necessarily expensive.  This is art that Dallion likes;\nnot some jerk from New York, LA, or San Francisco.  Dallion Doesn't care\nwhat is stylish, and you notice this.  You also notice that while Dallion\nis always increasing his collection it is ALWAYS tasteful.\n","This is the depression room.  It is empty except for a single chair in \nthe center of the room.  The room is lit by a single light-bulb\nsuspended from the ceiling.  The walls, floor, and ceiling are painted\nin dark swirls that show madness and pain.  This is where Dallion \ncomes to think when he is disappointed in his life.  This is where Dallion has \nbeen spending much of his time.\n",0,0,})
