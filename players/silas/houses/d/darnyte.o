You hear\nthe sound of a T.V. to the west. You see a BIG sign on the east wall!\nPerhaps you should look at it?\n","As you enter the room you can almost see the magic in this room. Hanging from\nthe ceiling is a strange blue globe of light. On the west wall is a big\nworktable. There seem to be several experiments in progress. To the south\nis a normal door leading back into the house. Guarding the door is a giant.\nThere is a small imp adjusting some of the tubes and dials on the worktable.\n","In here you see a big screen T.V. and a very expensive stereo system.\nThe stereo and T.V. are so loud you can't even hear your self think.\nYou notice a bar located on the west wall. and you see that Darnyte has\nmarked the north wall with the outline of a door. You wonder what will go\nthere.\n","This is Darnyte's transport nexus, it has exits leading to the shop, the\nchurch, the main guild in town, and of course back into the house..:)\nYou can feel the room throb with power, and feel awe knowing what great\nmagiks have been wroght here to produce this room.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
