rooms_desc ({"You are standing at the end of a stone path. Up ahead it winds \nthrough a a grove of tall dark oak trees scattering shade and sunlight\nacross the path. On either side thick lush grass grows around\nthe roots of the trees. You can here the wind whisper through the \nleaves of the trees overhead, giving you a feeling of peace and relaxation.\nAt the end of the path is a large stone house of Victorian design. \n","You are standing in Denebs living room. This room is decorated with beautiful\nantique furniture from the Victorian era. The couch, chairs, and table are \ncarved from solid oak and polished to a dark shine. They are covered with a\nblue velvet and embroidered with scenes of spring, birds, trees, and flowers.\nThe rug is a soft plush white. Lush green potted plants adorn the tables and corners of the room. \nTo the west a sliding door opens onto a patio, where you can watch the sun set\non hot summer nights. The door is open and light green silk curtains \naround it waft in a cool spring breeze. You can smell an exotic mixture of \nfragrances drifting in from the garden. \n","You are standing on a sanded wood patio. Sun chairs lie facing west, and \na picknick table rests in the center. To the south, wooden steps lead down \ninto aan enchanting garden. A light spring breeze carries the fragrance \nof flowers up to the deck. Past the garden you see tall trees the sun shining into their branches. You can hear the sound of water running somewhere\nbeyond sight. As you look up into the sky you can see the stars beggining\nto come out one by one as the sun sets, casting rays of fading color across the sky\nA bird wistles softly in the garden; you can hear crickets begin to chirp.\nThere are candles set in transparant stained glass cups around the porch \ncasting a soft multi-colored glow across the sanded wood of the deck. \n","You are in a Dimly lit hallway. Rooms extend off of it on either side. \nThe walls are covered with a slightly faded off white wall paper \ndecorated with pictures of tiny roses and vines. Glass lamps bathe \nthe area in a warm light from  their brass fixtures on \nthe walls. Rooms extend off of this hall way from either side. The \nhallways continutes north , the livingroom is south. \n","You are in Deneb's kitchen. A wide bay window lets in the morning light \nto the east. The kitchen contains all the nessecities of modern life, \na microwave, stove, dishwasher, plenty of pots and pans\nand the cupboards are stocked with foods from all over the world. \nDeneb's special spaggetti sauce is on a slow simmer on the front burner.\nThe room is filled with the spicy smell of oregano, garlic, mmm, \nand something delicious that you cant quite put your finger on. \nhelp yourself to all the delicious food! bon apetite!\n","You are at the end of a long hallway. \nGlass lamps light the hallway on either side. To the nother a winding staircase\nleads up into a tower. The hallway has a warm cosy feeling, but it could be \nscary at night. Rooms adjoin the hallway on eith side, the \nhallway continues ot the south. \n","You are in a stairway winding upwards through a stone tower. Candles in\nwrought iron holders flicker lighting the granite walls eerily. The \nwooden steps creak as you move. The polished wood of the staps has been\nworn down over the years. You can see light dimly from a doorway at \nthe top of the stairs, below light from the hall baths the entrance of the \nstair. \n","You are at the top of the tower. This seems to be the bedroom. \nTo the east is a circular stained glass window which sends a dazzling\narray of color across the room each morning. To the west\na sliding door opens onto a balcony extending around the tower. \nThe door is open and a light brezze wafts the silk curtains carrying\nthe scent of climbing roses. The sun is setting outside casting\na warm glow across the room .The bed stands \nagainst the north wall; it is built from dark wood \nand ornately carved. The sheets and blankets and blue-green and blue\nand green curtains hang from the canopy. The ceiling \nis covered with glow in the dark stars. On the desk are some \nbooks about electrical engineering and plasma physics as well \nas a copy of The Fountainhead and a complete set of the \ncollected works of Robert A. Heinlein. On the south wall is a dazzling \nmural depicting a future of civilization in space. The music of \nMozarts \"Requiem\" is playing on the stereo. \n","You have entered what appears to be a private... or perhaps not so \nprivate place. The windows are shaded and the room is lit by the warm \nglow of candles and the soft glow of a blue light. The floor is carpeted wit\na thick soft carpet. At one end is a large brass bed. It looks recently \nslept in ... or something. You notice a piece of rope loosely tied around \nof the bedposts. A flicker of light catches you eye drawing your attention\nto the mirrored ceiling. On the walls are a number of erotic charcoal\ndrawings. \nYou feel embarrassed that you have walked into someones private room,\nyet are somewhat aroused. \n","The stairs lead down into a vast garden. Peace descends on your soul.\nYou feel you could spend the rest of your life here in perfect \ncontentment. You take off your shoes and walk barefoot on the grass. \nStone pathways run randomly between groves of flowering trees, pines, \nand shady elms. To the north is a large field of wildflowers with random dirt paths winding through\nit. A brook runs west into a small wood. In its center is a small clearing\nWith a firepit and logs for friends to gather their and camp beneath \nthe stars. It is a cool spring evening the sun sets to the west behind\nthe tops of the trees. The brook collects in a small pool beneath a\ntumbling rapids. The water is clear and inviting, the stones on the bottom\nsmoothed. The wind wispers through the branches of the trees sending\nflower petals tumbling through the air to land floating on the surface of the water. \nAbove you a few stars are just beggining to come out. \n",})
