The walls are\ncovered in wooden panels and lend a dreamy quality to the place\n","You have entered the main living area, soft music is playing in the background\nand a large television takes up the north-western corner of the room.\nA well stocked bar takes up the entire eastern wall, and a door south \nleads to the bedroom.\n","In the center of the room is a large four-poster bed, and around it lie several\npotted plants. A door leads east onto a balcony and a large bay window lets\nin the moonlight. An open fire fills the room with warmth and a rug lies\nbefore it, to the side of the fireplace is a coal scuttle.\n","You enter the balcony outside of the bedroom, you first notice the\nmoor spreading out before you, tall granite mountains leading down into\na deep loch. You can feel the wind blowing through the air and the moon lends\neverything a strange poetic feel to the land.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,})
