The passage leads into the\nmain area of the hole.\n","A nice cosy fire burns in the fireplace, with many chairs drawn up close to it.\nThe shelves along the walls are lined with books, many of which look quite \nold.  A glowworm hangs from the ceiling to augment the light brought in by\nthe single window.  You find it quite a cheery place indeed.\n","It's a cosy place indeed, the bed strewn with thick quilts and fluffy \npillows.  Sunlight fills the room, coming from large window looking out over\nthe garden. \n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","Butterflies and birds fly through the air, drawn by the fragrance of the\nmultitudes of blooming flowers.  The flowers are in every imaginable colour, \nand arranged in neat beds and rows.  Cobbled stone paths lead to the \nvarious areas of the garden\n",0,0,0,0,0,})
