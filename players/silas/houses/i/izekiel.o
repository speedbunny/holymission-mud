Izekiel probably left his stove on again...\nThere is a couch that you know you want to sit on, a TV across from the\ncouch, and a dusty shelf with a Bible on it.\n","\n\nThis is Izekiel's Master Bedroom.\nYou notice that the double, king size bed is covered in velvet sheets,\nand that the room is covered in the same material.  Can you\ntell that Izekiel loves velvet?  It just feels so awesome,\ndon't you agree?\n\n","\n\n\nThis is Izekiel's bathroom, where you see the one and only \"heart-shaped\"\nbathtub, the only one of it's kind in HM.  Rumors have spread far and\nwide about this bathroom, for it is said that kings have been conceived\nin it.  Well, maybe not kings, as a matter of fact, not anybody!\nThat's why it's a rumor.  If Izzy keeps building rooms like these,\nhe's never gonna pay off his mortgage...\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
