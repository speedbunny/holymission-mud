Along the cieling \nyou see long icy stlagtites,which drip into icy pools in the\nfloor.  The room sparkles when the light hits it just right.\nYou feel very relaxed here.  In the center of the room is a \nsnow white couch. With a white bear skin rug in front of it.\n","       In this room you see a huge crystal sitting \nhigh atop an ice tower.  When you gaze at the crystal\nyou feel you are in touch with your inner self. There are \nno secrets here. Stay or leave, but be warned,the real you\nmight not be what you want to see.\n","This room is for Icelady's special someone. Here someone can sit,\nrest,read a book,or just relax.  There is a double bay window\noverlooking many miles of hills and lush green mountains.  \nThere is a king sized easy chair here to relax in \nand a cooler full of tall cold ones for him.\nSo enjoy my friend as you are always welcome here.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.
