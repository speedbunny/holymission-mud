There are trees with birds singing in them and you can feel a gentle breeze stirring in your hair. There is the smell of flowers lightly perfuming the air and you welcome the sunshine on your face. This is the garden where Iola and Tegerl come to laugh and to cry. Usually, however, they have happy times here. You are welcome to stay or to have a look around at the splendid beauty.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
