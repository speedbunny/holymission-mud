There is\nwhite sand as far as you can see in every direction, and the\nsun overhead is beating down mercilessly, making you feel the \nneed to consume vast quantities of alcohol. In the distance to\nthe north you can just distinguish the outline of Blark's\nhouse. A small black hole in the air behind you will take\nyou to the church, the guild or the shop. There are some blue\naardvarks fluttering happily around in the sky above. A\nsolitary dead aardvark lies nosedived in the sand nearby.\n","You are standing in the front garden of Blark's lovely house,\nwhich lies to your north. The house seems to defy gravity - \nbuttresses, towers and balconies jut out at strange angles and\nit is much taller than you would think possible. Around you in\nthe garden are many brightly coloured plants and trees, and the\nlawn is lush and verdant despite the searing heat. In the centre\nof the lawn is a large, spectacular fountain which bubbles with\nsparkling water. Many small furry creatures frolic happily around\nthe garden, whilst large scary ones lurk in the shadows of the\ntrees. Behind a distant hedge to the east you can see a large\nastroturf football pitch.\n","You have entered the main room of the newly\nmatured Blark's house. He has removed all the\nsilly pictures and football trophied and tidied\nup considerably. Remarkably, at such short notice,\nhe has lined the walls with huge bookcases stuffed\nwith scholarly volumes. In fact, Blark is so mature now\nthat he's not even going to complete this description.\n\nSo there.\n\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
