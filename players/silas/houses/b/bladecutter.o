And let me know if you have any opinions, questions,\nor comments on my room descriptions\n\nIan.\n","You have entered a not-so-cramped kitchen, filled with wonderful devices\nthat make using it that much easier. There's the Magic Microwave, which\nhas a special talent of holding anything you want in it. There's the \nlarge, white stove, which is both gas and electric (don't ask).  There's \nthe huge sink, which holds most of his dishes, while the dishwasher\nholds the rest. A table sits in the middle of the room, with 4 chairs \nsurrounding it. And a really large fridge.\n","In here you see a massive room, filled with stuff including a 40 inch tv\na long ebony table, Super Nintendo, Sega Genisis, an IBM. A Pool Table ]\ntakes up one side of the room, while the pool takes up the other.\nA large couch just made for necking is here.\n"," Now you know where Blade hides from everyone when he isn't in the mood\nfor people contact.  The collection of cars is amazing.  And all are \nready to be taken out on the track!  The Garage is filled with tools, t\nthat are scattered in various tool boxes every where you look.  The one\ncar that really catches your eye is the sleek, Metallic Midnight Blue\n81 Grand Prix in the corner of the shop.  Lowered just enough, and with\na set of vulcanized meats that seem like the perfect size, you desire a \nride in this beast first.  Then your eyes start wandering across the\nother cars... Porche, Corvette, Camaro, Lotus, Ferarri, Firebird, and\neven a Cougar are all here, for you to look at.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","This Living Room is about the same size as the Reck room, but is a bit more\nrelaxing. You see a large fireplace on the north wall, and a huge couch on \nthe east, which looks comfortable. You wonder what it's used for. You also\nwonder how he keeps a white carpet so spotless. A stereo system adorns the \nwest wall, lending a romantic mood on occasions.\n","You have walked out of the house, onto an elevated deck, and are blasted\nwith a warm sea breeze that feels nice to the touch.  As you breath in \nthe sweet air, you relax as the sounds of the calm sea lap up against the\nshore. The sun hangs low over the distant western sky, indicating that the \nday is coming to an end.  You wish that you were with your loved one right\nnow, for a quick kiss in the romantic half-light.  As you look around, \nyou see the sand reflecting the blazing sun, making the shore look as if \nit's on fire.  You can't wait until the sun is gone, so that you can go\nfor a nice moonlight walk on the beach.  Your heart throbs as you think\nof a long passionate kiss with your special someone.  You notice seagulls\nsoaring in the distant sky, searching the water for a snack.  On the \nshore, you notice various shapes of seashells, half buried in the sand.\n","You have entered Bladecutter's master bedroom, and are amazed at everything\nthat he's crammed in here.\nFirst there is the queen size bed, and the sheets look like they were just put on. Then you notice the night tables on each side of the bed.\nLooking around, you see the two oak dressers, one with a jewelry box.\nTo the north is the bathroom, and sooner or later,\nI'll get around to decorating this room better...\nUnfortunately, I'm not the same person I was 2 years ago when I coded the \nrest of this house. I wish I was, but things have happened, and I can't\nsee the beauty of things that I saw 2 years ago.\n",0,0,})
