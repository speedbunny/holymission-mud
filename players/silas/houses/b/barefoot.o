The room is quite\nsmall and there are not many things in here. - A small table, two chairs,\nbut you are certainly impressed by the inviting comfortable couch which\nstands right in front of a fireplace.  The room is illuminated by the\nflickering light of the roaring fire, and by your presence of course!!\nOn the wall right above the fireplace is a strange but interesting painting.\nWhat a cosy room....\n","This is the bedroom of Hakan and Barefoot.\nThe walls are painted in a warm light-brown color.  You are surrounded by\nbeautiful flowers and different kinds of other green plants.  The smell of\ncherries reaches your nose, but you can't see its origin.  There is not\nmuch room for furniture because of all the plants everywhere.  However, the\nmost important thing in this room seems to be an inviting huge bed which is\ncertainly big enough for four people.  Actually it looks more like a\nplayground covered with blankets and dozens of soft blue pillows.  Next to\nthe bed you notice a little bar, but you wonder why there are only some\nbottles of cherry brandy inside.  You also wonder why the ice cubes don't\nmelt away in the breeze of warm sweet-smelling air.\n","What are you doing here?  This is Barefoot's private room, nobody\nis really allowed to enter it.  Bare comes here to sit down on the\ncouch, and to hug his big brown teddybear which is a gift from a\nvery special friend.  This is a room where he can be alone, where\nnobody can see the tears in his eyes when he is depressed and sad.\nEven though Barefoot doesn't want to be in this room, he is often\nhere just to think about live, love and the future...\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
