rooms_desc ({"    You have just enntered the front porch of Broken's quaint cottage in the\nmountains of Vermont.  You see nothing but trees surrounding the house, and\nyou can't hear anything other than the sounds of woodland creatures doing\ncute little animal-like things all around you.  Hell, the neighbor's dog\nis doing it right now with your female rotweiller as you read this.  Anyway...\nThe north door leads into the kitchen, wereas the east door leads into the living room.\n","   You have entered the spacious kitchen in Broken's country cottage.\nOn the stove, you see a couple pots boiling what will probably wind up being\ntonights dinner. You try to resist the urge to taste the spagetti sauce\nthat's boiling, and eventually cave in and take a quick bite of some of the\ngarlic bread that just came out of the oven about two minutes ago.\nTo the east is the dining room, and to the north is a hallway.\n","   You have enter Broken's living room, and you notice all the nice comfortable\nchairs and sofas just waiting for you to sit and relax in.  On the 52 inch\nbig screen television, you see the Rangers beating the crap out of the poor\nunfortunate team that faces them tonight. The current score is 21-2, and\nNemchinov with 7 goals and 12 assists so far in the game...\nand its still only the first period.\nTo the north is the dining room, and to the east is the bathroom.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,})
