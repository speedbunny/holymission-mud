You are impressed and the emphasis of the design is obviously `comfort in style'.\nYou notice the doorways are higher than usual, you get the impression the owner may be rather tall.\n","On the far wall there is a large golden framed mirror, beautiful craftsmanship.\nThe mirror seem intrigueing, you take a closer look to discover what looks like a safe, is it locked you wonder.\nThere are 3 small tables in the room. On each of them is a fragile china vase. the key to the safe is in one of them.\nIn one corner of the room is a large four-poster bed with luxurious bedding.\nThere is a large window on one wall which overlooks  a big apple orchard.\nThere are two doors also in the room.One is the one\nwe came in and the other leads to a passageway  which seems to lead to a storage closet.The walls are covered withportraits.There is only one recognizable one--it is Eponine!!Does she have something to do with this room? The expression on the face in the portrait is one of puzzlement.\nThe only light source in the room are candles in ornate brass candlesticks, so keep the door shut or they may go out!!\nAround the room there are an abundance of large sort pillows to throw around the place, you are most definately tempted!\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
