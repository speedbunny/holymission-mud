This is Buggerlugs' humble abode, situated high in the \nhills, quite a way from civilization.\nYou pick yourself up and look around you.  You are standing in the hall,\na hat and coat stand on your right, and a long polished table on your\nleft.  Far at the end of the hall you see a heavy pine door.  As you\nlook around you, you spot an array of pictures on the walls.  \n","You walk into the kitchen and a tempting cooking smell hits you right\nin the nose!  This kitchen is warm and spacious, and shock, horror, it's\nclean too!  You realise the warmth is generated by a wood-burning\nstove.  Along one wall is a french dresser.  There are many cupboards\nand shelves, you can't resist taking a peek!  There is a plant on the\nwindowsill.  In the centre of the room is a wooden picnic-style bench,\nwith seats.  You see pots and pans hanging from the walls.\nYou feel your mouth watering as you smell the traditional Sunday \nlunch that you can imagine gets cooked here.\n","You walk straight into the sitting room, and a warm and cosy feeling\nflows through your veins.  The deep pile, brown carpet makes you want\nto take off your shoes and bury your toes in its depth.  Heavy brown\nvelvet curtains frame the double windows.  Facing a big, comfortable\ncouch is a massive stone fireplace, a blazing log fire burning in it.\nAbove the fireplace you spot a large painting.\nAlong another wall is a heavy oak sideboard, 19th century with delicate\npatterns engraved on it.  Standing on this glorious piece of furniture\nis a wedding photo.  You also spot a hi-fi system and a television\nhidden in a cabinet, an attempt to keep this gorgeous room in olde \ntimes.\nOverall, the low ceiling, the warm fabrics, gives this room a really cosy\natmosphere, you could sit here forever!\nWoofit is here.\n","You move further along the hall, and notice more photos on the\nwalls.  There is also a large clock standing in the corner and a\nbucket sitting on a mat, just between the sitting room and study doors.\nTo the west is the backdoor, leading out to the garden.\n","You step out into the fresh air and see before you a breathtaking view.\nYour eyes sweep across the rolling hills, the forests and the green\nfields, you delight in the surrounding beauty.\nImmediately before you is a patch of grass, luscious and green, it\nlooks as though it needs cut though.  Bordering the lawn is a flowerbed,\nfilled with pansies, sweet williams, carnations and roses.  To one side\nstands a picnic table and benches, and to the other an old swing for two.\nAgainst the wall of the house stands a pile of logs, waiting to be burnt.\nYou look up to the sky to find it's a gorgeous day, and the many birds\nbring their sweet music to your ears.  Further west, this countryside\nscene continues.  You sit down and relax, waiting for Buggerlugs to\njoin you.\n","You walk into the room and instantly feel like you're being seduced.  A \nmassive bed sits against one wall, covered with bottle green sheets.\nThe deep pile carpet is a lighter shade of green, matching the curtains,\nbut the walls are again a deep green colour.  On the eastern wall you\nspot a fitted double wardrobe, and beside this stands a beautiful oak\ndressing table, cluttered with bottles and jars.  You also notice an array\nof photo frames.\nA comfortable chair sits in one corner, covered with a light green fabric,\nand a cabinet, with a telephone stands in another.\nYou notice an open doorway to the north, you wonder where it leads to!\n","This is Bugs' study, but by the look of things, not much study goes\non in here!  Sure, there is a bookcase and sure there are books, but\njust look at them!  There's also a computer here, with pieces of paper\nstrewn around it.  Her desk, though once piled high with unfiled notes\nand scraps of paper, is now a neat and tidy place of work, you get the \nfeeling that when she gets actually gets down to it, Buggerlugs can\nwork quite hard!\nThere's a stereo in the corner, beside a big pile of beanbags.  A shelf\nruns around the room, filled with teddybears, and the walls are packed\nfull of photos.  One wall, however, has a pinboard on it, with all \nthe important information needed by such a person as Buggerlugs pinned\nto it...why is it crammed so full?\nYou can tell this room is lived in quite a bit...just by the state of it!\nThe carpet is worn and in need of a hoover and you spot a plate and a \nglass from her last meal.  Hmmmm..!\n","You walk into the bathroom and are amazed by its proportions.  The\nhuge sunken bath can easily accomodate two people and there is\nalso an abundance of floorspace, covered in deep pile carpet to stretch\nout on.  Along one wall is a counter, covered in bottles and jars, backed\nby a long mirror.  There is a shower in one corner, and a toilet and basin\nbeside it.  The whole room is panelled with pine, various plants scattered\naround to complement the walls.\nBig fluffy towels hang from the rails and you see two bathrobes hanging up.\nThere is also a stereo system on a pine chest of drawers, surrounded by\ncassettes....this room looks as if it is used a lot, the warmth, the\nsweet smell of oils....hmmmmmm..you could stay here forever!\n","You walk straight into a countryside scene; rolling hills, green\nfields, lots of trees.  The sun is shining and there isn't a cloud in the\nsky...it's a beautiful day!  You are standing on a grassy meadow, covered\nin daisies and buttercups, with luscious green grass underfoot.  A small\nstream bubbles not far away, the water glistening in the sun.  In a nearby\nfield stands a sleek, dark horse.  In the trees behind you, birds are\nsinging tunefully and butterflies and bees dance from flower to flower.\nA playful breeze ruffles your hair, bringing with it the smell of pine, and\nthe sweet scent of the forest plants.\nA few yards away, lying on the ground is a chequered cloth, covered in\nplates and dishes filled with typical picnic foods, the spread makes your\nmouth water just looking at it!  There is also an icebucket holding a\nchilled bottle of wine, and two glasses await the cool liquid.  A large\ncake sits in the centre of the cloth, iced with the words:-\n                HAPPY BIRTHDAY BILL!\nA small giftwrapped box sits beside it.\n","You walk past the lawn and find yourself in a woody glade.  You are\nsurrounded by trees on three sides, with the house to your east.  The\nground is scattered with twigs and mossy grass, and the air is filled\nwith the sappy scent of trees and woodland.  You spot a rabbit lurking\nin the undergrowth, its nose twitching as it watches you.  A fallen oak\nprovides the perfect resting place in this peaceful haven.  You could\nsit here forever in this comforting, untouched place.\n",})
