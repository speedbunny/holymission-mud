Faces such as Annakin Skywalker, his son Luke, and his daughter Leia.\n  There are also pictures of the teachers of the mystic arts of the Jedi.  Faces such as Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda fill this section.  You feel very comfortable here in this place because you know that you are well protected here. \n  For if Bido is not here, he soon will be...\n","You seem to have just entered the trophy room of Bido, the Golden One.\nOn either side of the room there are two glass cases containing various items,\nthat tell the tale of the training of the young Bido's training.\n  In the very back of this Large room you see Bido's quite old and quite \nwell preserved Incom T-65 Space Superiority Fighter, or as most of you \nmight recognize, the X-wing.  In the glass case to your right, you find your\nattention caught by some interesting looking old clothing, something similar\nto what a farmer might wear, if he lived on Tatooine.  On a shelf above this, you \nnotice a familiar sight to those of you who know of the legends of the Jedi.\nIt appears to be a very crude model of the handle that you notice that Bido\nalways carries.  It looks like it might even be his first!  Next to that is \nthe utility belt that as of late, he has seen fit to lay aside.  You wonder\nwhat might be in such a small compartment\n  In the second case, the one to your left, you notice a head!  No, it \njust looked like a head for a minute there, whew!  It is actually a helmet.\nIt is a leering black helmet with large eyes and a triangular grill for a mouth.\nPerhaps you have seen this before somewhere.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
