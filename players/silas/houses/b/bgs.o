rooms_desc ({"A big central room. There are cables leading to the room to the north.\nYou can hear the noices of computers for north.\nTo the east you see another room.\n","This is the computer room. There are many high tech computers.\nYou see a small hexium, a PowerPC620, a Vax 9500, a Sun and a C90 !\nThere is a central terminal sorrounded by giant speakers, two sub bases and a huge monitor.\nYou can SMELL the computers !\n","This room is used to leave thing temporarely! Of course not valuable things.\nFor those there is another room.\n","You are in a nice living-room. The room is full of plants what gives the sensation of a jungle.\nIn a corner there is a nice and big parrot watching you. There are several\nchairs and a big table full of fruits. You can feel the calmness of this\nplace.\n","This is a small sanctuary. There is a crucifix of Csakany on the wall.\nHe hangs on his own tie !!!\nYou feel a big relief as you see the blood slowly dropping from the corpse !\n","You enter in a room that is more or less circle shaped. There is some kind\nof control panel near wall. You can see many lights shimmering on it.\nOn the far side there is some kind of platform with eight circles with about\ntwo feet of diameter and a nineth one much bigger in the center. With a \nsudden idea you check the control panel again and you see that there are\nthree big, labeled buttons on it among the others. You can read 'shop',\n'guild' and 'church' on them. But where is Geordi ?\n","You find yourself in a big treasury. It's full of gold, diamonds and \neverything valuable you can only imagine. In the center you can see a six\nfeet tall mountain of gold coins with a nice golden crown.\nA so immense sight of treasures makes you think about the value of everything.\nAlthough you could use it you realize that money it's not eveything and you\ndon't even want to touch anything. You feel that you have made an important\nstep ahead in your short life. \n","This is the bedroom. It's a comfortable warm room with a nice big\nbed. On the bed there is .... Ooopss ...\n    ( ! )  \n        `  \n          O    ( ? )\n         /\\__O '  \n         > > \\\n\nHm.... maybe you'd better leave them alone !\n","You entered in the dungeon. It is a small one but fully furnished with \neverything a dungeon should have. You can see chains hanging on the wall.\nThere are several strange objects you don't even dare to think what they\nare for. There are a couple of whips hanging on a hook. You also see a\nbig chest in the corner with something like a mouth peg hanging out.\nYou can smell strange things in the air and you know that this place is \noftent used. You feel the urge to leave or you might be kept here for a\nlonger period you originaly wanted to.\n","This is an ancient weapon store. It is praticaly a big circle with a \ndiameter of 6 meters. There are several swords on the wall with some \nshields among them. There are all kinds of them from ancient Egypt,\nsamurai swords from Japan and China , from medieval Europe.\nThere are some spanish and french swords from the eighteenth century.\nYou see some shorter weapons you've never seen before.\nIn the front wall there is only one weapon . It's a very old samurai\nsword with ivory figures on it. You can feel a strange force field\naround it that keeps you away from it. Somehow you know that it wouldn't\nbe a good idea to touch it.\n",})
