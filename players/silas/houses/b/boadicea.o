rooms_desc ({"You are in the front garden of a lovely thatched-roof cottage nestled in the beautiful English Cotswolds. The roses are in full bloom and the window boxes are overflowing with scarlet red geraniums. Please go in and make yourself at home. North\n","You have entered a small but cozy sitting room. On the south and west walls\nare windows covered with curtains, that match the sofa and chairs, decorated in\na Laura Ashley print. A warm fire glows in the fireplace located on the east \nwall.  Come on back to the kitchen. Mom is waiting for you.  North\n","You immediatly feel you are welcome here. An old shiny black woodstove\non the east wall is filling the room with warmth and the mouth-watering\naroma of apple pie baking to a rich golden brown. A pot of soup simmers\nalong side a softly whistling tea kettle. On the west wall, standing proudly,\nis an old oak cupboard showing off a collection of antique Wedgewood\nchina. In the middle of the room is an old butcher block kitchen table worn\nwhite with years of use. There are four chairs surrounding the table inviting \nyou to sit and rest your mind and body. Sitting on the table is a Cookie Monster\ncookie jar filled to the brim with Toll House chocolate chip cookies. Nearby \nstands a frosty pitcher of ice cold milk. Have some cookies and milk, or tea\nif you perfer.\nYou are welcome here anytime to sit and chat and leave the rest of the world\nbehind.\n","This room is for the use of my love and I only.\nIt is dimly lit by the glow from a roaring fireplace on the north wall.\nIn front of the fireplace stand two chairs. One has no arms and is low\nto the floor. The other has an ornately carved high back and large arms.\nOn the floor in front of the fireplace is the fur of a large polar bear.\nComing out from the south wall, is a very large round platform bed covered in\nfur throws of all types and colours. \nTwo large fur covered pillows set at the head of the bed.\nThis room is has been made by two people who love each other very much,\nand plan on spending hours together sharing that love with each other.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,})
