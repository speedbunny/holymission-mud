rooms_desc ({"You have entered the Living Room. You see a wonderful couch that looks\nextremely comfortable, and might be used for a little necking on various\noccasions. The northern wall has a picture hanging on it of Brent and\nLocket hugging, with Bladecutter in the background, smiling happily. You\nnotice that Locket is wearing a beautiful wedding dress, and she looks \neven more desirable than she always does. You also notice that Blade is \nwearing a tuxedo, and so is Brent.\n","This is the laundry room, that also doubles as a storage room. As you\nlook around, you see a countless number of Locket's unmentionables all\nover the place. As you wonder why they are just lying there, and not in\na nice neet pile, you realize the fact that maybe Brent just finished\npulling them off of her, and had more important (and fun) things in his\nmind than being neat and proper at the time.\n","You have entered the Dining Room, where you notice a display case holding\nexpensive China. There is a large table in the middle of the room, which\nhas a tablecloth carefully placed upon it. Wonderful scents come from the\nnorth doorway, and you wonder what Brent's cooking this time. Comfortable\nlooking chairs surround the table, and you count 8 placemats set out. You\nwonder if Brents planning on a gathering anytime soon.\n","As you enter the bedroom, you feel comfortable and relaxed. You see the\nbed in one corner of the room, a window on the east wall with a wonderful\nview of a placid lake surrounded by mountains and trees. You guess that the \ndoor to the west leads to a closet. The walls are a light blue, and the \nplush carpeting is a darker shade of blue. There is a dresser on the south\nwall with a picture of Honey, Locket, and Amanda, all of which have such\nbeautiful blue eyes, that you can't bear to stop looking at them.\n","You are amazed at the amount of room in Brent's kitchen. A table sits in\nthe middle of the room, with 4 chairs surrounding it. A stove sits on the north \nwall, and is cooking up a storm. A microwave sits next to it with a sign\nabove it saying: NO POPCORN IN HERE EVER!!! You wonder why. A large fridge\nalso adorns the north wall. A doorway leads east to the porch, and another\ndoorway leads west to the washroom. And apron lying on a chair says: Kiss\nthe Cook.\n","You have walked onto the porch, and are taken aback by the wonderful \nmountain view that it has. Also you can't help but admire the placid\nlake surrounded by trees and mountains. Birds sing sweetly, and a deer\ntrys to hide behind the trees off to the north. The crisp mountain air\nrelaxes you, and almost seems to strengthen you. You really don't \nwant to leave very soon.\n","You have entered a beautiful bathroom, where Brent and Locket fulfill\nsome wild events with each other. The room is quite large, mainly for\nthe fact that Brent wanted it that way. You see a relaxing hot tub in\none corner of the room, while the bath tub is filled with bubble-bath\nand the showers fight for the rest of the room. Towels adorn the room\nand look extremely soft. Brent doesn't forget the fabric softener.\n","This room is where Brent goes when his sweetie isn't around. He can \njust about always find something to occupy his time long enough\nto keep his sanity while she's not around. Except one time, when he went\ncompletely bonkers and went on a killing spree. Many creatures fell pray to\nhis wraith, and he is no longer allowed anywhere near sharp objects any\nmore. But when Locket is around, they use this room to vent frustrations\n(usually in some form of foreplay or another).\n","   You have stepped outside the confines of the house,\nand are now free to roam arount the woods that surround\nhis little cottage. As you walk along the path that Brent made\nhimself by running around loose without anyone to tell him not\nto go there or do that.  You can sit on either side of the path on a\nrock and wait for a cute little chipmunk to come up to you and beg for a\npeanut, or look at the cute little fawns frolicing just\nover the next hill.  The sunlight filters through the trees, \nas the day comes to a close, leaving an eerie light for you to see by.\n","  This room was made so that Brent had someplace to go when he is totally\naggravated by everyone around him, and needs someplace just to go and \nthink.  If you locate him and he is in here, I wouldn't suggest bothering \nhim since chances are he isn't in the best of moods.\n  This room is dimly lit, with a black cloth couch on one wall, a bed\non the wall with the window in it.  There is also a desk with papers all\nover it.  The desk also has a lamp on it, but the bulb has burnt out, and\nthat has just added more aggrivation to him.  The radio is on full tilt, \nplaying some of Black Sabbath's best songs: Iron Man, Paranoid, Sabbath \nBloody Sabbath, Tomorrow's Dreams, War Pigs, Electric Funeral, Children of \nthe Grave, and many others... As you can see by the music choice, He \nshouldn't be bothered.  You might aggrivate him.\n",})
