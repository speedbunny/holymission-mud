rooms_desc ({"The living room.\nThis is the largest room of the house.  You see a chair in the corner and a poster hanging on the wall.\nThe room is very spacious and the house looks very humble.\n","This is the bedroom of Master Bolborn.  The bed lays at the far corner of the room.  It looks quite comfortable.  There is a large dresser and a small table in the other corner and you can see a picture on the wall.\nThis room has a large plush rug on its floor.  It reminds you of a cosy country inn in some far off place.\n","This room looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years.  There is a rather large covering of dust on the floor of the room.  You feel unwanted here...\n","This room is quite small.  There is a window that has a spectacular view of the countryside.  This room smells of wildflowers and it makes you feel quite like running through the field like you did when you were a kid.\n","This room reaks of Marijuana smoke.  The smell overwhelms you as you enter this room.  Somehow you manage to look around through the smoke and you see many hippies passing various smoking apparatus around in a circle.\nAs you stay in this room you get a strange feeling that overcomes your body.  You want to sit and join the circle.  The choice is yours...\nYou can hear reggae music coming out of a hole in the wall.\n","As you enter this room you feel as though you have entered another world.  You can see many psycotic pictures and varios other objects that appear to be melting right in front of your eyes.\nThere are a few posters on the wall.  A strobe light flashes on and off very fast.  You can see a lava lamp and some other really funky lights flashing all around you.\n","In this room you can see a small arcade, a pool table, skis, rollerblades, a computer, and other fun stuff.  In the corner you can see something rather large.  Upon further inspection you can see that it is a full size half-pipe.  \n","This room is HUGE.  It has 100 foot ceilings and extremely thick walls.  The floor is covered with weapons and other increments of destruction.  Just dont steal from here...the master doesn't like it.\n\n","This room isn't quite as magnificent as the rest of the house but it will do.  It is intended for people staying only a short period of time.\nThere is a bed and a dresser in the room and a rug on the floor.\n","This room is used to practice rock-climbing skills.  There are many different size rocks of all different difficulties.  You see one rock that stands out from the rest.\n",})
