rooms_desc ({"This room serves as an initial reception area for Blaarg and\nKarisma's guests. As one looks around, one gets an impression of an old\nbed&breakfast in New England. The floors are hardwood, polished, with a\ntraditional throw rug in the center. The walls are wainscoted up to waist\nlevel with dark-stained oak, and above it the walls are painted antique\nwhite. There is a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, and there is a\npicture hanging from the north wall.\n","This is the main hallway. The oak wainscoting and the antique white\nwalls continue, but now there are gas lamps placed at even\nintervals along either side of the hallway. The lamps are \nextremely old, but still function, and are used to light the\nhallway at night. To the west is the guest room, to the east \nis the master bedroom, to the south is the foyer, and to the\nnorth is the rose garden.\n","The New England motif continues with this room, the master\nbedroom. The walls are decorated with pictures of Blaarg's\nfriends, and on the floor is am oriental throw rug. On\nthe northern side of the room is an antique oak sleigh\nbed, and on the southern side is a marble fireplace, where \nBlaarg can make this room even more cozy. To the east, French \ndoors open out onto a deck with a wonderful view. Why don't \nyou go out there and see? \n","As you walk into this room, you are hit with the wonderful \naroma of roses...then you see why. This is Blaarg's rose garden...\na place for him to relax and get immersed in the beauty\nof nature. White and red roses are prevalent, but you \nsee some pink and yellow ones too. The beauty of this\ngarden is enough to strike awe in the most hard-hearted\nfighter...\n\nFeel free to pick one or just smell them all.....\n","This is where Blaarg's guests sleep when they come to visit\nhim. The New England walls continue in this room, and there\nis no throw rug in order to show off the hardwood floors. The\nguests sleep in a four-poster bed, and have a wonderful view of \nthe valley in the western window. \n","As you walk through the french doors, you are overwhelmed by the \nbeauty of the view that standing on the deck offers you. Just off \nthe deck is a beautiful blue lake, reflecting the image of a snow-\ncapped mountain in the background. Surrounding the lake are enormous\npine trees which are also reflected in the lake's image. As you\nlook to the east, you can tell that the sunrises must be spectacular.\n","this room holds blaarg's equip.\n",0,0,0,})
