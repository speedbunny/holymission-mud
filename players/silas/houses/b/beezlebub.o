To your left you see a small wooden table with a \ndrawer.  To your right you see a coatrack.  On the floor is a row of Beez's\nshoes (he never walks anywhere with shoes on).  On the wall next to the door\nis a clip holding a little cash.\n","You are in a small sitting room in the center of the house.  You can\nsee a small couch and a coffee table next to the wall.  There is a small\nbookcase on the other side of the room and a speaker set in the upper corner\nabove.  The room has plush carpet all over the floor and there are framed\nphotographs and pictures here and there on the walls.\n","You are in Chef Beez's kitchen.  Here is where he tempts your tastebuds\nwith his tremendous cooking ability.  The sleek black countertop is dotted\nwith appliances and untensils here and there.  There is an island in the\ncenter with rows of wine glasses and copper pots dangling above.  The two ovens\nare enough to cook for an entire army and the microwave always has a\nsteady supply of popcorn nearby.  There are cabinets and cupboards lining\nthe walls and there is a doorway to the pantry on the left.  On the floor you\ncan see a pair of bowls for Beez's dogs to eat from.  Out the\nwindow you can see a huge apple orchard with long, green grass all around.\nThe floor is black and white checkered tile and the walls are painted \nwhite.\n","You have entered one of the largest rooms you have ever seen.  It is a \ngreat room and it is furnished as if Beez expects a throng of guests sometime\nsoon.  There are all sorts of couches and beanbags dotted around the room.\nIn the center there is a sunken pit with a long couch that wraps around\nthe inside of the area.  There is a massive entertainment center with a \nhuge televison, VCR, and stereo system.  Next to the entertainment center\nare shelfs that are literally covered with Beez's favorite movies, tapes,\nand CDs.  There is a speaker set in the corners of the room and there are\nframed movie posters on every part of the walls.  Underneath your feet is\na tremendously thick carpet that you almost sink into completely.  Want to\nwatch a movie?\n","Now you are in Beez's bedroom.  The entire room is dominated by a massive\nbed that is covered with feather pillows.  There is a dresser inalong the wall and Beez's closet door stands wide open...like always.\n","You have exited the house and are standing on Beez's patio.  The patio is\nmade up of slabs of thick grey stone.  There is a chaise lounge, a table, a\nbarbeque, a huge umbrella, and many chairs.  All along the edge of the patio\nis a row of flowers.  There are steps leading down to a huge swimming pool in\nthe yard.  The sun is shining and you feel warm and extremely relaxed here.\n","You have entered Beez's storage room.  In here everyone can see why he is such\na packrat.  There are all sorts of treasures that Beez plans to find a use for\nsometime during his lifetime.  You see a bike, a cabinent, a basketball\ngoal, old chairs, boxes of books, and whatever else he has left here to look\nthrough later.\n","You are swimming in Beez's massive pool.  You are surrounded by many\ndifferent types of bushes and shrubs that hide the majority of the pool\nfrom view.  Looking in the distance, you can see a diving board peeking\nthrough the greenery at the far end of the pool.  If you duck your head under\nthe water, you can see many different tunnels that are lighted and \ncan easily be swam through.  To your right there is a huge opening that you\nare more than welcome to investigate.  The pool bottom slants beneath your\nfeet and provides for differing depths throughout the pool.\n","You have entered Beez's hideaway.  There isn't much of interest in here.  It is \njust a place for him to go and try and get away from the problems of life.\nThere is the mandantory speaker set in the upper corner along with a huge \ncomfy chair and a table with photo albums stacked on top of it.  It is in this\nroom that Beez certainly wishes he can turn off stupid guildtalk.\n","You have entered Beez's bathroom.  You see shiny black objects all around you.\nTo your left is the toilet.  Above the toilet is a rack with magazines.\nTo the right is the gargantuan bathtub.  The faucet for the tub is near the \nmiddle.  In front of you is the counter with two sinks.  A mirror stretches\nthe length of the wall in front of you.  Lights are dotted here and there in\nthe walls and can be dimmed for a nice quiet bath....alone or not.\n",})
