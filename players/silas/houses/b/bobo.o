rooms_desc ({"As you leave the portal you entered to get here and look around you can see\nyou are on the ground and bobo's house is atop a small amount of stairs\nconnecting to a porch.  the portal is part of a statue of some sort and there\nis a porch swing on the veranda.\n","When in doubt tell the truth\n","As i drive from your pearly gates i realize that i just can't stay.  All\nthose mountains kept you locked inside and hid the truth from my \nslighted eyes.  I came to you with a half-open heart, dreams upon my\nback illusions of a brand new start.  Nashville, I can't carry the \nload.  Is it my fault that i can't reap what i sow?  Nashville did\nyou give me half a chance with your southern style and your hidden \ndance?  All those voices, they whisper through my walls, they talk\nof falling fast, they say i'm losing it all.  They say i'm running \nblind to a love of my own but i'll be walking proud, i'm saving what\nI still own.  I fell on my knees to kiss your land, but you are so\nfar down i can't even see to stand.  Nashville you forgot the human\nrace, you see with half a mind.  What colors hide the face?\nNashville i'd like to know your fate.  I'd like to stay awhile but\ni've seen your lowered state.  Today i'm leaving but i've got all \nthese debts to pay.  We all have our dues, i'll pay them some other\nplace.  I never ask that you pay me back, we all arrive with more I\nleft with less than i had.  your town is weak from people walking \nthrough, last chance for a cause well i thought i knew.  I'm \nrunning away.\n","\nin the center of this room is a nice hot large hot tub.  It looks as if\nit could hold many people and yet is personal enough for two.  There is\nmarble style tiling around it for about five feet.  Surrounding that is\nnice plush new carpet.  There is a fire place in the center of the west\nwall.  There is a wet bar in the north-west corner.  There is a big bear\nrug in front of the fire place.  This room is very cozy and dimly light.\nthere is a radio built into the south wall.\n","hi there have fun.\n","This room is so sad and unhappy.  is there no way to cheer it up? it has\nnothing while it feels society has everything that's not fair is it?  Please\nplease make this room happy and it will love you forever.\n","As you enter this room you think to yourself'This is a big room.'  It has\nall the amenities of a normal bedroom except on a grand scale.  You feel\nlike Goldilocks siting in Papa Bears chair not overwhelmingly large but\ndefinately noticable.  The bed is in the south eastern corner.  It is \nsurprisingly small in comparison with the rest of the room perhaps 1.5\ntimes the size of a twin size bed.  There is a closet in the south wall.\nThere is a large desk on the west wall.  There is a huge dresser on the\nnorth wall next to the door.  The vast majority of the room is empty\nmaking the dwarfing quality all the more noticable.\n","As you enter the pool the heat makes you want to get into somethin a little\nless bulky.  You see two locker rooms along the south wall maybe you should\ngo get changed.  The pool itself is eight lanes and is 25 yards long.  There\nis a big high-tech score board on the west wall ready to display any results.\nThere is a dingy little man underneath operating it.  Also along the west wall\nis a lane line holder.  Along the east wall is patio furniture including\nchairs, recliners, and tables where you can watch people swimming.\n","this will be detailed later\n","If I can't love you\nI don't want to love you\nIf I can't hold you\nI don't want to be thinking of you\nAnd if you don't want me\nI don't want to want you\nAnd if you won't see me\nI don't know what to do\nBut I keep watching you\nOh I keep watching you\nUntil I see right through\nOh I keep watching you.\n",})
