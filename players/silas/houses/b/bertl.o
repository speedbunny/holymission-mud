In the middle is a great table.\n\n","The Entrance-Hall.\n\nEverywhere on the walls you see lighted torches. The room is dimely lit with\nthem.

Sie scheinen den Benutzer zum ausruhen aufzufordern.\nIn der Mitte des Raumes brennt ein gedaempftes Feuer, das den Raum nur\nnotduerftig erleuchtet, die Symbole, die uberall in die Wand eingelassen sind\naber zu verhaltenem Gluehen anregt.\n","The garden in front of the house.\n\nYou see different kinds of seats standing around on a well build meadow.\nIn the middle of the meadow is a pool.\nThis place looks nice for having partys.\n\n","The Laboratory of Bertl's.\nHere he is normaly for his own :)\n\nYou see many strange things lying around on a big table.\nThere is a fireplace to the east and bottle with a boiling potion stands\nthere.

A strange smell is in\nthe air\nOn the west wall there are many shelfs full with books and different kinds\nof glasses with mage-ingredients.\nThere is a bed to the north wall, if Bertl isn't very fond of going home ;)\n(or maybee he is to drunk) :)\nTo the south you see a dark window to an other dimension and an\nrefrigerator.\n","A dimly lit corridor.\nTo the left is the kitchen\n","Say a dimly lit corridor.\n\nThe Sleeping room is to the west.\n","You entered the kitchen.\n\nIts a nice room, with a large table for eating and filled up with\ndifferent things neede for cooking :)\n","The sleeping room.\n\nThe only thing it contains at the moment, is a large bed.\n","The Bathroom of Bertl.\n\nDont look to exactly, maybee its not cleaned up at the moment :)\n",})
