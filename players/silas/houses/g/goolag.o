The high arched ceiling makes you feel small indeed and your \nvoice echos off the walls.  To the north you see a huge sliding glass \ndoor leading to the back yard. To the west you hear a rucus as if someone\nwas having a party that has gotten out of hand. Another corridor breaks off\nto the east but the dark and damp hallway gives you an erie feeling and you \nthink it is better you do not go that way.**\n","The trees around you seem to crowd in making you travels hard\n","\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou are here\n","     The sound of water dripping begins to wear on your nerves as you\nwalk ever so cautiously down the erie corridor.

You look around and see a single chair with a form sitting in it and a huge banner hung on the wall which contains writing of some kind.  The room is lit by a solitary candle and besides the stone surrounding, and what you have seen i completely empty.  As you move toward the figure he moves into the shadows so you cannot see his true form and places one finger over his mouth as if to say \"shhhhhhh....please do not make any noise.\"  and then points another finger at the banner as if to say \"read and you will understand.\n","You have enter a massive bedroom.  You are startled as you realize that this is the only room you have been in so far that has been kept up so far.
