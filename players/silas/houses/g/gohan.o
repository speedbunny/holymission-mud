Please feel free to use one to store your jacket...and\ndon't worry, I use LOTS and LOTS of mothballs.  Just then, your \nnose starts to get ichy from the strong aroma of mothballs!!! J/K.\nTo the east, you see a small kitchen, and to the north, lies my\nliving room.  Don't forget to wipe your shoes on my \"Welcome\" mat.\nRelax and make yourself feel at home :).\n","\tYou have walked into a small cozy looking kitchen.  There is\na table to the left wall, holding my rice cooker.  To the right wall\nthere is a fridge, with a Sharp microwave on top.  There is also a\nsmall stove and the sink and all the cupboards on the right wall.\nStraight in front of you lies the window.  Since we are on the \nfifteenth floor, if you wanted to jump, you would hit the window \nguards head-on.  Be my guest, but I don't suggest it.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
