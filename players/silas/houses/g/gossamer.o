There is a large bar and entertainment system along the north\nwall and a crackling fireplace along the southern wall. The bar is laden\nwith all her favorite alcohols, especially Irish Cream. The entertainment\nsystem usually plays the Lion King soundtrack, for Gossamer is a Disney\nfanatic. She also has scattered a few yellow beanbags on the plush carpet\nfor your sitting enjoyment. Feel free to make yourself at home here.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
