Back on the north wall is an entrance to the new Holy Mission Wedding\nChapel. In the east wall you notice the entrance to a small side room, the\nchurch portal opens to the south. You feel the peace and holiness of this\nplace and you are sure the gods would punish the sacrilage of shedding blood\nhere. There is a sideroom to the west.\n\nPlease note: We don't like serial killers.\n             Offenders will be punished.\n\nWE ARE NOT OFFICIALLY OPEN - YOU PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK. SO BE WARNED AND DONT\nCOME CRYING IF YOU DIE! ALSO TAKE NOT THAT THE MUD IS OPEN TEMPORARILY. IT\nCOULD CLOSE OR CRASH AT ANY TIME. BE WARNED!!!!!!\n","This is the temple of Silas. In front of you a a VERY large idol of a golden\nsheep. You feel the urge to get on your knees and start worshipping it. The\nroom is simply decorated in gold silk curtains and drapery. There are a few\nwindows that allow the sun to magnificantly shine on the sheep before you.\nThere are a few pews towards the back of the room. Take notice that noone\nis in here. The room is very silent.\n","You have entered a long dark hallway. You can see a tiny light at the end\nof the hallway. You feel stirs of cold air coming from that direction\nalso. As you move closer the east, you feel wierd sensations of raw energy\nand power flowing freely through you. You wonder what it could be.\n","This is Gehenna's storage room. She keeps all her things she gathers\nthat she doesnt need here and then takes them to the shop at the end\nof the day to sell them. Funny tho, thieves come every time there is\na reboot and steal all her stuff away. Maybe someday she will be able \nto stop that. \n","You are deeper into the hallway. You start to shiver from the chill rushing\nthrough the air. You notice the light from the east is a glowing black. You\nsee streams of colored mana flowing past you to the west. Transleuscent beams\nof energy tingle your skin as you move nearer to the east door. A sudden fear\ncomes accross you as you feel the power inflicted upon you from that room.\nYou see an inscription on the door to the east.\n","Everything is dead silent in here. Four large columns stand erect in four\npoints of a large elaborate pentagram carved into the floor. Candles are\narranged in a way not understood to your inferiority. There is an alter at\nthe top point of the pentagram. Upon the alter you see the tools in which\nGehenna uses for her spell castings and rituals. There is a cauldron of blood\nbeside the alter. The smell hints that a recent event occured. The room is\nquite warm considering the chill in the hallway. Yet you still are overwhelmed\nby the enormous amount of power you feel in this room. There is a shelf made\nof wood that supports Gehenna's books. You might recognize some of the books.\nHanging from the ceiling is a chandalier which holds 70 candles. The elegance\nof the room is surprising for a room which holds unsightly festivals of evil\nand summons ungodly horrible creations. You feel like you are not wanted here.\n","A cozy little room where Gehenna like's to sit and talk with people. You\ndefinately feel welcome here. There is a couch on the wall, two loveseats\nnear the fireplace and a table with chairs around it, in the center of the\nroom. On top of the fireplace you see pictures of Gehenna's family and\nfriends. There are a few posters and wall hangings on the walls around you\nthat seem to draw your attention. Take a look at them. You hear the faint\nnoice of people partying in the room to the west.\n","        GGGG  AAAA  N    N  JJJJJ  AAAA\n        G     A  A  NN   N    J    A  A\n        G     AAAA  N N  N    J    AAAA\n        G GG  A  A  N   NN    J    A  A\n        G  G  A  A  N    N  J J    A  A\n        GGGG  A  A  N    N  JJJ    A  A\n\n\n           TTTTTT  II  M   M  EEEE  !!\n             T     II  MM MM  E     !!\n             T     II  M M M  EEE   !!\n             T     II  M   M  E     !!\n             T     II  M   M  EEEE  **\n\nThis is the room that Gehenna likes to throw her parties.\n","This is Gehenna's bedroom. The room is half empty except for a large bed\nthat is completely dressed in leather. Leather sheets, leather blankets,\nleather pillows, the works. Also there is a footdresser on the bed. You see\nthat one of the drawers is open. There are rings, buckles, ropes, and \ncords attached to the bed and dresser, in which you suddenly start to\nfeel kinky. You also see a sign on the wall with a small inscription on\nit. The room has a few pictures, but the wallpapering is that of many\nskeletons in various sexual positions. You start to wonder what Gehenna is\nlike in bed.\n",0,})
