rooms_desc ({"You have just entered the magnificent mansion that is Gothrog's house\nA portal to the church (tastefully done in oak) is here\nEntrances to the east and west wings are here\n","This is the entrance to the east wing. It has a high vaulted\nceiling and many tapestries hang on the walls.\nA strong light comes from the south\n","This is the entrance to the west wing. Fine tapestries adorn the walls\ntogether with pictures of Gothrog's ancestors. It all looks rather sombre\nand dark. The room is lit by a candleabre hanging from the ceiling\n","This is the west wing drawing room where Gothrog entertains his guests\n\nTwo red leatherbound armchairs and a red leatherbound sofa are arranged\naround a genuine Dunedain iron fireplace. A fire burns merrily in\nthe grate. In the corner is a drinks cabinet and a bell pull\n","\nUpon entering this room you have to immediately shield your eyes - the\nlight is blinding in here. As your eyes adjust, you begin to make out\nimmense pillars of pure amethyst stretching up to the roof. A table of\nclear quartz floats here, with a bowl brimming over with exotic fruits\nsitting on it.\n","This is the library where Gothrog comes to study during exams. The walls\nare lined with ancient tomes detailing the three ages. A highly polished\nscimitar hangs on one wall\n","This is the banquetting hall where Gothrog eats and drinks. Looking up,\nyou can see the blackened oak beams of the roof. A long elm table is here\non which stand two huge brass candlesticks\nA passageway to the kitchen (south) is sectioned off by a velvet curtain.\n","This room returns to the more traditional style to which Gothrog is\naccustomed. A large four poster is centred against the east wall, with a\ndoor to the bathroom set alongside. The south wall contains a fireplace\nand two large lead latticed windows look out onto the lawn\n","This is the bathroom off the master bedroom. The tub is HUGE, with bubbles\nmagically arising from the bottom effervessing furiously at the surface.\nA comfy leather lav. is here as well, for when gothrog wants to contemplate\nlife, and a large washbasin and mirror are attached to the south wall\n","Upon entering the kitchen, your nose is assaulted by the rich spicy smells\ncoming from the cooking of unfamilar meats and puddings. There is a large\nstove in the corner of room and a large fireplace contains a spit on which\nis roasting a large haunch of venison. The atmosphere is dark and smoky.\n",})
