On the walls you see all\ndifferent sorts of paintings.  I'n the far corner of the room is where\nGriffon does all of her art works.  Above the drawing table there hang\npictures of dragons, faeries, X-men, and heros.  Scatered in the corner\nare many pens, pencils, paints and papers.  On the east wall is a \nfish tank.  There is another chandiler hanging from the ceiling.\nThe room is a suptle burgande colour.  The carpet is white.\n","You have entered Griffons private bed chamber. There is a queen sized \nsleigh bed on the north wall covered in a dark green comforter and many\nfeather pillows. Next to the bed is a round table that has a candlabra\non it, so that Griffon can read in bed. The large dresser is where she does\nher make-up. There are 3 chairs here, just incase she invites someone up\nto talk infront of the large fireplace. In the far corner there is a \nscreen behind which, Griffon dresses. The walls are painted a pale yellow\nwith little blue fluer-des-lis placed evenly at intervals. The lower part\nof the wall is wooden, and the floor is covered in a thick, soft, white \nshag carpet.\n","This is the room where you can normally find Griffon and Morrolan if \nthey are at home.  The room is painted in a briliant red colour and the\nfloor is covered with a fine velvatine red carpet to match.  A sofa,\nlove seat, and chair sit around a small coffee table.  The contrast of\nthe black leather furniture makes the room look very modern, and in fact, \nit is.  There is a big screen TV off on the south wall next to the only \nwindow in the room.  Beautiful black silk drapes hang on the window.  There\nis a large knick-nack shelf on the north wall, here there are all sorts\nof collectables.  A large book shelf sits on the west wall, and houses \nmany fine novels and historical books.  From the ceiling hangs a large\nover-head fan, that can be turned on to cool the room in the summertime\nor any other time it might get hot in here.  \n","This is Griffon's solarium, here, she can look out the huge glass window\nand watch the animals go by in the forest beyond and watch her roses \ngrow in her garden.  Sunlight pours in from the window to light the room\nand it seems to shine into the room to the west.  There is a fine\nwicker set with bright green cushion's set about the room to sit on.\nThere is a coffee table in the middle of the room, you think perhaps \nthis is where Griffon entertains guests in the summer time.  On the wall \nopposite the windows, there is a copy of Monet's Water Lily's hanging.\nA small book shelf, houses many novels, nick-nacks, and a picture\nof Griffon's boy friend.  Flowers sent the room from vases all over the\nroom.  The floor is made of finest mahogany wood and the walls are \ncovered with a bright floweral paper.\n","You have entered into Griffon's entertainment room.  In the far corner\nstands a gaint big screen TV with a sega genesis hooked up to it, games\nscater the floor. On the east wall stands a pinball machine, a dart board, \nand a Street Fighter II Super Turbo machine.  On the west wall sits a \nMortal COmbat II machine for when Mark and Matt come over to visit.\nThe center of the room is taken up by a pool table and the couch that\nsits in front of the TV.  There is a VCR on top of a sterio rack system.  \nThere is a whole shelf system full of CD's, tapes, and VCR tapes in the \ncorner beside the sterio on the north wall.  There hangs a ceiling light\nover the pool table much like in a pool parlor.  The walls are covered\nwith posters of different musical groups.  The floor is covered by a \nnice thick, blue shag carpet.\n","You have entered into the dinning room.  A huge 14 seat rectangular table\ntakes up most of the room.  The table is always set, just incase company\nshows up at the last minute.  The table is covered in a fine linen cloth\nand fine china and silverware are placed perfectly on the table.  Maybe\nGriffon has a house keeper?  I beautiful candleabra sitts in the middle \nof the table.  Though, there is also a chandalier hanging from the ceiling.\nThe room its self is as dark as most of the rest of the house, it is \npainted a deep purple colour, and even the carpet is purple!!  The only\nlight in the room comes from the 2 light sorces and the white table \ncloth.\n","This is the chateau's only bathroom.  You'd think that there would be\nat least one more for such a large house, but there isn't.\n   The room its self is very large and houses a queen sized hot tub.\nThe hot tub is hiden under a wooden window area.  There is also a bath tub\nand shower in plain sight.  Of course there is the toilet and the sink, \nthese are seperated from the rest of the room by a wooden door and \ndividing wall.  Griffon seems to have kept this room very simple in \ncolours, for the room is a pale light blue colour.  Towels and carpets\nare the exact same colour as the walls, and seem to blend in, almost \nhiding themselves.  A large floor length mirror hangs on the main \ndoor, to check your clothing before you leave.\n","This is Griffon's ENORMOUS kitchen.  Cabinets cover every wall in here, you\ntend to wonder if she's got enough space in here.  The sink sits under\na large window, and the microwave hangs under a cabinet.  There is a large\nisland that houses the stove burners.  There is a double oven on the\nwest wall and a pantry on the east wall.  The fridge is one of those \ncomputerised ones that makes ice and all that junk, its over on the south \nwall.  The room is a basic white, and the floor is covered in a soft\nblue and white lanolium floor.\n","HI\n",})
