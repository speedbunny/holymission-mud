It has everything you ever wantedbut those things, unfortunatly, aren't accessible at this time, so you will have be satisfied with what is here at the moment, he will be adding more later.You see a beuatiful table in the corner where Gord writes his adventiures,and on the wall you see a painting. You feel a soft substance under feet anddecide to take your shoes off. By the way if you mess around in my houseand start to wreck things I will have to expell you forever.","This is a room full of exciting things at the moment you may not examineeverything though, but that will change. Just examine everything and youwill know which you can look at.	This room is decorated with beautiful wall paper made from paper aswellas gold leaf. You can see a bed in the corner, and a painting on the eastwall, over in the corner you spy a ball covered in saliva, looks like thereis a dog living here too. On the west wall is a bunch of trophies from Gord's wonderess journeys, they look very interesting, on the ground you seea rug with a very weird texture.	To the north you see a wall that is different from the others.","You have entered a room with 18 fires and a storage room for feul.You have accidently stumbled onto the Pyromaniac's Guild, run byBonzo. To join this guild all you have to know is that burningthe house you are in is very illegal to the guild and you will get kicked out of the guild in an instant.	Just type \"Join\" to join and go to the adventurers guild for raisingstats and levels.On the east wall you see a picture of Gord, Galadriel and Bonzo Burningdown the church.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
