No trouble of wizards or players\nbugging him and he can just do what he wants, when he wants, and\nwith whoever he wants.  It's just a plain little room that has no \nitems or objects in it.\n","Gambit uses this room when he feels the need to be alone and just code.\nThe room itself is very plain and nothing is in it.  The room doesnt\nbug Gambit to be this way since this is how he wanted it.\n","This room is filled with all the comforts of dining and among other things.\nSoft, sweet music is being played in the air and a long dining room table\nfills the whole room.  For some reason, there are only two chairs for\nthis huge table.  Candles are burning slowly as they decorate the table\nand a bottle of wine is chilling on ice in a gold plated bucket.\nYou can see a maid and a butler walking around and taking care of things,\nall to make this very romantic...\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
