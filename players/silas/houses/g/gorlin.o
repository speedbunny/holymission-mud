rooms_desc ({"This is the entrance room to Gorlin's Manor.\nYou can leave your shoes and your travel clothes\nhere, and there is also a shelf to put hats on it.\nYou see one of Gorlin's housekeeping faeries bust-\nling through the room, cleaning a speck of dust \nfrom your dirty travel clothes (That's Gorlin's\nhousekeeping service...since he is absolutely\nunable to keep his house clean by himself, he\nasked some friendly faeries to do this job. Give\nthem a candy if you see them, please.)\n","This is a hallway in the southern part of the manor.\nYou can see a shelf with something on it.\n","This is a comfortable living room. It contains a table with\nsome very comfortable chairs around it, a bar, and a\ncupboard. Through the windows to the east you can see\na garden.\n","This is Gorlin's garden. He often comes here to relax a\nbit after having one of his tedious adventures. You\ncan see many flowers here, and their scent refreshens\nyou. To the east you can see a path through the bushes.\n","You now can see a beautiful pond in Gorlin's garden.\nThis is also a place for relaxation and meditation.\nFeel free to rest here!\n","You have entered Gorlin's bedroom. It is tastefully\ndecorated. You can see a bed here. There also are\ntwo cupboards and a chest in this room.\n","This is Gorlin's workroom. Since he doesn't work overly much,\nit is currently very empty. But you can expect, that when he\nfinally becomes a wiz it will get quite crowded in here.\n","You are in a jungle north of the garden. A small path leads\nsouth. From the north water flows down to a sparkling waterfall,\nleading the clear water to a little pond. You hear birds\nchirping in the vicinity. In the middle of a little clearing\nstands a jacuzzi.\n","This is a small shrine full of flowers. On a white stone\nthere is a portrait showing Amy, Gorlin's great love.\nGorlin often comes here just to look at her portrait....\n","This room is used for special occasions, like parties\nand other festivities.\nAt the moment it is empty and unused.\n",})
