rooms_desc ({"You have entered the living room of New, the Fighter.You notice magazines and books strewn about, also many unfinished projectsare awaiting his attention.  You think that there must have been a recentearthquake, however, you have the feeling that there is some order inthis room.  Despite the chaotic dissaray of this room, you feel at ease.","You are amazed that this room is even more disorganized thanthe Living Room.  You see a Macintosh computer andeven more unfinished projects.  Bookshelves line the wallsand are crowded with papers, magazines and books.The North wall is taken up completely by a large aquarium.It looks as if you could enter it by going north.However, you must avoid stacks of papers and books to evenmove around in this room.","You have entered the aquarium.  This is a nice pleasant place whereNew comes to relax.  You see many beautiful fish swimming around the tank.You notice a brilliant orange and white clown fish playing in an anemone.A huge Dragonfish glides through the water towards you.  You also noticean rainbow colored anglefish, hiding behind some of the live coral to the east.You feel at peace.","You have entered the storage room.If you are lucky you will find lots of armour, weapons and treasure.Occasionally, Fighter New will leave a pile of gold here too.Unfortunately, you are likely to find even more piles of junk, than inthe living room.","You leave New's house and are briefly startled by the crisp freshair.  This is the freshest air you have ever had the pleasure ofbreathing. You are walking on a beautiful green lawn. The brightsun above warms you.You see Fighter New's house to the North. Eastward is an orchardand garden.  An Old Growth Forest towers to your west, and thewaters of the Hood Canal invite you to swim south.","You enter New's sanctuary. This is where New comes whenhe needs to be alone.If you're here, you shouldn't be!",0,0,0,0,})
