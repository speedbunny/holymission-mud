As your gaze\ncomes off the floor, you notice the north wall.  It is all floor to ceiling\nwindows with a beautiful set of french doors.  In the corner to the left of\nthe windows is an intriguing little waterfall.  It falls into a small pond\nfilled with goldfish.  A stream flows out of the pond through the north wall.\nIn the other corner, you see a rather old but beautiful and sturdy cherry   \nwood rocking chair.  It reminds you of your grandparents perhaps.  The rest \nof the room is done tastefully done in white with a pastel peach border \nalong the ceiling with matching peach curtains.  A table with a large vase\nfilled with brilliant orange carnations stands in the middle of the room.\n","As you come out through the french doors, you are taken aback by a large,\nbeautiful flower garden.  There are a large variety of flowers here.  On the\nright side of the path are camillia's, dasies, forget-me-nots, joy, cornflowers,\ngeraniums, lonquils, bluebells, lilacs, daffodils and lillies. On the left sde\nof the path are magnolias, roses, tulips, peonies, violets, morning glories,\nperiwinkles, sunflowers, sweet pea blossoms, wisteria, orchids, and sweet\nwilliam.  There is a book labeled \"The Language of Flowers\" on  a glass p     \npedastal.  You also notice that the stream that started in the house meanders\nthroughout the garden and reenters the house again.  There are several stone \nbenches placed throughout the garden to sit and look at the flowers.  This\nis a very romantic place\n","This is a small, cozy sitting room.  The north wall is all windows looking\nover the beautiful garden.  A loveseat sits facing the window.  There is a \nsmall vase vase filled with flowers from the garden sitting on a table in\nthe northeast corner.  On the west wall, you see a painting.  To the south, \nsee a door.\n","As you go out through this door, you enter a small apple orchard.  The trees\nare in perfect lines.  The apples almost look like wax.  You hear buzzing\nof bees from several hives located throughout the orchard.  The\ntrees are full of ripe, red apples.\n","The hardwood floor continues into this room but what catches your eye as you\nenter the study is a magnificant desk.  You notice the deks takes up most of\nthe southwestern corner.  A large bookcase takes up part of the eastern wall \nand contains several books by the some of the authors of the time and \nmanuscripts by plato, socrates and other great philosophers/playwrigths.\nOn the rest of the east wall are pictures of Notud's ancestors.  In the\nnortwestern corner are two chairs and a small table.\n","You feel a somber mood descend over you as you enter this room.  This is where\nNotud comes to think out his problems.  In the middle of the room\nsits a couch and two chairs for his real good friends to sit in\nwhile they talk with about his and their problems.  Scattered about the\nroom are ferns, pansies, heather and petunias.  The norhtern wall is made of \nglass and looks into a small atrium.\n","You step onto plush carpeting as you enter the master bedroom.  What\nreally cathes your eye is the magnificant, four-poster bed in the center\nof the room.  It has a soft down matress and pillows to match.  The sheets\nare made of the softest cotton.  An oak hope chest lies at the foot of\nthe bed.  Along the west wall sits a nicely carved cherry dresser.  A\nsmall cherry vanity with and exquisite mirror above it sits along the north\nwall.  Several candles placed around the room and the slight smell of \ninscense gives the room a romantic atmosphere.\n","The room feels a little humid as you enter it.  The source of that humidity\nseems to be a curious little pond with a waterfall to the right.\nOn the northern wall, you see a glass-enclosed room filled with steam.\nA little to left on the wall in front of you is a beautiful marble\nwas basin with a mirror above it.  As you look up, you see the roof is made\nentirely of windows to let the sun or perhaps to let one look out at the\nstars at night.  Two soft, cotton robes hang to the right of the door.\n","Mmmmm...the steam starts to relax you right away.  As you look around,\nyou notice this steam room is only built for two.\n","As you enter the room, you realize is is completely enclosed in glass.  It is\nbare except for some petunias and heather around the room.  This is where\nNotud comes to be in complete solitude when he wants to think things\nthrough.  It overlooks a small, peaceful lake just outside.\n",})
