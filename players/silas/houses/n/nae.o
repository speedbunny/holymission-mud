So take off your coat, kick off your\nshoes, and get ready...there may be some surprises waiting for you.\n","This room is giant! Obviously, Nae must love her baths. As you look around, \nyou see all the things that she enjoys in here:  the bubblebath, the\nsoaps, the bath oils, and an assortment of bath tools. One wall is devoted\nto holding a giant mirror, with shelves on either sides. A towel rack holds\nher towels, and to the east is the largest tub you've ever seen!\n","You step through the doorway, and are transported into a winter \nhideaway...\n\nAlthough you see snow through the windows, this room is snug and warm,\nthanks to the fireplace across from you. This room seems so safe, with\nheavy wooden doors, bookshelves all along one wall, and a couple of\nleather chairs in a corner, waiting for you to sit in them. In front \nof the fireplace, a giant fluffy rug lies inviting you to lie down\nand enjoy the ambience of the fire.\n","You slide slowly into the tub, letting the water inch it's way up your body.\nAs you look around, you scoop up some bubbles and blow them playfully around\nthe room. You decide a long bath is just what you needed.\n","As you enter this room, the faint hint of Nae's perfume lets you know this\nis an entirely feminine room. The high, four-poster bed has a victorian\nlace comforter, and several pillows dressing it up. Against one wall is\nNae's dressing table, with her cosmetics and perfumes scattered on top.\nThere is a small bookshelf near her bed, for those nights when she can't\nsleep. You think you see another small room to the south, but it's just\nher walk-in closet.\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","It's just another empty room, just like all the rooms in Nae's house.\n","You step through the doorway, and are transported to a moonlit forest...\n\nThe moonlight dapples the ground below you, and though the ground is dry the\nair has the fresh scent of rain. The trees are spaced far enough apart\nto allow freedom of movement, while still ensuring privacy...\n","This is a brand new, unfurnished room.  As soon as you see it, you\nstart imagining interesting ways to decorate it.. it could be anything,\na cupboard, a conservatory, an orchard, heaven or hell..\nA small note in the corner says:  'help build/furnish'.\n","Wow...this room is cluttered! There is a bar to your left with clothes\nhanging from it, and a row of shelves. To your right is a stack of\nboxes. You wonder what's in them...\n",})
