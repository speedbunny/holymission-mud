On the western side there are several\nguitars hung up on the wall and a big Marshall amplifier stands there\non the floor.\n","This is the kitchen of Nokey. A variety of nice smells of foods still\nlinger in the air, but the dishes of last night are still on the sink.\nIt seems that he does his dishes before cooking and not after eating\ndinner. There is a door to the west leading into the garden.\n","You have stepped into what you guess must be the garden, but looks more like\nan open place in some wild forest. The grass in which you stand\ncomes up to your knees.\nTo the north is a patch of trees, further west you can see a pond and to the\nsouth the grasslands continue.\n","This is the hallway, there are doors leading to several other rooms.\nSouth is the bedroom, north is a closet, west is the kitchen\nand east is the workroom.\n","This bedroom is as big a mess as the workroom! There is a big bed in japanese\nstyle in the center of the room and the walls are decorated with souvenirs\nand a frame with a piece of paper, a photograph and a yellow card in it.\nThere is a large window in the south wall overlooking the Holy Mission\nand to the east is the bathroom.\n","This is a closet, you can keep things here until you need them later.\n","What a mess! The desk that stands here is covered with all sorts of things\nranging from pieces of metal to microprocessor chips!\nThis is obviously a workroom, but you can hardly walk two steps without\ntripping over something! There are parts of computers, guitars, books\nwires and a lot of other things strewn about. Does this guy EVER tidy up?\n","A brightly lit bathroom. The light comes from several halogen spotlights\nin the ceiling. There is a whirlpool , a toilet and a sink here, all made of\nwhite porcelain.\nIt is very clean and tidy compared to all the other rooms you've seen in\nthis house!\n","This is a piece of the garden where there are many trees, they are\npacked together so closely that hardly any sunlight can get to the ground.\nThe almost absense of sunlight makes the vegetation on the ground very\nsparse. It is mostly covered with dead leaves, giving the air the smell of\na real forest.\n","You are swimming in a pond. Although the water is quite nice and warm,\nit is very clear. The warm water soaks the stress out of your body.\nThis is very nice, you feel relaxed and decide to stay here for a while.\n",})
