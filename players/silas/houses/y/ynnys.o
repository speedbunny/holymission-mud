There is a myriad of bowls with\ndifferent berries and nuts drying in the sun that always shines here.\nThere are several small animals frolicking about but none of them seem\ninterested in eating the drying nuts or berries. They seem content just to\nlive near the small shelter that is practically invisible in its surroundings.\nYou notice that there were no trees cut or trimmed for this shelter it appears\nto be mostly wood that looks to have been chewed by beavers. There are also\nno signs of a fire anywhere. You can enter the hut to the west or walk down\nto the stream to the east.\n","You have walked down a small path to the side of a large pool.  To your left\nupstream a waterfall feeds the pool with a gentle rumbling.\nTo your right, downstream, you can see a family of geese gently floating in\nthe gentle current. Large weeping willow trees hang over the stream providing\nshade and a gently swishing in the breeze. You feel totally at peace here.\nYou can walk back up the path to the west.\n","You have walked into this warm hut. All the comforts of home are here. There\nis a bed near the back wall made of straw and leaves. Amazingly it looks\nvery comfortable. There is a small table made of wood against the left wall\nand a rock for a stool. An extremely small firepit is in the center of the hut\nbecause even druids need a hot meal once in awhile. The tent flap opens out\nto the east.\n",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,})
