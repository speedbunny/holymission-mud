tmp_text "Hi all after catching up on the current discussion i can't but help make a \ncomment. First off Who cares is peguins eat at burger king since their \nburgers are obviuosly made of spma which the peguins put semen on(I better\nget my lawyer for the suit bound to come from BK) which of course Silas is\ndoing a Ph.d thesis on. Secondly if you wonder about strange matings what\nabout a worm gotta wonder? As for canoes everyone should know the indians \nput them on top of there 4x4's and drove across the desert(except for when\nthe women whined about bathroom breaks) while the penguins levitated the canoes and paddled there way at light speed across the desert. Boy some people. \nAlso as for tupik your to young for such mature subject nature. \nWell after reading what i just wrote i think i better stop; cause if i \ncontinue I will be taken in for psychiatric evaluation. \n\n\n       Haplo on of the originators of the light speed theory!!!\n\n**\nOkay, i just wanted to relate this all to you board subscribers\n\nI saw Billy Maidison this weekend. In the movie Billy while\nin a drunken stupor sees a giant penguin and decided to try\nto catch the penguin and send him back to antartica.\nThe penguin runs away from Billy, and i mean this \nwas no ordinaty penguin it was 6 feet tall.\nI felt like i WAS the penguin, i mean don't we all\ndeep down feel like we are the penguin, far away from home\nand being chased by druken millionaires. \nJust wondering, Tatsuo\n\n**\n  Hmm you sure it was billy in a drunken stupor? Oh well I wonder what\nyou were along way from home and being chased by a 6 foot penguin? And\nwhat if this penguin had spam to share with you? Could you go at light\nspeed to get away or would you hit a planet scattering spam and penguin \nparts all over the inhabitants who may not even like spam? \n Oh well i am going for another drink since my nerves can't handle\nthese thoughts!!!\n\n        Haplo who seriously wants to get to a drunken stupor!\n\n**\nQ. Why don't polar bears eat penguins??\n\nAnswer at a later date... I'll wait for some intuitive guesses first  >:)\n\nBig Daddy T.\n\n**\nPolar bears eat penguins because there is no other source \nof spam in the artic.  Great protien supplement\n\n**\nNo no no no no no!!!\n\nI said why DON'T polar bears eat penguins!!\n\n\nDUH! *grin*\n\nBig Daddy T.\n\n**\nBut polar bears do eat peguins. After all who could pass up spam???  This\namazes me that someone would actually think passing up spam was possible.  \nAll that wholesome nutrition which will last till voyager makes it back \nto earth(and that will be a long time!! or until it starts losing ratings).\nSpam is the only food which would survive a direct nuclear attack and still\nbe just as healthy. So polar bears do eat spam hence they must eat penguins!\nMind boggling ain't it?\n   \n            Haplo Think of no thoughts\n\n\n**\nMaybe the reason polar bears do not eat penguins is because of the distance\ninvolved between the two for penguins are native to Antarctica while polar\nbears are native to northern territories.\n\nAnd for spam, take one object - be it speed of light, planets, Star Trek,\netc., and certain people bury it to death.\n>>>>>Axlrose - ...<<<<<\n\n**\nUh, it's a joke, ya know...\n\nOh well... the correct answer is-\n\nA. Because they can't get the wrappers off...\n\nYou Americans will probably have absolutely no clue why this is funny at\nall but quite frankly I don't care at this time of night...\n\nBye bye,\n\nBig Daddy T.\n\n**\nIf polar bears don't eat penguins, then it is safe to\nassume that the average penguin makes a tasty snack for\nthe yeti.\n\nPlease elaborate\ntats\n\n**\nIf you give a polar bear, a yeti, and an eskimo each a penguin who would unwrap\nit first? \n    Any answer accepted!!!\n\n      Haplo who wonders what kind of insanity he is starting!\n\n\n\n**\nSeems I've been away entirely too long! You people have gone stark raving\nmad, with nothing to show for it but a bunch of BK penguins and Spam.\nStrange!\n\n\t\t\t-Renee\n\n**\n\n   NAE!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n  enough said!\n\n    Haplo\n\n**\nMadness is cool, take it in small doses three times a week,\nand you will live an extra 20 years.\nThat is if the Yetis don't get you first\nenough said \nTats\n\n**\nWell Madness as a drug is good but only if it is tempered by 2 doses of insanity\nInsanity is important part after all without insanity what yeti would want\nto eat you? All you become is spam used to fertilize female penguin eggs. \nBut of course with madness,insanity and yetis you will be locked up anyway. \nWhich raises several new questions. If you are taking madness and insanity and\na yeti eats you then wouyld you be better off. And who is worse a man who\nsees yetis which eat them? or a man who sees a panda and eats a yeti?\n\nWhich brings me to panda's how do they get to be white and black? \nShoe Polish maybe? spray paint? And why should we care about yetis when \nwe have panda's? And what would happen if a panda eats a man,yeti, and a\nspam penguin(who eats at burger king)?\n\n   Just a few thought from the freaked out Haplo\n\n\n\n**\nok...damn, there were a lot of notes i had to catch up on\nim like, hardly ever on anymore, i cant get near the keyboard\nnote the increase in tristans notes\nanyway...why the hell did someone put a note on here about houses?!\nlike, im sure\nthank you, tat, for clearing that up\npenguins mating-silas, i love it...\nand you seemed to have it down pretty well last time i saw you and cool, \nyour new friend...ahem!\nfuck, ballot, screwed me up\nANYWAY!\nwhere was i?  who knows...\nhow was mauthausen, silas?  *jealous look*\nill try to be on more to look at my board\nlove\ndani\n[|:)\noh yeah-what movie do y'all recommend to rent???\nand ive already seen reservpir dogs!\n\n**\n\nWhy should we care about all these things when we have Haplo?\n\n**\n\n\n    DAMN STRAIGHT!!!!\n\n\n    Haplo\n\n**\nWho says all of us care about Haplo?\n\n>>>>>Axlrose - ...<<<<<\n\n**\nEveryone should care about haplo. Haven't we all at one point\nin time felt like haplo. Feeble and alone in the big wide world.\n\nAnyway, I think everyone should compose a small note\non why Silas has made the world a better place, and what we would\ndo without him. sorta of a \"It's a Wonderful Life\" thing\n\nTatsuo\n\n**\ni think silas has made the world a better place because he takes care\nof all the lost sheep...alone and scared in the world, and he takes them\nin (literally!) and makes them feel loved.\nand he sends me good email about crazy busdrivers and people who\nmutilate gerbils.  *grin*\nand his kitten is A-1 prime, even though i couldnt catch the slippery thing\nsilas, can i touch your hot vienna sausage? please?!\n(robyn says hello *drool*\ndani\n[|:)\n\np.s.  i think we should ban axl from this happy board cause hes a poop\n:(\n\n**\nFine, I'm banished from this board - I don't give a fuck either way.\n>>>>>Axlrose - ...<<<<<\n\n**\nhes so touchy...\ndani\n[|:)\n\n**\nWhat if you're on a steady low dose 24/7? Looks like I'll be alive\nuntil around 2537!\n\nNae\n\n**\nGee, I wonder why it is that kids drool so much! Robyn drools, \nJeremy still drools,...hmmm. Strange. Maybe it's got something to do\nwith demented Yetis who ate too much spam-penguins. Or maybe it's\njust the wind...\n\n-Nae\n\n**\nsometimes i can get mark to drool too\n*grin*\nuhhh...what was i gonna write?\nso how was everyones spring break?\n*mutter*\nwelcome back, silas\nlove\ndani\n[|:)\n\n**\nNice place\nTinman wuz here\n\n**\nDon't you want to come to my place, bouncie, bouncie?\n\nSpaorm\n\n**\nWE took a vote and APPR are NOT allowed to post to our beloved board\nso take your newly discovered bboots and go away\n\nJealously Guarding the Light Speed Board, Tatsuo\n\n**\n\n**\n"
