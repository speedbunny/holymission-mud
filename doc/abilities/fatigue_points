FATIGUE POINTS
--------------

Fatigue-points are used at special abilities. They determine, how "tired"
you become when using a special ability. The system is quite similar to the
one with the spell-points. When casting a spell, you lose mana. When using
a special ability, you lose fatigue-points.

There is now a new method in the guild-room, called

   int query_maxfp( int dex, int legend_level )

This method determines the amount of maxfp the guild-member has. The first
argument passed is the dex of the player, the second is the legend-level.
Return-value is the maximum ftp the guild-member can achieve.
