Orcs are usually an evil race, but everyone is assumed to be neutral when born,
and orcs could be good. Because of their low wisdom and intelligence, however,
they are easily persuaded by the evil forces in the world. they are an black
and ugly race, but have a high constitution an are as strong as humans. They
haven't got a lot of dexterity though: like dwarves they're strong and slow.
