void lsay( string act, string msg, object src, object exclude )

act:     the action
msg:     the message
src:     the object, initiation the lsay
exclude: the object, which should not get the lsay

displays a string to all livings! who have the same environment as the src.
the room will get the message too.
this function acts like the say efun, only that it supports languages.
this is: only when the "catcher" knowns the language, the src is talking in,
he will get the correct message, otherwise (s)he will not understand the msg.
this function is used by the "say"-command.

examples:
  lsay( "says:","I love this function !", this_player(), 0 )
  all who speak in the same language as this_player(), will get
     "Name says: I love this function !"
  the other will get
     "Name says: X sdlk sdlk dslksdfs !" (not actually this, but s.t. like this)

TAKE CARE: this functions is NOT varargs !
