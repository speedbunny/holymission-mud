SYNOPSIS
        string rusage()

DESCRIPTION
        Return a string with current system resource usage statistics,
        namely: utime, stime, maxrss, rus.ru_ixrss, rus.ru_idrss,
                rus.ru_isrss, rus.ru_minflt, rus.ru_majflt, rus.ru_nswap,
                rus.ru_inblock, rus.ru_oublock, rus.ru_msgsnd,
                rus.ru_msgrcv, rus.ru_nsignals, rus.ru_nvcsw,
                rus.ru_nivcsw

        This function is optional.

	Contrary to rus.ru_maxrss, the 3rd value returned will not be in
	pages, but in bytes, since it is multiplied with the return value
	of the getpagesize() (Unix) system call.

RUSAGE(8)             MAINTENANCE COMMANDS              RUSAGE(8)



NAME
     rusage - print resource usage for a command

SYNOPSIS
     rusage command

DESCRIPTION
     The rusage command is similar  to  time(1V).   It  runs  the
     given  command, which must be specified; that is, command is
     not optional as it is in  the  C  shell's  timing  facility.
     When the command is complete, rusage displays the real (wall
     clock), the system CPU, and the user CPU times which elapsed
     during  execution  of  the command, plus other fields in the
     rusage structure, all on one long line.  Times are  reported
     in seconds and hundredths of a second.

EXAMPLE
     The example below shows the format of rusage output.

     example% rusage wc /usr/man/man1/csh (1)
     3045   13423   78071 /usr/man/man1/csh (1)
     2.26 real 0.80 user 0.36 sys 11 pf 38 pr 0 sw 11 rb 0 wb 16 vcx 37 icx 24 mx 0 ix 1230 id 9 is
     example%

     Each of the fields identified corresponds to an  element  of
     the  rusage structure, as described in getrusage(2), as fol-
     lows:

          real                elapsed real time
          user   ru_utime     user time used
          sys    ru_stime     system time used
          pf     ru_majflt    page faults requiring physical I/O
          pr     ru_minflt    page faults not requiring physical I/O
          sw     ru_nswap     swaps
          rb     ru_inblock   block input operations
          wb     ru_oublock   block output operations
          vcx    ru_nvcsw     voluntary context switches
          icx    ru_nivcsw    involuntary context switches
          mx     ru_maxrss    maximum resident set size
          ix     ru_ixrss     currently 0
          id     ru_idrss     integral resident set size
          is     ru_isrss     currently 0

BUGS
     When the command being  timed  is  interrupted,  the  timing
     values displayed may be inaccurate.
