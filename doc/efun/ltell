void ltell( object dest, string act, string msg, object src )

dest:  destination
act:   action
msg:   message
src:  source

Send a message to object "ob". If it is an interactive object (a player),
then the message will go to him, otherwise it will go to the local
function "lcatch_tell".
This function is used by the "tell"-command

example:
   ltell( find_living("llort"),"tells you:","Are you a troll ?",this_player() )

   if llort understands the language, this_player() speaks in, he will get
      "Name tells you: Are you a troll ?"
   otherwise
      "Name tells you: Ssd wre x dslkf ?"

TAKE CARE: this function is NOT varargs !!!
