This is not a function in the normal matter, but merely a way
to make all functions and variables from an object availiable
to your object without copying it entirely. The syntax is:

inherit "<filename>";

This statement must always come first in your file and it
can only be used once (multiple inheritances are not allowed).
All include-files and variable declarations must come after
the inheritance statement. When using inherit you will save
a lot of memory and this way please the game-administrators.
The filename counts from the root and not, like the 
include statement, from the current directory.
If you wish to make a function with the same name as one
in the inherited object you can still access the inherited 
one using two colons in front of the functionname. 

example:

 reset(arg) {
   ::reset(arg);
  ...

will call reset(arg) in the inherited object.
