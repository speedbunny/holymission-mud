int mapping_contains(&result,map,key)
mapping map
mixed key

Returns 1 if key is in map. result contains the value associated with the key.
Note that a reference to result has to be passed to mapping_contains, that's
what the & is good for. The result won't be overwritten if the mapping doesn't
contain a value for the index.
