void set_this_object(object_to_pretend_to_be)
object object_to_pretend_to_be

This is a privileged function, only to be used in the master object or in the
simul_efun object. It changes the result of this_object() in the using
function, and the result of previous_object() in functions called in other
objects by call_other(). Its effect will remain till the return of the using
function.
Use it with extreme care to avoid inconsistencies. After a call of
set_this_object(), some LPC-constructs might behave in an odd manner, or even
crash the game. In particular, when using global variables or calling local
functions (except by call_other) is illegal.
Allowed are call_other, map functions, access of local variables (which might
hold array pointers to a global array), simple arithmetic and the assignment
operators.
