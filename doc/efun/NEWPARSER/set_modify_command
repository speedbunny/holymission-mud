mixed set_modify_command(ob)
object ob

Call the function modify_command in an interactive object ob to modify each
command given by this_object(). This is very convenient for alias/history
tools. Upon disconnecting a set_modify_command(0) is done automatically.
Valid return values are a modified string, 0 or 1. 1 indicates that the
function doesn't wish further processing.
