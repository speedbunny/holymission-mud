int call_resolved(&result,ob,func,arg1)
mixed result,ob,arg1
string func

This function is similar to call_other. Returns 1 if the
function exists, 0 otherwise. The return value is stored in result.
Note that call_resolved calls functions which are defined in shadows
(like call_other) while function_exists ignores shadows. The first
argument result has to be passed as a reference (prefixed with a &);
it will be overwritten if the function exists and left unchanged otherwise.

See also: function_exists, call_other.
