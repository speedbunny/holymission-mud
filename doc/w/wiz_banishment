 
The banishment of wizards is a decision of the arches, with Haplo
heading up this area. All appeals should be directed to him. 
 
In severe cases, a "banishment for life" will be handed down. This
means that unless the wizard in question has an intricate area,
(s)he will be demoted, have their object file removed, and
directories wiped. If the area is intricate, another wizard will be
assigned to recode the problem area, and when that is complete,
then the previous action will follow.
 
For the most part, all banishments will be final and upheld!
