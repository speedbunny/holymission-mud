NAME
    lockgame - lock the game for different levels

SYNOPSIS
    lockgame <level>
    lockgame off

AVAILABILITY
    Archwizard	command

DESCRIPTION
    lockgame sets the lock-level of the game. After setting a lock-level,
    no player which level is below or equal the given lock-level will
    be able to log in. The player may, however, connect to the game
    and read the news in the login menu.

    lockgame takes either an integer or the string "off" as argument.
    A level of zero is equivalent to "off", in which case no login
    restrictions apply.

BUGS
    An archwizard may set any lock-level, including own and higher levels.

FILES
    /secure/login.c			login object for any connection.
					access is checked in connect()

    /secure/master.c			holds the variable lock_level and
					the modifying routines

    /sys/arch.c				contains the user interface
