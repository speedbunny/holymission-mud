NAME
    possess - possess an object, a monster or a player

SYNOPSIS
    possess <object>
    return
    silence <possesse>
    silence off

AVAILABILITY
    Archwizard	command

DESCRIPTION
    possess connects the 'interactive soul' of the requesting wizard
    to the given object. the target object can be a player, a monster
    or any object present in the current room, by means of present().
    when possessing a player, the player need not to be present.
    if the target is a player, possess also sets the victim snooping
    the possessor, thus the victim is able to watch the possessors actions.
    it is also possible for the victim to communicate with the possessor,
    anything typed at the command line will be sent to the possessor.

    this communication feature can be stopped by the possessor by
    typing `silence <victim>' at the command line prompt, while
    `silence off' will enable the victim to communicate again.

    to leave a possessed object, the possessor types `return' at the
    command line prompt.

    the `technical process' of possessing an interactive can be describe
    by shifting the `interactive souls' of both, the possessor and the
    possesse. the possessor is connected the the possesse's object, while
    the possesse is connected to a clone of /sys/poss.c

BUGS
    Possessing monsters is currently very primitive. The only ability
    working is to walk around. No real interactions with the game and its
    inhabitants are possible.
    Possessing objects is not really usefull, unless the requesting wizards
    makes sure that the object does at least contain routines for the
    command modifier and the basic routines used in the `living' object.

    An arch may possess players of any level - including own and higher levels.
FILES
    /secure/master.c			valid_snoop() lives here, which needs
					to be tricked by /sys/poss.c

					valid_exec() lives here, too.

    /sys/poss.c				the target item which the victim
					is connected to. this is cloned,
					moved into the possessors inventory
					and also used to set the snoop hook.

    /sys/arch.c				contains the user interface and
					the routines to shift `interactive
					souls' by means of exec().
