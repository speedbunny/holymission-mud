Hi,

I'm one of them who like to build up a mud. We are on to program a 3.x Mudlib
on our university (a 2.4.x is running under the account 140.78.3.1 4242) in
Linz-Austria. Therefor we needed a 3.x LP-Parser and a ground Mudlib to build
on. This we find on the host (alcazar.cd.chalmers.se) in the form of the
CD-Parser and CD-Mudlib.

This is a documentation made out off the man-documentation of the CD-Mudlib
on chalmers-host. You have to have a LaTex text-compiler to get the right
document or almost a dvi-print-utility.
There are some typos in the documenation they will be corrected in a further
release.

To compile the .tex files to one (large) .dvi file you have only to compile
the 'docs.tex'-file the others (general.tex, efuns.tex, lfuns.tex) will be
included by this file. Therefor write (im you have an alias 'latex' to start
the latex-compiler):

latex docs

That's all.

Ciao Jug (JÅrgen Vigna) (my english is not the best sorry ...).
