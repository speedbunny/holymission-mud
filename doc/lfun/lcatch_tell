int lcatch_tell( string act, string msg, object who )

act:   action
msg:   message
who:   the object, who told me something

this functions now replaces the catch_tell. It can be used in a monster or a
room. it is much more handsome as the old catch_tell, because you do not need
to extract the name from the string anymore.

the function returns 0, if the message cannot be processes (eg. busy, idle...)
and not 0, if the argument can be processed.

example (arguments, that are passed):

  lcatch_tell( "tells you:", "Have you seen my swamp-turtle lately ?", OBJECT )
