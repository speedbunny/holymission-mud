SET&QUERY - poison.c

Usual defined LFUN's:

set_name(s),set_short(s),set_long(s),set_value(i),set_weight(i),set_alias(s),
set_alt_name(s),query_value(),query_weight() .

set_strength(i): This is the strength of the poison, i.e. how much energy is
                 lost when eating it (in fact, it is the amount of poison
                 added to the player).
                 Example: set_strength(7);
set_eating_mess(s): This is the message that is displayed to all the others,
                    prepended with the name of this player. It needs a space
                    and a \n.
                    Example: set_eating_mess(" enjoys a rotten apple.\n");
set_eater_mess(s): This is the message displayed on the screen of the player.
                   This needs a \n.
                   Example: set_eater_mess("Yrch! Poisoned!\n");
query_food(): This returns 1: this is a food, though it is a bad one.
