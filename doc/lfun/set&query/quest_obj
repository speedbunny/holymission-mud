SET&QUERY - quest_obj.c

Usual defined LFUN's:

set_weight(i),set_name(s),query_weight(),query_name().

set_short_hint(s): This is a short hint to the quest, a kind of title. I don't
                   yet know if a \n is necessary.
                   Example: set_short_hint("Duplicate an apple");
set_compulsory(i): This defines the quest as a quest that should be done to
                   become wizard. You have to do it if i=1, and a player can
                   do it if i=0, but not necessarily.
                   Example: set_compulsory(1);
set_hint(s): This defines a hint for the quest. This is what the player sees
             if he/she lists the quests. I don't know if a \n is necessary.
             Example: 
             set_hint("Duplicate the apple given to you by Taliesin.\n");
set_level(i): This sets the level of the quest, the difficulty. A hint about
              the difficulty can be given by using set_weight(i): the weight
              determines how difficult the quest really is.
              Example: set_level(5);
set_guild(i): Use this if the quest is for a specific guild. A list of guilds
              can be acquired by going to guild/master and typing 'dump'.
              Example: set_guild(6);
query_level(): This returns the level of the quest.
query_guild(): This returns the guild of the quest.
