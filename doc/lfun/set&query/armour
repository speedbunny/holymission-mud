SET&QUERY - armour.c

Usual defined LFUN's:
set_id(s), set_name(s), set_short(s), set_value(i), set_weight(i), 
set_alias(s), set_long(s), set_info(), query_value(), query_name(),
query_weight(), query_info().

set_ac(i): This sets the armourclass of the armour: how many hits it can stop
           from an attack. See the rules for the exact value you should put
           in here.
           Example: set_ac(1);
set_unwearable(): This makes the armour unwearable for players, but not for
                  monsters (if I am correctly).
                  Example: set_unwearable();
set_type(s): This sets the type of the armour. There are various types (see
             the rules) and multiple types can be used in one armour. A
             player is not allowed to wear two armours of the same type.
             Different types are seperated by a '/'. Both armour and armor
             can be used, and will both map on the same body-area.
             Example: set_type("armour/amulet");
set_size(i): This sets the size of the armour. It is only wearable for that
             size. When the size is set to 0, the armour can be worn by any
             size creature. This should not happen too often.
             Example: set_size(2);
set_read(str): This makes str the text that appears if you
               read the armour.
               Example: set_read("Original design by Mauer.\n");
set_arm_light(i): This sets the light level of the armour. It's the same as
                  set_light in the reset of the armour, but it's done using
                  a set function. Please use this function, as it updates an
                  internal variable, see query_arm_light().
                  Example: set_arm_light(-1)
query_arm_light(): This returns the current light level of the armour.
query_read(): This returns the string that's set by set_read.
query_unwearable(): Returns true if the armour is unwearable (made for a 
                    strange monster, or damaged).
query_worn(): Returns true if the armour is worn.
query_type(): Returns the first set type.
query_armour(): Returns 1.
query_size(): This returns the set size.
query_size_name(): This returns the name of the size, for example: 'tiny' for
                   an armour of size 1.
