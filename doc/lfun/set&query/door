SET&QUERY - door.c

set_dir(s): This sets the place of the door in the room.
            Example: set_dir("north");
set_code(s): This sets the code of the door. The door can only be opened if
             the code of the door is equal to the code of the key, or the
             code of the key is 'zap'.
               Example: set_code("jen");
set_type(s): This sets the type of the key, what material it is made of ect.
             Example: set_type("iron");
set_door(o): This is to tell this door where the partner door is.
             Example:
             northdoor=clone_object("obj/door");
             southdoor=clone_object("obj/door");
             northdoor->set_door(southdoor);
             southdoor->set_door(northdoor);
set_room(s): This sets the filename of the room the door has to be moved to.
             It also moves the door to that room. This function must be used
             to move the door, or one must use the set_all(s) function.
             Example: door1->set_room("players/cashimor/room/corridor");
set_closed(i): This sets if the door is closed or the door is opened. This
               function can only be called AFTER the doors have been moved to
               the specific rooms. If i is 1, then the door closes, else the
               door opens.
               Example: set_closed(1);
set_locked(i): This sets if a door is locked or unlocked. It works like the
               set_closed(i) function.
               Example: set_locked(1);
set_can_lock(i): This sets if a door can be locked. If i is 1, it can be
                 locked, if i is 0, it can't be.
                 Example: set_can_lock(1);
set_both_status(): This function calls all functions that have been set in this
                   door in the partner door, this isn't done by the above
                   mentioned functions. If you do not use this function, doors
                   will behave very strangely.
                   Example:
                   door->set_locked(1);
                   door->set_both_status();
set_door_long(s): This sets the text that appears on the screen when the door
                  is examined.
set_all(s): This function is used to set a lot of parameters at once, in one
            command. The values in s have to be seperated by spaces, and are:
            the file name of the room the door has to go to, the direction the
            door is in within the room, the type of the key, the code of the
            key, if the door is closed, if the door is locked and if the door
            can be locked. For a detailed explanation of all these things, see
            the function descriptions above. For this function it is not needed
            that the door is already in the room, it is even moved to the room
            specified. It does NOT call a set_both_status(), this should be
            done seperately.
            Example: set_all("players/cashimor/hall north iron jen 1 1 1");
set_auto_unlock(i): This function makes this door auto unlock. Only one door
                    of a pair may have this function! If this is set to a door,
                    it will unlock automatically when opened, like the front
                    door of a house. When closed from the other side, however,
                    it will automagically lock. This is useful for interesting
                    doors because they can be turned around: once inside you
                    can't get out again! i needs to unequal to 0 (preferably
                    1) to enable this feature for a door.
                    Example: door2->set_auto_unlock(1);
query_dir(): This function returns the direction the door is in.
query_locked(): This function returns 0 if the door is unlocked, and 1 if it
                is locked.
query_partner_door(): This returns an object pointer to the other side of the
                      door, the one in the room you come in when you go through
                      it.
query_room(): This returns the file name of the room the door should be in.
