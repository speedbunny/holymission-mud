TYPES

Variables can have one of the following types:

int:	An integer. Normally full 32 bits signed.

status:	A boolean, either 0 or 1 (same as int).

string:	A string (not pointer to string).

object: Pointer to an object.

asrray: Pointer to a vector of values. See LPC/arrays.

All uninitialized variables have the value 0. The type of a variable is really
only a documentation, and has no effect at all on the program !
A pointer to a destructed object, will always have the value 0.

Global variables in an object can have the type modifier 'static'. This means
that they will not be saved in save_object(), or destroyed when in
restore_object().
