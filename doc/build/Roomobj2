In your "driver" room (a real room which contains all the object rooms),
include "room.h". j Build this room normally, adding in a call to xreset();
in the reset() function.

(or, if you use "std.h", add the lines "#undef EXTRA_RESET", 
"#define EXTRA_RESET xreset();" right after including std.h)

to make a room, make a variable "object room1".  There are four macros for
rooms fright now, BUILD_ONE to BUILD_FOUR.  Here's the format for BUILD_TWO:

object room1;
xreset() {
  if (!room1) {
     BUILD_TWO(room1, "kitchen",
	 "$players/wizard/driver$basement", "down",
	 "players/wizard/outside", "south",
         "the kitchen",
	 "You are in ta big kitchen.\n", 1)
  }
}
