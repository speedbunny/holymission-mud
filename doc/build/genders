Genders
-------

Living objects that inherit /obj/living can now have a gender:
they can be male, female or neuter.

There is a variable, gender, which can have the values 0, 1 or 2,
#defined in /obj/living.h as NEUTER_GENDER (0), MALE_GENDER (1) and
FEMALE_GENDER (2).

These functions have been defined in /obj/living.c:

        query_gender() -- returns the value of the gender variable
        query_neuter() -- returns true if gender is neuter (0)
        query_male() -- returns true if gender is male (1)
        query_female() -- returns true if gender is female (2)

        set_gender(g) -- sets the gender variable to g (after checking)
        set_neuter() -- sets gender to neuter (0)
        set_male() -- sets gender to male (1)
        set_female() -- sets gender to female (2)

        query_gender_string() -- returns "neuter", "male" or "female"
        query_pronoun() -- returns "it", "he" or "she"
        query_possessive() -- returns "its", "his" or "her"
        query_objective() -- returns "it", "him" or "her"

The function show_stats(), used by the wizard command stat, has been
modified so it also displays the gender of the monster or player.

/obj/player.c has been modified to ask for a gender when a player
logs in for the first time, and to print "He is in good shape." etc.
I also changed the soul to print "Sabrina twiddles her thumbs." etc.

Monsters are neuter by default.
Old players will be asked at their next login.
