This is the file that explains how to make your rooms.
The easiest way to make new rooms is to use the roommaker, 
clone /obj/roommaker and then help room maker to get info
on it. For the little more advanced programmer it is 
recommended that you inherit "room/room". See the below
example (taken from /room/vill_green.c). Also read the
file /room/room.c for some more information on what the
different variables stands for.

inherit "room/room";


/* Always set the constant variables (yes, it sounds silly...)
 * in reset(), after the if(arg) return statement.
 */
reset(arg) {
    if (arg) return;

    set_light(1);
    short_desc = "Village green";
    no_castle_flag = 1;
    long_desc =
       "You are at an open green place south of the village church.\n" +
            "You can see a road further to the east.\n";
    dest_dir = ({"room/church", "north",
                 "room/hump", "west",
                 "room/vill_track", "east"});
    items = ({"church","It looks ancient",
              "road","It seems to lead into the village"});
}

query_inorout() { return 2; }

If you have any troubles making rooms then first ask a fellow wizard
and if he cannot answear your questions then ask an archwiz/high wiz.
If you want to add a monster then read the monster file and the 
monster.list file to see how it's done.
