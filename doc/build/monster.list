 Remember that players over level 5 has spells, give your
 highlevel monsters the same opportunity. Small monsters
 could use wimpy more often.

 If the monsters are given a spell the WC above could be
 reduced with the amount of spell_dam*chance/100 if desired.

 Don't have items/coins for more than approx HP*WC*AC/20 of
 value in your monsters.

 The alignment should lie between -1000 and +1000.

 Any major differing from these figures might be subject
 to archwizard inquieries.
