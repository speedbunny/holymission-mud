  In the last example (in /doc/Roomobj2), the parameters were:

BUILD_TWO(object_pointer, id_code, 
	 first_exit_room, first_exit_direction,
	 second_exit_room, second_exit_direction,
         short_desc, long_desc, light)

where: object_pointer: is the variable name of the object.
       id_code: is the string name of the room-object within the driver
	        room -- to get into a roomobj, you have to move_player
		to "$driver_path$id_code", where driver_path is the
		filename of your driver.
       first_exit_room: is the place to move_player if someone goes in
			the first_exit_direction direction.  If it is an
			external room, do it normally (as in std.h); if
			driven, then "$driver_path$dest_id_code" (dest_id_code
			is the destination's id code).
       short_desc and long_desc are self explanatory.
       light: is 0 for a dark room, 1 for a lit room.
