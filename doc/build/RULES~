This is the file /doc/build/RULES, containing rules for wizards on NannyMud.
It contains four "real" rules, numbered 1 through 4, and a set of guidelines,
with numbers from 5 and upwards.
The RULES must always be followed.
The GUIDELINES should probably always be followed, but they leave more room
for individual judgement. Think twice before breaking them. Things that would
cause a major change to the game and how it is played should at least be
discussed first!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rules:

Rule 1:	Do not harm a player directly!
	This  means, among other things, that you should never attack or
	kill a player. Also take care not to zap or teleport away (or heal)
	a monster a player is currently fighting (stat the monster first).
	Avoid teleporting a player without asking first.

Rule 2:	Do not help a player directly!
	This means, for example, that you must not help by killing or
	attacking monsters, healing players or giving away items (an
	occasional beer	might be excused). Also take care not to leave
	valuable items lying around, e. g. don't zap a monster and leave
	its weapon-containing corpse to rot on the street.

Rule 3: Do not make deadly traps!
	A player must never die because he didn't know what happens in the
	next room. If some room is very dangerous, make some hint (like the
	giant footprints outside the giant's lair).
	So don't make another Kantele's snake pit!

Rule 4:	Do not send killer-monsters out into the world!
	This means that	if you create a monster that can walk out of the
	castle, make it a nice monster (i. e. it should never attack players).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guidelines:

Number 5: Don't make too good things!
	For example, don't create weapons with weapon class > 20 if there is
	no big drawback with them. Weapons with wc 20 should be at least as
	hard to get as the swords of the three giants in the giant conference.
	  Also, body armour (type "armour") should be max armour class 4, and
	additional armour, like helmets, always class 1.
	  And don't make the monsters too easy to kill. A monster with much
	treasure and/or many experience points should be big, dangerous and
	hard to kill. Try to keep close to hp*wc*ac/20 for the total value
        of the monster's items and coins.
	  Remember that the purpose of the game is for it to be fun and
	enjoyable, both for players and for wizards - not to have all players
	converge on your castle just to get that wc 30 sword.

Number 6: Don't make healing too easily available!
	It's an important part of the game that players have to wait for their
	hit points to regenerate. Also, the pub is one of the main sources of
	player interaction and role playing.
	  Remember that even if you only heal a few points per player command
	(like "drink from fountain"), many players use macros and
	abbreviations and can still heal almost instantly.
	  Make the players drunk, the healing very limited, the cost very
	high, or the place very hard to get to! (4gc/hp or more)

Number 7: Don't build lots and lots of extra pubs and shops!
	The pub, as mentioned above, and also the shop, are natural meeting
	points and important sources of player interaction. Therefore you
	should try not to build your own pub or shop if you don't really need
	it (for example in a quest or for a guild).

Number 8: Don't generate messages that look like something they are not!
	As an example you should not try to fool the player that someone says
	something when it isn't true. The game can be hard and confusing enough
	without any additional confusion added on purpose.

Number 9: Don't clutter the /room areas!
	Avoid putting objects outside your castle. As we get more and more
	wizards, the basic rooms will soon be full enough just by the castle
	objects.

Number 10: Avoid making players loose experience points!
	Try to avoid making devices, situations etc. which makes the players
	loose experience if they are adventuring or examining objects. Players
	should be rewarded for adventuring and discovering things.
	(Being killed is a special case...)

Number 11. No test-players on the high-score list!
	If you have a "test" character, make sure that it isn't seen in the
	top score list, and also that it doesn't become wizard.

Number 12. This is a fantasy setting.
	This is primarily a fantasy setting and in the "long distant past".
	Other settings are allowed in separate worlds, accessed via "gates".
	The "gates" should restrict players of bringing in objects from the
	other world.
	I. e. A player shouldn't step right into a spaceport from the pub,
	get a laserrifle, and come back with it. (Idea: transform the rifle
	to a crossbow)

Number 13. Telporting should be restricted.
        Any item that lets players teleport should either teleport only to
        a fixed set of locations, OR it should use the "realm" mechanism:
            A room's realm is defined by the function realm() in that room.
            It should return a string, or 0 - the latter is equivalent to
            not having a realm() function in the room.
            Teleporting is not allowed between different realms,
            or from or to the realm "NT".
        Naturally, you can use this scheme to teleport-protect your own rooms.
        Even if your teleport item only teleports to some fixed locations,
        it is strongly recommended that it checks for the "NT" realm in the
        room that it teleports out of.

Number 14. Use your common sense and when this is not enough: ASK.
	The archwizards/ highwizards are there to help you.
