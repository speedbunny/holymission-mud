Deathtraps
==========

GENERAL
-------

You HAVE TO consider the following restrictions when building deathtraps:

1. There must be a clear hint to the deathtrap. This should be done in the
   short-desc of the room, so that you can see it with the "exits"-command.
   In very rare cases the hint can be given in the long-desc of the room,
   but this you have to tell to the wizard approving your area and get his/her
   ok that you may do it.
2. Do not misuse deathtrap. Deathtraps should be very rare. This for the
   following reasons:
      - No player likes to run into a DT every minute
      - If there a lot of DTs, players will search in every room, so they will
        find every DT. That is, of course, senseless too.

When you code a DT, you always must tell this the wizard who approves your
area. If you implement a DT when your area is already approved, tell it to
a higher ranking wizard and get his ok !


HOW TO CODE ONE
---------------

Coding of the room will stay the same as you are used to code one by now.
The only difference is, that you will have to include "/room/deathtrap"
instead of "/room/room".

In the reset of the room the following functions must be overridden:

   - set_time_to_trigger( int time )
     this function will set the time, when the DT should trigger. time is
     the amount in seconds, therefor an amout of 0 means instant.
   - set_dt_msg( string msg )
     the message, the player will get, when the death-trap triggers.

example:

------------ start example ---------------

// this example is not compileable !
// it will create a DT, which will trigger after 8 seconds, displaying the
// player the string "Suddenly the ceiling ...."

inherit "/room/deathtrap";

void reset( int tick )
{
   // do stuff here needed every reset

  if ( tick > 0 )  return;              // exit if it is not the initial tick

  // do stuff here needed only at the initial tick
  // e.g. giving the short/long/items/exits ....

  set_time_to_trigger( 8 );
  set_dt_msg( "Suddenly the ceiling collapses and buries you ...\n" );
}

------------ end example -------------------
