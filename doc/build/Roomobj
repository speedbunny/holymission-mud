  the /doc/Roomobj* files describe the new format for creating rooms.  This 
has only been tested for the simplest of rooms, like the /room/forest/forest1
type which used to be a fve line file including "std.h".
  Now, however, in order to save disk space, we will put many rooms into one
file by treating the rooms as if they were objects.
  The files /doc/Roomobj2 and /doc/Roomobj3 describe the procedures further.
Ask Wizard/Merle if you have further questions about it.
