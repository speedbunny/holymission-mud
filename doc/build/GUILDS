If you are a wizard and want to make a guild of your own, then you
should do this:

Copy the file /room/adv_guild.c, and make your own titles. It is 
important that your new guild has the same costs for advancement.
This is done by the call "room/adv_guild"->query_cost_for_level(l, e),
where 'l' is the current level of the player, and 'e' is the current
experience of the player. This function should return the cost in 
gold to advance for that player. Put this function call in
cost_for_level().

Why this extra call ? Because the file room/tune.h might get changed,
and the adv_guild.c reloaded with new costs. The cost to advance must
be the same in all guilds, as it should not be used for competition.

Don't forget to remove the lines for cloning of bboard, orc_slayer-quest
and the book in extra_reset().

Next step is to make an autoload object, that players will carry that
shows that they are a member of your guild. The object does not have
to be visible to the player, but it must have an id == "guild_mark".
You must also check that the player is not member of another guild,
by the call: present("guild_mark",this_player()).
It can happen that a player can lose his autoload object.

It is a requirement that all guilds must document all their features
in /open/GUILD_xxx, so that all wizards can see what they do. Not how
the features are implemented, but what features are implemented.

A normal thing with guilds are that they give some nice feature to the
player, like special "emotes", extra spells, and other fancy things.

It must be possible to leave the guild.

Players in your guild must also solve all quests.

Before you open your guild, you must document your guild, and then the
god or an archwizard must approve it.

*** Because HM is already full with guilds, no new guilds will
    currently be allowed! ***
