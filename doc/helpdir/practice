command:  practice [spell/ability] or
          prac [spell/ability]
argument: the spell or ability you want to practice or learn

By simply typing "practice" or "prac" you will be informed of the spells and
abilities you have at the moment. Also listed are the knowledge of the spells
and the time it takes to perform them.

When you type practice at someone who can teach you spells or abilities, you
will increase your knowledge of them. If you do not know the ability or spell
already you will learn it.

Of course you only can do this if you have practice sessions remaining.
You can get practice sessions by gaining levels at your guild. How much you 
will get depends on which guild you belong to.
