command: group
argument: player name or none

This command is used to build groups(=parties/teams).
To build a group one player has to be the leader of the group. All others
have to follow the leader. 
The leader is then able to add players to his group (DON'T FORGET YOURSELF!!).
To add a player just type 'group <player name>'. If you want to kick a 
player out of the group again, just group it again.

Every group member is able to see a list of the members by typing 'group'
without argument.

The sense of a group is that the XP for killing a monster will be shared
with all group members in the room when the monster dies.

The leader can only group people within 5 levels of him/herself.

See also 'follow, rid'.
