command: wimpy
argument: percent or 'brave'

Toggles wimpy mode. If you are in wimpy mode, your legs will run away
if your hit points go below the value given in percents of your max.

Possible values are from -1 (brave) to a max-value depending on your abilities.

Default for a new player is brave mode.

This is no secure thing. It might save you if you have a slow connection
or slow fingers. Some monsters hack away more than the above value of your HP, 
and you might find yourself dead without warning. And some monsters can
follow you as well.
