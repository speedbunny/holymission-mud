WIZZING:

The wizzing system on Holy Mission has returned to the original
mentor system but with a few changes.  Wizzing is not a social
event; those who are not interested in expanding the MUD should
consider remaining a player.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Level 29, 5,000,000 xp, 85% quest rating, and mentor approval.
2. Must have completed a minimum of 12 days of play time.
3. Mentor must be [Wiz], [Sage], [Retd], [Elder] or [Arch]

PROCEDURE:

1. Find a mentor, ask him for the mentor quest and he will assign it to you.
2. Go to your guild hall and advance to wizard there.
3. At [Appr] level you will be asked to read the /doc files and understand them.
4. After roughly one week have your mentor ask an archwizard
   to test you.
5. [New] wizards are expected to code an area.
