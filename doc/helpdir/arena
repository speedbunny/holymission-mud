The arena has been closed. Too many players enter it then
quit the game or go link dead for the
sole purpose of messing it up. Abuse will not
be tolerated.

The arena is a place where player killing is generally allowed. 
The arena is opened from time to time for certain levels. If you are in
the allowed range, you may enter the arena. This is done by simply typing
'arena enter'. If you want to check if the arena is open right now and
who may enter it, simply type 'arena'.
Once you type 'arena enter' and are allowed to enter it, you will be moved
to a preparation room. In this room you are not allowed to fight and you may
prepare yourself for the combat. You are fully healed when you enter this
room. When you are done with the preparations, you may enter the arena.
In the arena the pk rule is negotiated. You may kill whomever you like, be it
a player or a testplayer of a god. Anything which is legal in the mud is
legal in the arena too. You may use items, special guild powers or spells,
just as you like. The only goal in the arena is to survive. The slaughter will
continue until there is only one left. This one is declared the winner of
the fight and receives an entry in the list of champions.
If you die in the arena, you will lose neither experience nor levels. You are
simply moved to the church and will be fully healed. Of course, items you
drop in the fight will be lost to you.

Occasionally someone might actually be killed in the arena. This should
not happen but might in rare occurances. Therefore playing is at own risk.
