ABOUT:

Legends are players, who already settled the requirements to become wizards,
but decided to play on. The Legend-System is fully implemented to the mud-lib.
Death and raising of stats will be handled correct (at least, i hope it will).

REQUIREMENTS:

The player must have 80% of all possible quest-exp and must have the exp to
become wizard (at the moment 3.000.000 [120295]).

SUGGESTED BENEFITS:

The player should gain more hit-points and spell-points and special abilities
with legend-levels. Also it is possible to raise his stats over the limit of
his/her race-restrictions.

INCREASING LEGEND-LEVELS:

Increasing legend-levels just the same as increasing normal levels. There is
a table showing the required experience for a legend-level.

NEW FUNCTIONS DEALING WITH LEGEND-LEVELS:

/sys/player.c

   - void set_legend_level( int ll )
           set the legend-level of a player (must be level 29 alrady)
   - int query_legend_level( void )
           returns the legend-level of a player

   NOTE: these functions should not be accessed by anything other than the
         guild_master/guild_room !!! Do NOT mess around with them

   other functions where changed in the player too to implement this system
   (query_exp_next_level() and function calling this function ...)

/guild/room.c

   The advancing of the player is handled there. The advaning of legend-levels
   or becoming a legend is already handled in this room. You do not need to
   code your own legends anymore.

/guild/master.c

   - varargs int query_maxsp( int lvl, int leg_lvl )
          returns the maxsp of a player. lvl = level, leg_lvl = legend-level
          the sec. parameter is new to this function

   - varargs int query_maxhp( int lvl, int leg_lvl )
          synonym to the above function.

   NOTE: these two functions can be redefined in your guild-room !

   - void list_legend_levels( int gd, int gen )
          shows a list with the exp needed for each legend-level (similar to
          list_levels(), which you know from the "help levels" command)
          gd = number of the guild, gen = gender (ignored at the moment)

   - varargs string query_pretitle( int gd, int lvl, int gen, int leg_lvl )
          returns the pretitle for the level lvl.
          gd = guild-number, lvl = level, gen = gender, leg_lvl = legend-level
          at the moment the pretitle for legends is: "NameOfGuild-legend"
          this is subject to change in the future !!!


HOW TO IMPLEMENT LEGENDS TO YOU GUILD:

quite easy!

you just have to recode the query_maxhp() and query_maxsp() in your guildroom,
concerning the new second argument legend-level.

then think about some abilities, your legends should have (depending on legend-
level, of course), code them and implement them to your soul.

that's all

have fun with it and i hope it will work

pat

PS: some functions are still subject to change, but i am quite sure that the
    function-call will remain the same. there will be additions to this system,
    like pretitles and gender-support, but give me some time.
