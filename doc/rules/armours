Now under which conditions can you use max ac when the normal ac is lower ?

The best way is use them as artifacts, when the monster is very tough to 
slay. I would say level > 50 should be standard for such a monster.
Make them then very expensive , unless the player can store them easily.


The Price ?

Hmm, its often not so easy, so there is a hint what such an item can 
cost in the Price/Unit. 


What to do when the Item has a very high ac ?

When the ac of an item is very high, just add so min 10000 coins to its
value, the same is when the items would have some special actions...
This is because such items shall be extremly expensive to rent.


What to do when the Item has a extremly high ac ?

When the ac of an item is very high, just add so min 30000 coins to its
value, the same is when the items would have some special actions...
This is because such items shall be extremly expensive to rent.


Example: (we think about the value of an armour)

  Ac 1-2 is cheap ware we can take a very low value.
  Ac 3 would be a lower ac so we take 1/2 value 500 coins
  Ac 4 would be normal so the unit is so 1000 coins.
  Ac 5 would be a very high ac then so we add min 10000 coins.
  Ac 6 would be a extremly high ac then so we add min 30000 coins.



The weight:

    0 ==  nearly no weight as earrings, rings or stickers for example 
    1 ==  a bit weight as necklace belt or bracelet...
    2 ==  some weight as arm leg boots helmet .....
    3 ==  a bit heavy as shield, leather armour, chainmails 
    4 ==  very heavy as big iron shields, platemails
    5 =   extremly heavy as fullplates 


Armour combinations:

     A typical armour combination is a fullplate with leg and armpart.

     So we can do set_type("/armour/arm/leg");

     What means we should calculate the value and weight of all those
     types and just add them :*) 


Famous last words:

    True there can be reasons why this or that value is a bit cheaper,
    or maybe why the weight is a bit lower. But this should be good
    and fair reasons then......
    A good hint is before you start to code a very strong armour,
    think which chain reactions in other wizes code this may cause.
    Please think carefully on any step you do, as dont give a level
    20 orc for example an ac 4 chainmail. Give them maybe an ac 2
    leather jacket or something like that. Here again a list of 
    monster levels:

    Level 1-10: Junk stuff, junk armours junk weapons. Maybe a jacket
                with ac 1 or so.

    Level 10-20: Bad stuff, bad armour bad weapons. Maybe a shield with
                 ac 1.

    Level 20-40: Normal stuff, normal armours. Maybe a chainmail ac 3.

    Level 40-60: Good stuff maybe a platemail ac 4.

    Level 60-80: Very good stuff, maybe a shield ac 4. 

    Level > 80: All kinds of great stuff, but not too much of it.
    
               

    After all, this note shall only be a path through a jungle of 
    different armours. We know that there might be many other to
    stray from this path. As master objects quest objects ect...
    But please think carefully, because stong failures can force
    restrictions, what we all don't want. And please don't orientate
    youself on old crap. There will be many of them recoded.
