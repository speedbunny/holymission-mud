We define a wiztool as: something which can be used to perform patches or
			commands on living or non-living items.

Such items may not be used by level 120 wizards, and it is now ILLEGAL for
any wizard to produce an item which may be used in this way by wizards of
level less than 140 without obtaining the permission of an arch or god.
Further permission must also be obtained, from the same people, for any
modifications in any of the abilities of such an item.

IF YOU HAVE ANY WIZTOOLS IN YOUR DIRECTORY THIS WILL AFFECT YOU.
LONG-TERM POSSESSION AND/OR USE OF ILLEGAL WIZTOOLS WILL RESULT
IN DEMOTION, OR, IN CASES OF REPEATED OFFENCES, BANISHMENT. ABUSE
OF WIZTOOLS (YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS) WILL RESULT IN BANISHMENT.

All legal wiztools must have a copy in /tools. Any tool that doesn't
is considered illegal. Check this file for a list of LEGAL wiztools.

Legal wiztools:

For all wiz levels:
    Stack-pointer (open)
    Board Boots
    Display
     Mistletoe
    Wizrock       (Arthur)
    Personal Librarian

Permitted for level 140 and above:
    Object tracer
    Wand of Wizards
    Dynion
    Boa

NOTE: JUST BECAUSE A WIZTOOL IS PERMITTED DOES *NOT* MEAN THAT YOU
      CAN USE ALL OF IT'S FUNCTIONS. THERE ARE MANY FUNCTIONS ON
      WIZTOOLS THAT CAN BE ABUSED. IF IN DOUBT, DON'T DO IT!

As a general rule of thumb, any function that you cannot perform yourself by
using a wizard command, is illegal. Please stick to this rule of common sense.
For levels below 160 these commonly used wiztools are now ILLEGAL:

    Broom (Lila)
    Stack (Lila/Calidor/Macbeth)

If a wiztool is not mentioned here, it means it has not yet been
checked by a responsible archwizard or God, and is not permitted.

For clarification: Please contact an archwizard or god (or mail).
Due to the abuse of wizard tools, rules are being tightened up on the use of
such items.

  If you wish to code a tool or something special check with an Arch or God
or else you will be held responsible. 

  Thank You
