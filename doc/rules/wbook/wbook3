         PLAYER INTERACTION

Wizard and Player interaction is commonplace.
However, do not give anything to players without
a VERY good reason.  (such as player has the
trollslayer and loses it due to a bug)
Any circumstances like this should be 
documented on the wiz sheriff board so
an ARCH or Elder can fix the bug.
