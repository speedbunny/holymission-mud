SECRETXP - version 2.0 - rules and guidelines.

Introduction

Now there is a new easy way of giving XP to players, apart from making 
monsters. This way is the secretxp-method. Although this method is easy for 
the wizards, it should by no means be easy for the players! The secretxp 
routines were made for players who want to earn XP for other things than 
fighting: exploring, searching, solving riddles, ect.

What is secretxp?

secretxp.h is an include file which you can use when you want to give XP to
players who do something special. A routine using secretxp should be in a
directory belonging to a wizard (any directory). The includefile defines two
functions: the primary function 'secret_xp()' and the macro 'lw()' which is
defined by including "/obj/lw.h". For an explanation of the function 'lw()',
see /doc/lfun/include. 

Usage of secret_xp.

int secret_xp([amount][,text][,target]);
int amount;
string text;
object target;

All arguments are optional, and the return value isn't very important. amount
will default to the maximum value: 1000 XP times the level of target, text will
default to a text that you have discovered something new and get XP and the
target will default to this_player(). There are four possible return values:
0: success, 1: target was an NPC, 2: the instruction was not invoked from a
/players/ directory, 3: the player had already gotten secretXP from the current
wizard.

Guidelines/rules:

* A secret_xp can only be given once by a certain wizard to a certain player.
  You needn't check for this: the secret_xp() routine does all the checks. If
  you have two different objects which both add secret_xp(), only the first one
  used by the player will give the xp.

* There may not be monsters of a level higher than five between the church and
  the place of secretxp: it's made for intelligence, not strength. Monsters 
  that can be circumvented by intelligence are allowed, though.

* Not all players should be able to enter secretxp the same way. There MUST be
  a distinction, and there must be AT LEAST two ways to get there. So it should
  make the route different depending on race, sex or guild, or another
  interesting parameter (not level or experience!).

* The things that use secretxp should NOT be part of a quest.

* It should take intelligence to get to the secretxp.

* New Wizards are NOT allowed to make use of the secretxp include file. Any
  use of this file may involve banishment.

* It is not allowed to give secretxp items to players, or trans them into rooms
  that use it, or ect... You understand it.

More guidelines can follow, so check this file and the boards regularly! If you
want to use this at the moment, it's wise to discuss it with Ethereal Cashimor
first. The file may be buggy at this time.
