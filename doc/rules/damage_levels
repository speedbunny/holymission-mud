A limit on the amount of damage was imposed with 800 being
the maximum any one hit can do. There is an exception rule, but
all exceptions have to go through Mangla.

If any spell in guilds is found to have the exception and
it not have been certified, that wizard will be demoted with
no questions asked.

Current exceptions:
Jedi - brainstorm
Thief - Backstab
