INFLICTING DAMAGE UPON A PLAYER/MONSTER

The only legal ways of infliction damage are:

1. in a spell of the spell directory:   hit_by_spell()
2. in an ability of the abilities dir:  hit_by_ability()
3. in a wapon with the weapon-hit-func: hit() (damage is the return-value)
4. misc damage (this is eg. when falling down a tree or hit by an avalance):
                                        misc_hit(int dam, int kind, mixed elem)

You must have a very good reason to inflict damage of kind 4. And it must be
logical! Normally deathtraps are suited better for this purpose.
NO PLAYER MUST INFLICT DAMAGE UPON AN OTHER PLAYER WIH misc_hit() !!!!
ABUSEMENT OF misc_hit() WILL BE PUNISHED !
Normally only rooms should do so.

All other kinds are illegal !!!
