A word or two about coding player-specific thingies, or locations.
THIS IS NOT ALLOWED!
The only exception to this, is that you are allowed to test for your own name,
but ONLY your own name! Also, it is not allowed to test for ip addresses,
or any other outside-world test anyone might think up.
So:

DONT TEST FOR SPECIFIC PLAYERS!
