Rules on drinks in pubs:

Max strength permitted = 36;

Healing <= strength^2 / 20 + strength * (3/2) - 4
Cost    >= strength^2 * (2/3)

Cost for reducing intoxication: 25 gold points per point.

Rules on food and soft drinks in pubs:

Max strength permitted = 50;

Healing <= strength * 2
Cost    >= strength * 13

For portable healing, healing should be reduced by at least 25%,
and cost should be increased by at least 25%.

You are not permitted to sell portable items which reduce intoxication
or any items which heal players without adding intoxication, or stuffing
or soaking the player.

You _are_ permitted to have portable items which heal without intoxicating
or being food or soft drinks, but they must be approved by an Archwizard
and be documented, and must only be able to be got by a player by either
killing a lot of monsters or solving some kind of mini-quest.

All purchasable portable healing must have a weight of at least
(hp of healing / 200).
