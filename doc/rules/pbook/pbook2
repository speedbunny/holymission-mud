         PLAYER KILLING

Player Killing is legal in certain circumstances.
You are allowed to PK in self defense, or in 
retaliation for being robbed.  If a PK settles a 
dispute it is allowable.

Serial Player Killing is illegal and is grounds for
instant banishment.  If you PK you had better have
a GOOD reason.

ALL PKs are subject to wizard ruling
