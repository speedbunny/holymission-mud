         MULTIPLE PLAYERS

Players are allowed to have 2 characters.
However, only one may be logged in at any one time,
and the 2 should never interact or help the other.

If this is broken or you have more than 2 characters,
you risk banishment of any number of your characters,
up to and including ALL of them.
