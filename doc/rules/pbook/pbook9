         HARASSMENT

Please respect people's privacy on the game. Do not bother people that
do not want to be bothered. We should all be adults, or try to act
like one, so if someone asks you to leave them alone, please do so.
Harassment will not be tolerated.

If you are being harassed, please take the following steps:
  1.  Clearly ask the offender to stop, and then ignore them.
      Without an audience, most people who are trying to harass
      simply stop. Those that weren't intending to will stop.
  2.  Contact a wizard who will assess the situation and perhaps 
      stop the offender from using tell and shout.
  3.  If no wizard is available, and you feel the harassment is
      interfering with your ability to enjoy yourself, quit. No
      reason to force undue stress upon yourself, just return at
      another time when the offender might not be around or a wizard
      might be able to help you.
