A few things about names of items.

1) The name of an item should describe it, and not mean anything else than
   what it is (i.e. no cloaks that are named chest for example).

2) Items may not be named by players (because then things could be named
   other than they are).

Reasons:

Some quests check on the id (i.e. the name) of an item.
Water.c checks if something called 'allows_breathing' is present.
torch.c uses the 'lighted_torch' name to notify that it's lighted.
And everywhere else where 'present' is preferred above checking the entire
inventory of a character.
