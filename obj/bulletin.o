tmp_text "fatigue - points are used for the new ability-system. if you do not have\nany special abilities in your guild by now, do not worry about them, they\nwill not influence you.\n\nif you are in a guild with special abilities, the fatigue - points will\ndetermine, how \"tired\" you will get when using a certain special ability.\ne.g. the usage of karate at the ninjas will cost you a certain amount of\nthese fatigue-points. type \"help ability karate\" to see the amount.\n\npat\n\n**\nhi,\n\nsince we are having memory problems, expect crashes every 6 hours.\ni am working on getting this fixed.\n\n/herp\n*\n\n\n**\n\nPlease goto the mentor board and read\nthe note i have posted there. thank\nyou\n\nApollo\n\n\n**\num... isn't that what spell point's are for???\n\nwhen did this become a diku Mud??  (why would you WANT it to???)\n\nack!\n\n**\nTry man fatigue_points   they are not movement points\nand are not used for movement as a standard\ndiku mud.  they are used for abilities. Therefor they will\nact sort of like more SP.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\n\nAs many of you have heard, there is a government bill going through\nthat would put a LOT of censorship on internet.  There is a petition\nout to let them know we disagree...\n\nsimply email to:\n\nS314-petition@netcom.com\n\nand the message should include:\n\nSIGNED (your email address) (your name) (u.s. citizen (y/n))\n\nexample:\n\nSIGNED s_cphite@vaxa.clarion.EDU  Craig P. Hite  YES\n\nInclude ONLY this in the letter... If you need more info, email me\nat S_CPHITE@VAXA.CLARION.EDU and I'll send you it.\n\nLater!\nWilbie\n\n**\nLiberal-Fascist-communist????  shows how uniformed you are...\nLiberal and communist go together, but fascist??? Mussoline and Hitler were\nNO liberals, let me tell you...\n\nSecond...socialism works...we are just too stupid and blind to see it...\nGermany and the rest of Europe have adopted it, and sure, it has its\nflaws, but it is better than seeing our children starving while we give tax\nbreaks to the people who have all the money...\n\nAnd even if all this were untrue...You think Bill Clinton is LIBERAL??????\nIn Europe, or basically any country in the world besides this one, and \nmaybe Canada, Clinton would be considered Conservative...and OUR conservatives\nwould be close to Neo-Fascists...\n\nNow...you may argue with my \"world view\", which is certainly more informed\nthan yours, even if I do make mistakes...but about this fact there is NO\ndoubt...Interviews with Mitterand and Kohl have proven this fact...\nAlong with Richard Weizsaecker...who doesn't know why we are so down on\na conservative for being liberal..to him it makes no sense...\n\nH.\n\n**\nHello, anyone seen Glue around here. Tell her that she should leave a message here for me,\nThank you, ENDOLAS.\n\n**\nLet's create a political board ... cause this is ADVENTURERS' and GUILD board.\n\nThormy... :)\n\n**\nWhat do you mean by involvement?  Where you hindered by a wiz\nin your pk'ing?  If so then please let other know so\nthat we may attempt to prevent this in the future. If you\nare refering to the wizzes sitting there and watching you\npk kol and commenting then how is the involoved? that is\njust an audience which I would think would be appreciated that\nyou could attract that much attention.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nKol brought on a friends character and spoke through him complaining \nabout my killing of him.  He thought that there was a wiz helping me\nhe tried, and failed to prove this.  I understand his consern of my\ncheating, but I did not and will never receive any help during a kill.\nHe just did not know how good I really was.  But back to the issue.\nHe brought in a wizard in an attempt to get me in trouble to killing him.\nI thought that player killings were spose to be done by the player, and \nfaught for by the player, and reasoned by the player.\nIf there is not suppose to be and wizard involvement in these killings\nThen there shouldn't be.  If there could be some way to show that wiz's\neither help or don't help players, this could be a good idea\njust so that people won't continue to think this.  Maybe loging\ntransfering players would help, if this would be possible.\nI already know that the healing of players is logged so we can show that\nI was not healed by a wiz, and the same with my healing rate...same as normal\nunlike I was accused of.  This is going to be a long battle to\nstraighten out the killing of players, But is long worth the work.\nThanks for listening.\nDEMO\n\n**\n  Socialism is the first step to Communism!!!\n\n   And communism works in only two places \n       1) Hell where the already have it,\n          2)And heaven where they don't need it!\n\n    This is a quote from a famous american wonder if anyone knows who it is?\n\n      Haplo\n\n\n**\nOk, now I keep getting \"talked to\" by wizzes about my player killings.\nthey try to keep me from doing it, or killing certain people.\nIf pk is legal, why is everyone yelling at me for doing it\nor should i say \"talking to\" me about it, when all they do is\ntry and stop me from killing people, and especially their friends\nIt's your choice wizzes, if it's legal for me to kill, ACT LIKE IT.\nThanks\nDEMO\n\n**\nI agree with Demo (and hope I am not on his \"next\" list)\nOne of the stipulations in \"help playerkilling\" is for no wiz\ninvolvement.  Please back up your words with actions\nand leave Demo alone.  Thanks.\n\n\nMango (only killed one player so far, so there)\n\n**\nit is legal to kill players, ok\nit is also legal to talk with you about it\nso don't complain\n/Muzmuz\n\n**\nsocialism is what differs us from animals\n/Muzmuz\n\n**\n\n No, intelligence, reasoning, and concern for our fellow human beings\n is what seperates us from animals.  Socialism is just a way to put a leash\n on people and control them (like animals).  \n\nWilbie \n\n**\nNo, Wilbie, ego seperates us from animals... Only humans\nactually believe that they are superior in intellegence, reasoning, etc...\n\n**\na player does not need to justify him/herself for a pk.\ni would call bothering a player because of pks is interference too.\nso, wizzes, please stop this. nobody forces a player to become pk and\nit is the sole decision of the player. and i think, everybody\nknows, that when you are a pk you may become pked too.\n\nbtw: i would consider healing or transing a player while in a pk-combat\n    a reason for demotion. if any player can prove such wizard-interference,\n    tell an arch about it or mail me.\n\npat\n\n**\nSamurai guild has been taken off line for major recoding.\nThe original code is just breaking down, Sauron and Haplo have\ntaken over responsiblity for the guild.  It will reopen ASAP.\nold members will be invited back gratis.\n\nTatsuo, Guild Coordinator\n\n**\n\nPK stands for fun ... what's the fun in killing the same char thousands\nof times.\n\nIf I had a PK license I wouldn't enjoy such an act... \n\nThorm\n\nPS. And by the way...Demolian. Nobody asked me to tell you my oppinion.\nNobody can force me to say something I don't want to...so You heard\nMY oppinion and not Players'. \nTo all PKers : kill,kill,kill but don't make the MUD less enjoyable for\nplayers with PK license.\n\n**\nagain about pk.\nI do it for fun usually, and I do usually enjoy it\nbut when a player comes along, and can't handle the kill\nand continual comes after me, i have to take care of him\nso that my life is not in danger.\nI'm not going to have some lunatic chasing after me\nas for thorm telling me his opinion, who says i wanted to hear it???\npk'ers know what they have to fear.\nlet them do what they need to in order to survive (if possible)\nbtw, as everyone knows, i'm not going to be pk'ing much\nfrom now on anyways, so there isn't much to fight about...\nThanks,\nD\n\n**\nBy getting a PK licence you know what you're letting yourself in for - means\nthat you can be killed as well as kill. Personally if a registered PKer gets\nPKed, why should anyone really give a damn? They presumably only registered\nso they could do just that to other players.\n\nDazza\n\n**\nmonk-skills have been removed for NON-monks finally!\n\n**\nI though the whole idea for getting PK is to stop characters annoying you.\nI didnt think it was a reason for having a PK liscence, or in my instance\nbecause I wanted to wiz and just because Demolian hates wiz's he feels he is\ngoing to kill me so ever i cant become one or just because he hates them\nAnd at this rate Ill never become a wiz because no one will be my mentor!\n\nLinsolent\n\nP.S I dont mind if i get Pk'd its a part of having the liscence but it\nwould be great if i ever do get PK'd there is a reasonable thing that lead to\nmy PKing not some half-wit excuse!\n\n**\nLinsolent - PK is not to stop chars from annoying you.\nIf they don't have aPK licence, even if they annoy you, you can't\nPK them. The whole point of the current PK system is that you get\nto decide whether or not you want to be a PKer and therefore open to\nbeing PKed, rather than having PK inflicted upon you if you don't want\nto or being totally barred from it if you do. \n\nDazza\n\nPS: I'm stilll working on the area!\n\n**\n\nMuzmuz as I understand it can be anyu level he wants anyway.\nSo I assume it's not a REAL demotion anyway\n\nDazza\n\n**\nhi all,\njust thought i'd tell you that kol was given exp and yes, i know this\nyesterday he was 18th level w/ approx 1 million exp.\nnow he's 6th legend level with approx 22 million exp\ni would like to know how and why this happened!!\nthis is outright cheating at it's worst, i have over 100 millions\nyet i never had to be patched.\nplease look into this.\nThanks\nDEMO\n\n**\n"
