The items in the dir /obj/generic are ready for use.
This opposed to the items in /obj which are usually configurable or are
there for history reasons (rope etc.).
If you see the item you need in this dir, just clone it directly from here.
Don't copy it, don't code it yourself, that saves trouble and memory usage.
If you don't find it here, try cloning an item from /obj and configure it.
