Important files in this directory:

WIZLIST    \
WIZSAVE.o --- I think we have all learnt just how important these are now.
WIZSCAN.o  /

login.c - Kinda hard to login without it. ;)

master.c - Kinda hard to run the mud without it. :)

simul_efun.c - Ditto (except see below).

simul_efun_spare.c - This file will be used by the master object if the   
                     main simul_efun.c file doesn't load for whatever
                     reason.

valid.c - Inherited by /sys/player.c - Holds the valid_read/write funs.
