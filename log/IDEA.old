how about changing the description through here to not be that same for all rooms. The path from here does not lead back near a garden it just leads back east.
Mangla Sat Feb 22 16:02:34 1997:
maybe describe teh trees a little bit more in the main desc.

Mangla Sat Feb 22 16:49:27 1997:
From one room to the next I had forgotten about the tree stump, Need to maybe rearrange these descs to make it stand out a little bit more or mention the stump in this room.

if you are going to change the look for the elf, why not include that it is feeling sick too to follow the same sort of lines that other monsters give?

Kryll Tue Jun 10 14:05:09 1997:
why is there nothing up here? shouldn't there be something perhaps?
Kryll Tue Jun 10 14:13:55 1997:
add an option for "dirt" in the dig function
Kryll Tue Jun 10 14:19:28 1997:
question: If the prairie is to the east and the woods is to the west and you can still travel north on this "road", then when is this mountain?
Kryll Tue Jun 10 14:21:52 1997:
maybe in the stream desc you could mention about how inviting it is as opposed to how deep and fast it is, since i had no idea i could swim here
Kryll Tue Jun 10 14:30:24 1997:
instead of all the printed messages, you may want to consider a few quick call_outs
Kryll Tue Jun 10 14:41:42 1997:
maybe add an integer that you can set every reset to be like num = 1 + random(5) and then clone that many gophers instead of only 1
Kryll Tue Jun 10 15:05:58 1997:
maybe increase the wc of the horns to 10 or so
Kryll Tue Jun 10 15:26:41 1997:

Kryll Tue Jun 10 15:30:52 1997:

Kryll Tue Jun 10 15:36:43 1997:
change the down add_action to overwriting the move function
Kryll Tue Jun 10 15:46:00 1997:
maybe have in the monster a set_monster_died thing that says that his ghost sinks into the floor...and now that you notice it does seem kind of strange...then in the search just make sure the mystic is not here...also make sure he cannot be feared
Kryll Tue Jun 10 16:05:29 1997:
where were you expecting the player to get the oil from?
Kryll Tue Jun 10 16:11:07 1997:
can you add one more sentence to the desc of husky
Kryll Tue Jun 10 16:39:42 1997:
make an object variable inside the sword to store who wields it...that way you can easily check my_wielder->query_alignment() ... that way don't need anoher call
Kryll Tue Jun 10 18:07:51 1997:
the only other comment would be that in the evil side perhaps the cats in the rooms should prevent players from going any further to the prince
Kryll Tue Jun 10 18:09:41 1997:
maybe have the hag prevent moving north
Emerald Sat Jun 14 00:58:11 1997:
can one not go back north to the treeline?
Mishikal Sat Jun 14 10:48:52 1997:

it would REALLY be good to have a mountain desc if you want the players to search it
Kryll Mon Jun 16 16:43:17 1997:
instead of basing it off the player's real name, base it off his size...makes modifying the hole more realistic
Soulsong Thu Jun 19 23:47:16 1997:
make it so you can examine the rack
Uglymouth Wed Jun 25 22:44:38 1997:

you might want to change the room desc so that it is not assumed that the idol mob is present - if someone comes here after it's been killed, then the desc doesn't make much sense.  you could try something like there is an engraven idol in the wall, and a slot carved out on the ground where it would norally stand
Emerald Tue Jul 15 19:58:45 1997:
if there are 2 exits from the room, don't say that the only exit is down
Emerald Tue Jul 15 20:01:41 1997:

Emerald Tue Jul 15 20:02:58 1997:
shouldn't you set the ep a bit higher than 50 for this pit demon?
Emerald Tue Jul 15 20:04:10 1997:
add a smell
Emerald Wed Jul 16 02:20:30 1997:
did you mean to set_ep on ghast to only 50?
Emerald Thu Jul 17 01:37:08 1997:
if the long desc says i can read the message, why tell me what it says when i just look at it?  maybe an add_action _read wouldbe good here

how about changing the description through here to not be that same for all rooms. The path from here does not lead back near a garden it just leads back east.
Mangla Sat Feb 22 16:02:34 1997:
maybe describe teh trees a little bit more in the main desc.
Mangla Sat Feb 22 16:18:02 1997:
Use standard exits!! This is too hard to navigate half the time. Players are lazy. :)
Mangla Sat Feb 22 16:49:27 1997:
From one room to the next I had forgotten about the tree stump, Need to maybe rearrange these descs to make it stand out a little bit more or mention the stump in this room.

if you are going to change the look for the elf, why not include that it is feeling sick too to follow the same sort of lines that other monsters give?

Kryll Tue Jun 10 14:05:09 1997:
why is there nothing up here? shouldn't there be something perhaps?
Kryll Tue Jun 10 14:13:55 1997:
add an option for "dirt" in the dig function
Kryll Tue Jun 10 14:19:28 1997:
question: If the prairie is to the east and the woods is to the west and you can still travel north on this "road", then when is this mountain?
Kryll Tue Jun 10 14:21:52 1997:
maybe in the stream desc you could mention about how inviting it is as opposed to how deep and fast it is, since i had no idea i could swim here
Kryll Tue Jun 10 14:30:24 1997:
instead of all the printed messages, you may want to consider a few quick call_outs
Kryll Tue Jun 10 14:41:42 1997:
maybe add an integer that you can set every reset to be like num = 1 + random(5) and then clone that many gophers instead of only 1
Kryll Tue Jun 10 15:05:58 1997:
maybe increase the wc of the horns to 10 or so
Kryll Tue Jun 10 15:26:41 1997:
increase the cost of the boots to around 5000
Kryll Tue Jun 10 15:30:52 1997:

Kryll Tue Jun 10 15:36:43 1997:
change the down add_action to overwriting the move function
Kryll Tue Jun 10 15:46:00 1997:
maybe have in the monster a set_monster_died thing that says that his ghost sinks into the floor...and now that you notice it does seem kind of strange...then in the search just make sure the mystic is not here...also make sure he cannot be feared
Kryll Tue Jun 10 16:05:29 1997:
where were you expecting the player to get the oil from?
Kryll Tue Jun 10 16:11:07 1997:
can you add one more sentence to the desc of husky
Kryll Tue Jun 10 16:39:42 1997:
make an object variable inside the sword to store who wields it...that way you can easily check my_wielder->query_alignment() ... that way don't need anoher call
Kryll Tue Jun 10 18:07:51 1997:
the only other comment would be that in the evil side perhaps the cats in the rooms should prevent players from going any further to the prince
Kryll Tue Jun 10 18:09:41 1997:
maybe have the hag prevent moving north
Emerald Sat Jun 14 00:58:11 1997:
can one not go back north to the treeline?
Mishikal Sat Jun 14 10:48:52 1997:

it would REALLY be good to have a mountain desc if you want the players to search it
Kryll Mon Jun 16 16:43:17 1997:
instead of basing it off the player's real name, base it off his size...makes modifying the hole more realistic
Soulsong Thu Jun 19 23:47:16 1997:
make it so you can examine the rack
Uglymouth Wed Jun 25 22:44:38 1997:
when I originally coded this I had the idea to have players invest in this institute. Maybe this could still be done later, or maybe I add this to merchant guild idea list ;-)

you might want to change the room desc so that it is not assumed that the idol mob is present - if someone comes here after it's been killed, then the desc doesn't make much sense.  you could try something like there is an engraven idol in the wall, and a slot carved out on the ground where it would norally stand
Emerald Tue Jul 15 19:58:45 1997:
if there are 2 exits from the room, don't say that the only exit is down
