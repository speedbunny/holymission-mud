[sauron         ] [Sep 21] [new level system                             ]

Could someone tell me what we are waiting for before we install the
new 99 level system? How many of the GMs (besides myself) have still
to modify their guilds? As a temporary fix for the Monks, I am simply going
to shadow query_legend_level() so that I can finish my thesis before I finish
off the guild recode.

Does anyone know what's going on?

Change the appr.c to have the wiz_level var and make it
such that players can have a formula for XP and advance
through as many levels as they want and not be limited.
This will free up player levels for experimentation and
make wizzes able to check things from player level points of view.
