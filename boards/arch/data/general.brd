Here is the deal I will be proposing to Tatsuo. Let me
know what you think of it.

I have a machine that is running a copy of the current HM.
Sauron, Kryll and I are currntly in the process of updating
and improving the lib on that box. I just got this box up the
other day, Monday I think. What I would propose is that if you
are truly willing to help get this place back up and running
you would come and help us do the lib rework and design on
those boxes and only make bug fixes and areas here for now.
This would mean you have a knowledge fo the lib and a hand in
how it is designed. Some of the goals on this are to make
"infinite" levels and a more "skill" based guild system.
Sauron has done alot of work already breaking the player
and wizard objects out into bin commands allowing us to increase
the flexibility and update speed for bug fixes, without taking
down the whole mud. Kryll has race and guild ideas that he is
putting into play. Race will make more of a difference than
just your size, and we will have multi-classing if I remember
correctly.

Does this interest you?

-----

that is the proposal I plan on putting forth. I figure it
is a win win situation. If he is willing to help, then we give
him the ability to truly help us. If he is not, then hopefully
the worst thing that happens is that my local copy  (with backup)
gets messed up, and not the real thing.

Questions? Comments?

[sauron         ] [Oct 24] [Re: tats                                     ]

I would like to know specifically what you would have Tatsuo work on
before I pass judgement - I have a few things that I am part-way through
completing, such as the bin system and player/immortal object changes  
(disecting player.c and adding the infinite level code), that I don't want
messed with right now.

I don't know what other people are working on (if anything) but I'm sure
there are things that he could work on as some sort of tester project   
without jeapodizing more crutial parts of the lib.  I don't know what the
current situation is with the guild/race/religion plans, but if there's
anything concrete to work on there then maybe that is a possibility.

While I'm on the subject of changes, I feel now is a good time to bring up
the need for some sort of version control system on the development site.
If we are going to have several people actively coding on the new lib,  
then we need some way to avoid 2 people working on the same code at the
same time.

Nothing annoys me more than getting a mail from someone saying that they'd
made a 'small change' to a file that I was working on, and then having to
hunt through the file to find the change so that I don't overwrite it.
What's even worse is not getting a mail about a change, but then, since I
didn't know there was a change, I don't feel bad about overwriting it. :)

I propose a system whereby you, 'the coder', checks out a block of code
(eg player object code) to work on, and that no-one else makes changes to
that code, including all but life-threatening bug fixes, until it is
checked back in.  Less crutial bug-fixes should be noted (eg mailed to
'the coder' who is working on the files) or fixed when the upgrade is
complete. New additions and concept changes should probably be discussed
with 'the coder' to ensure that something similar is not currently being
implemented, and then someone can add the code when current work is
complete.

Before anything major takes place, I would like to get the rest of the
command structure in place. I have a couple of wizard commands left to   
write, and then it's just the player stuff. Once they're all in, it'd be
nice to have a few people test everthing out. Redsexy is back so I'm   
hoping that she'll finish off writing the feelings.

Feel free to make comments/suggestions (preferably constructive) and
hopefully we can get things moving again around here.

[airborne       ] [Oct 25] [Re: tats                                     ]

I have a couple questions, and a few comments...

Firstly, I have no opposition to the idea Mangla proposed.  However
if I were Tatsuo, I wouldn't accept such a proposal.  Basicly you 
want him to do what you want him to do, code what you want him to code,
and if he does a good enough job shining your shoes you'll let him
out of the basement?  I don't see how you can question his coding
one day, and the next invite him to do lib work...  that seems assinine.
Then assume he does everything you hope he will, how do you then tell
him he can't get promoted on the real HM?  


Secondly, I'd like to ask where this copy of the mud is that Redsexy
and Tatsuo are coding on, and I haven't heard a thing about?  No 
winder I have been contemplating retirement, there's no consideration
given to others around here at times.  Last i heard was the note
Mangla left a few months ago that he was planning on setting up
a mirror site, but then I haven't heard a thing since...  what's 
up with that?

And if there is a mirror site where all this work is being done,
why hasn't anyone involved submitted a list of things that are being
worked on to the players who have only been asking about it for years?
Why is there absolutely no discussion of these important things 
among the Arches... or has there been plenty of discussion, just taking
place behind my back?

[sauron         ] [Oct 25] [Re: tats                                     ]

First, I wasn't the one who suggested that Tatsuo be allowed back at all.
As far as I was concerned, I was perfectly happy without him around
(in an immortal capacity).

Second, I only set up the mirror on Thursday and it still isn't fully
debugged and ready for people to use for development. When it is, you
will be told, and a list of work will be posted.
[airborne       ] [Oct 25] [Re: tats                                     ]

Again, I had no idea how long this was around.  The way Mangla was 
talking it sounded like this had been around for quite a while 
and so much work has been done.  When you mentioned that Redsexy 
is working on feelings at the other site, it made me wonder just
how long its been up.  I had no idea who had a site up, or that one
was up until the last few days.  As far as I knew, Mangla was planning
on setting up a site, so don't take this as a personal attack against
you.

As for Tatsuo, I thought we all realized he should never be higher
than Wizard level.  I didbn't think that was in question.

[sauron         ] [Oct 25] [Re: tats                                     ]

I guess I was expecting some sort of personal attack after being 
awol for so long... :) Should learn to be less paranoid huh?
[airborne       ] [Oct 25] [Re: tats                                     ]

Around here, paranoid is probably etched in stone somewhere.

[mangla         ] [Oct 26] [Re: tats                                     ]

Chronology:
Many months ago the mirror was up for two weeks or so becuase
I had my computer in the office. Gave people a chance to look
at what had bene done by Sauron mainly. Redsexy started working
on some feelings for Sauron.
I had to take the mud down becuas eI needed my computer at
home again.

I have a new computer at home, and so bought the old computer in
and have it set up as a dedicated mirror site for development.
I have spent many hours on it getting things to compile and
then sauron was gonna make some minor changes to the "expternal"
code to make the password systems work again. After that it would
be ready to come back up for testing by more than one or two.
This was all last week. Hopefully by the end of this week, we
will be more inclined to have people start further area/monster/etc.
development over there. Plus have input on how the rest of the lib
will shape up. Nothing to keep in the dark about becuase there
is only the first vestiges of a form there. :)

As for "shining shoes" and such. I never questioned Tatsuo's
coding ability, I always knew it was fairly rudimentary. What
I do question is his motivations and intentions. Those are
part of character which has been constantly in question.

What he would work on is what he wanted to work on. If Kryll wants
some help with the race/guild/religions stuff then I think Tatsuo
could help there. If tatsuo just wants to code areas and monsters,
then atleast he can have a nice stable testing place to make sure
everything works before moving it here.

We would not be telling him what to do, we would list what needs
done and he could choose what to help on. Or choose not to help.
I do not think I mentioned promotion here at any time though.

[airborne       ] [Oct 26] [Re: tats                                     ]

Not to be a pain in the ass or anything, but Mangla, you were the 
one who questioned Tatsuo's coding.  If I recall properly you
stated 'After looking at Tatsuo's code before I could not classify
him in the category of a coder.'  Certainy you can understand how someone
took that a bit differently than what you are proposing now.

Either way, I have no problem with your proposal if tatsuo agrees.  
However, let us keep in mind that the whole purpose is to get rid of
the process of delay and get things moving now.  The purpose is to
get people back to the real HM.  We need to keep this in mind if
the time frame gets extended too far as to counter the original 
purpose.

[mangla         ] [Oct 26] [return                                       ]

I talked to Tats today. First time we have been on at the same
time. I told him about the new place and offered him the chance
to help out over there or just code and test his areas and stuff.
He liked the idea, and said all he would like to do is work with
Wilbie to get some things up and running. I also said it would be
early next week before other stuff was ready, and he said,
"Been waiting 3 years, whats one more weekend." So last chance for
anyone to nix this, and for Sauron to fix the password system on 
the test site.

Out of curiosity, what did ny do to be promoted to Elder again?
I know his guild is buggy, and he steals half the code on here to
place elsewhere, but I was curious what the criteria was for this.

Was there a limit to being bugged about it? or was it Holiday Good Cheer?
or was it a prior promise only now fullfilled ?

Actually, I was under the impression there was a bug that demoted people
and since there wasn't a note or email otherwise, I assumed he was
telling me the truth.

Ok. We can live with that. I was just wondering.
If you are wondering, he is refering to the time that we
had lost the WIZSAVE.o and all wizards were gone. Not everyone
got back to thier former levels, but some did.

Another thing, I went through the wizlist and removed some
old wizzes from it. I have a list of wizzes that need areas
recoded or removed also that we could remove.

PLEASE do not reinstate these wizzes without having arch
vote first. One of the reasons for removal is last login
over a year ago.

[airborne       ] [Feb  6] [Re: nylakoorub                               ]

A question about this Arch vote you mentioned, when or where are
these votes taking place.  I didn't hear of one about Tatsuo's 
promotion.  I would have liked to have heard what people's 
thoughts were on his behaviour and attitude since his return 
before making him an Elder.

Honestly, we need guidelines for what we do as arches.  Either
we have a vote for these things, or we don't. 

[mangla         ] [Feb  6] [Re: nylakoorub                               ]

To elder is ok. Since there was the push to even bring him back, and I
have talked/worked with him atleast 3 times a week since then, I made the
assumption that he was welcome. I have also not seen anyone else really.
As for voting on bringing the people back, I would post a note on who
they are and some background. Then give a 2-3 weeks deadline and go with
who ever is heard from. Some of these wizards I removed have not looged
in for as long as I have been a wizard!

-Mangla
[airborne       ] [Feb  8] [Re: nylakoorub                               ]

Mangla, I think you need to read up on the board here if you think
that no one would mind if Tatsuo were higher than Wiz.  In the 
very same message I posted about bringing him back I mentioned that
I didn't want to see him higher than Wiz.  

All that is water under the bridge.  However, I think we need to look
at the precidence this has set, and see whom else it has effected.
Exos has been around and working as best he can for a long while, 
and even though he's not the most likable fellow all the time
I don't think it was right to completely overlook him for promotion.
While Tatsuo was away being punished, Exos stuck around and did what
he could for HM.  When Tatsuo returned and unreasonably attacked 
Exos every chance he got, Exos took it in stride and never let it
get the best of him.  He should have been considered, and these are the things 
I would have liked to bring to everyone's attention if promotions 
had come up for debate like we all agree they should.

Lets all agree, no promotions for any reason without other arches being aware of it and having an opportunity for debate.

[mangla         ] [Feb  8] [Re: nylakoorub                               ]

I hear a motion for Exos to be Elder then?

Since he has started doing more than complaining
lately and taking extra time to help others I have
no objection.

Comments will close in 17th and a decision will be made then.
That will give 1 and a laf weeks for comment.

[silas          ] [Mar  3] [Reorganization                               ]

Carrying on from a thread started on the wiz message board I
think it would be a good idea of some of the less active arches,
including myself, were replaced with harder working ones. Some
of us just don't log in enough to warrant our rank and there
are plenty of lower ranking wizards who are willing to put
a lot of time into this place but who don't have the power to 
do so. Some of these prospects have done questionable things in
the past but at this point we just need to sit back and think 
about what needs to be done around here and who'll be able to do it.
It's not easy to overhaul the admins like this but I think it's 
a sorely needed change and hopefully one that will get HM back on
track.
-Silas
[mangla         ] [Mar  3] [Re: Reorganization                           ]

I will send Sauron and Kryll an email, if they are not interested in
being active then I will take care of that side. If you are willing to
retire Silas, then that can be taken care of also. you can also
drop down to Elder. the problem I have is this: There are no "lib"
coders in the bunch. That is very complicated job and it has taken
a while to take care of the last "improvements" that came out of patience
and llort. I would be willing to move some more active people to elder,
but until I am no longer able to log in, or a "suitable" lib coder is
found I would like to hold on making arches.

Agreed, there are some people here with questionable backgrounds, and
that should be considered, but I know that you and Airborne are not gonna
go mucking in the lib when you do not understand something. I would like
either someone like that, or the lib coder that could make changes in a
thought through manner. Right now we are getting alot of suggestions that
are not implementable for solid reasons. Those that are I am implementing,
even if it appears nothing is happening according to Tatsuo. ;)

Well, enough for that note. Think on it and let me know.

I agree that we do need more lib coders at Arch level and that
there really is no point in promoting anyone else to Arch
until we find someone with that skill. The thought of .[C.[C.[C.[C.[Cting
Tatsuo to Arch gives me the shivers personally but on the other
hand the more productive coders will always work with a hand behind
their backs until they reach that level. I'm not sure how all this
will work out but if room at the top needs to be cleared out to make 
room for a new arch I'm more than willing to step down to Retd level
as I'm not on much as is. If there's anything I can do to help let
me know.

Rather than bring back wizards who wish to return one at a time,
I have asked Wilbie to compile a list of who is asking and where
we can contact them.  I asked him to get me this list by Tuesday
and to not pester anyone until then about it.  On Tuesday he will
give the list to me, I'll do a bit of initial research, and post 
my findings here.  I had hoped to accomplish two things this way:

1. Give Wilbie a specific task with specific instructions.
I want to see that he is reliable responsible and able to complete
a task as instructed.  It seems he's ignored the basic parts of that
thus far, the get it done and don't pester until it is done.  Bedfore
we consider Wilbie for a promotion, lets give him specific 
responsibilities and not just let him work with Tatsuo exclusively.
In the long term it will be better to see him work on his own, 
especially with Tatsuo's history.

2. It'll allow us to look over what we will be getting into if we
start bringing back old wizards.  Are we ready to accomidate what 
could potentially be 10-20 wizards.  Are we willing to deal with 
turning people away if they have a history?  Do we have the means in
placeto support the less experienced coders?

I'd like to address these issues together, and lets assess our needs
before we start giving promotions to people.  Nothing against Wilbie
but he did nothing while Tatsuo wasn't here, and from what I have seen
he's only worked with recently.  Lets see what our future goals are, 
what we will need to reach those goals and work in a proper manner.

[mangla         ] [Mar  6] [Re: Two items                                ]

Kewl. Sounds like a plan.

Just a few things I would like to point out. Wilbie has had
a working and improving area for the past many months, even
before Tatsuo was back. Nothing complicated, just an area he
cut his teeth on and then went back constantly to improve.

Old wizzes returning can be good, and bad. I realize that as
much as anyone. The thing I was looking for was why are they
gone in the first place. Some banish files have no reasons.
Some are gone becuase Muzmuz got mad at them. Some becuase
they deserved it.

I am more than willing to tell someone "No, sorry."

Anyway, I moved Darastor on up to wiz because he has
been here a while and I have seen his work. good when he
sets his mind to it.

[airborne       ] [Mar 22] [Reinstated wizard suggestion                 ]

The list of former wizards I have before us includes the following:

Trout, Ethos, Saffron, Baer, and Kitty.

This now means we need to have a stated policy on removing wizards and 
what it will take to have them re-instated should they be removed.  I 
have always been under the notion that once a player reached Wizard 
level, they would not be deleted.  But what's done cannot be undone, so 
we need a set of guidelines that we will follow in this instance.

To that end, I am suggesting the following as a starting point for 
further discussion.  I am not saying that this is the only way, or
even the best way, just a basis for the start of this discussion.

Let us return the wizards who are asking to be reinstated to Newwiz or 
Apprentice, depending on the level they obtained previously.  Each should
be asked what they plan on doing before they wiz again.  Lets have a list
of possible tasks on hand that we can suggest if they are uncertain what
they want to or are capable of doing.  I would also suggest that we only
reinstate people at certain times of the year, to coincide with the 
proposed wizard promotion schedule.

The rationale:  We currently are expanding manpower to where we can 
absorb the influx of additonal coders. By limiting re-instatement to a 
scheduled time frame, we allow ourselves to monitor people who are asking 
to return to make certain that they will be around long enough to bother 
with it.  We also allow ourselves a better understaning of our needs over
the next quarter so we can better determine promotions and such.  By 
reinstating no higher than Newwiz, we ensure that returning wizards have
the opportunity to refresh their coding knowledge if they need it, and 
to find a niche immediately.
