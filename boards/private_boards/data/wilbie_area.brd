I am currently working on a few monsters that are a bit tougher than
Sheankala...  I am also working on a few smaller monsters to pester
you with.  

There will also be some new equipment, perhaps some potions and scrolls,
and maybe even some magic stuff.

There are still some powerful items in the cathedral that have never 
been found by players...  Look carefully, you'll be pleased with what
you find :)

No, people have found those :)

I love this place, just sit back & soak up xp, maybe a sign elsewhere would help to guide people to it

[wilbie         ] [Sep  4] [Re: I love this place                        ]

Thanks!  I don't think there will a sign any time soon though.  If we had
signs all over the place, there would be no reason for people to go out
and explore :)

Besides, the cult doesn't like visitors!  They are always getting killed
by them...
