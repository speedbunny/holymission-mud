Jewel is a girl who make me smile.
Jewel is the best jewel of the nile
Jewel cheers me up when I am down
Jewel never ever makes me frown
Jewel is the one who brightens my day
Jewel chases all my cares away
Jewel makes all others look like fools
All I can say is...Kewl Jewel Rewlz!!!!

Where is Jewel?
  I've not seen her
Kinda glad that
  I've not been her
No offense but
  I'm a man child
Being a woman
  Would be too wild
Well that's all
  I'll say for now
You'll have to tell me
  You're doin how?

[exos           ] [Jan 13] [The Eastern Star                             ]

Far above the Eastern Horizon,
One lone star shines eternal.
Shining and shining on,
Wanting to come to me.

This simple Jewel vibrates,
As it moves across the sky,
Circling around Heaven's gates,
Wanting to go home.

One lonely diamond skipping,
with the beauty of the ages,
Watching as the others go tipping,
Knowing I'm all hers.
