[sauron         ] [Sep  5] [Welcome                                      ]

Greetings, and welcome to my Mentee Room. Here you can relax, chat, discuss
your areas, or whatever ideas you may have, and leave notes for me if I'm
not around. This room is also a library... in time I will install a system
whereby each of you can have a book in the 'areas' section of the library
which you can use to store information about your area projects... maps,
summaries of your area, quest info... I will also make available a set of
std files for you to look at for inspiration. Right now, I only have a
std room, but I will write more when I find time.

Please feel free to use this room, and let me know if there is anything
you think I should add.

Ps. The library commands are:

browse: This command allows you to browse the library, or a given section
        of the library, and see what books are available for you to read.
select: This command allows you to select a book to read, and this
        activates the read command. If there is more than one book with
        the same name, you can select a specific book using the syntax
        'select <section>:<book>'.
read  : This command allows you to read a book once selected. The argument
        'index' will list the chapters of the book, and you can read a
        chapter using 'read #' or 'read <chapter>'.

I added some crazy cmds which can be used in this room only:

csay, ctell, cchat, cchat/, cme, ctitle and cpretitle.

More may follow. :)
