It's not particle physics, it's cosmology.  Somewhat related, but on a
vastly larger scale.  Besides, the "particle" stage of pysics is dead.
Everyone knows that particles are local spacial variations!

Everything exists in the cosmos?
This begs a definition of "cosomos".
[wilbie         ] [Feb  4] [How to destroy the universe                  ]

There is a theory in modern Cosmology as to why the universe went through
a period of inflation, early in it's existence.  During this period (which
lasted about 10^-34 seconds) called the Plank Epoch, the universe grew
exponentially, billions of billions of BILLIONS of times.  In fact, during
the Plank Epoch, the cosmos is estimated to have grown to about 80% of
it's current size.

Anyway, I digress.  You need a theory to explain how the universe could
expand so rapidly - billions of times faster than light, in fact.  You
can't just say "just because" in scientific circles or they make fun of
you a bit.  

The theory is this.  The vacuum of space contains energy, and is therefore
not a "true" vacuum (which would contain NOTHING).  This "false" vacuum
would never be noticed because it's literally everywhere.  The energy is
a scalar field, and is part of time-space itself.  This energy would be
capable of causing the inflation during the Plank Epoch.  As the energy
in space-time grows weaker (being dispersed as space-time grows), the
rate of inflation will slow down.

However, if enough energy were pumped into a localized area in the form
of a scalar field (and somehow "kept" in the area) by some means, the
energy level of that location would increase.  When the energy grew to
a critical level, it would create space-time inflation.  Granted, it would
never be anywhere near the power involved in the Big Bang, but it would
be rather nasty!  Basically, you'd have a "sphere" of space time expanding
at the speed of light from the point of origin, going on forever.  Oh, and
destroying EVERYTHING (matter, energy, space) in its path!

Scientists have various theories as to how such an energy level could be
achieved (it's about 1/10000th what we can do in our best particle 
accelerators - but certainly feasable if weREALLY tried)
and they even have theories on how to contain the energy in a suitable
field.  Obviously, they aren't trying TOO hard to test it out :)

Granted, I am not as learned as Master Wilbie in these areas, but
I thought energy could not be destroyed, only converted or dispersed...
[wilbie         ] [Feb 22] [Re: Hey, wait a sec...                       ]

If you're referring to my "how to destroy the universe" post, you're
correct.  Thermodynamical laws prohibit the destruction of energy.  
However, in this case time-space itself is destroyed.  The energy and
matter might go "somewhere" when the time-space bubble hit it...

Most likely, matter and energy would be broken down completely.  You'd
have a lot of trouble recognizing any of it afterwards :)

Spam, when traveling at the speed of light

Therefore, most of the more intelligent species construct their spacecraft from 
this durable material

Just a little known fact, that Wilbie will elaborate upon.

Spam is actually intelligent.  It has been known to make conversation
with dishwashers and men from Peru.  It is also able to travel back
in time before its own expiry date.
