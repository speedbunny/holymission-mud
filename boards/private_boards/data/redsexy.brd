I really miss Airborne's poems on this board.... so I thought I'd put
one here myself to liven things up...

The HOLY MISSION by Sarah Eaglesfield

The day he came the one they call the Summoner,
The day that he bought chaos to our land,
Our good lord Herp came down and sat amongst us,
And told us one day that we'd understand....

The monks took refuge in Chantilly's garden,
The mages went and hid within their tower,
The jedi called for thunderbolts and lightning,
The vagabonds sent time back by the hour,
The fighters bought new weapons and new armour,
The ninja's to their masters turned in shame,
The thieves plotted murder in their hideout,
The wizards tried to find someone to blame,

But nothing stopped the power of the Summoner,
He armies roamed throughout the Mission's lands,
For each that died he bring to life another,
And still the guilds just could not understand...

Damn I had enough of typing this poem... part two to follow...

somewhere in time
a dark figure
roams the realm
of magic and
chaos, of death
and despair, and
however long it
takes he will
conquer, riding his
black horse, cursing
all of the
weak that fall
under his blade,
and he laughs
at the people
that try to
fight death's grip,
because they just
do not understand
that they're next
to feel the
wrath of death,
naive, unaware of
their own mortality,
they rush into
the fray just
to be cut
down by the
sword of death.

I was pondering this the other day.

If people who live in glass houses shouldn't thrown stones, does that
mean that people who live in stones should throw glass houses?

Just curious

Not necessarily,
But people who live in glass houses
should probably get dressed with the lights off.

What about exhibitionists?

Oh... well I suppose that'd be fine then =)
And as we're being fair, the voyeurs can camp outside.
