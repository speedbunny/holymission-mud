Does this mean that if I ever get my arse in gear and wiz that
I can code a stonehenge kind of area where all the women have
to be stripped naked, brainwashed into dancing round the stones,
generally abused and then sacrificed to various different
tree gods?

WHAT a waste.

SEX!!!!!

	Such a wonderful topic... one of my favorites! I think I 
	want a radio show of my own, all sex talk... call in,
	tell me your fantasies, your experiences... and be sure
	to say "Yes, Mistress" when you call!

LIFE!!!

	It's pretty boring unless you seize every day with 
	both hands and squeeze every drop of excitement from it
	that you can! 

MEN WITH BIG MUSCLES!!!!!
	They'll be my mascots... big, bronze men with massive muscles
	and itty-bitty loincloths... or thongs. Ladies, help me decide
	how to dress my men. 

Just think- a mud-oriented talk/radio-type thingy! And YOU
can make it happen! Tell me what you want...

What if Dr. Suess Did Technical Writing?
 
Here's an easy game to play.
Here's an easy thing to say:
 
If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port
And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort,
And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort,
Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!
 
If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,
And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash,
And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash,
Then your situations hopeless, and your system's going to crash!
 
You can't say this?
What a shame sir!
We'll find you
Another game sir.
 
If the label on the cable on the table at your house,
Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse,
But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol,
That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,
 
and your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss
So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,
Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,
'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!
 
When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk,
And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary RISC,
Then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM.
Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your mom!
