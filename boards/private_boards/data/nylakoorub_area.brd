[sargon         ] [Apr 10] [why here?                                    ]

If this is  truly a newbie area then why is it behind fifty zillion orcs?....just a thought

[nylakoorub     ] [Apr 14] [upgrading clearing....                       ]

As soon as the new lib is done...
then i will upgrade the clearing and rainforest.....

I thank all the newbies that like my area....

I will think, about the Orc problemm.. oh... i do have that...
orc and orges can not come into my area.... unless a wizard
trans a orc into the area...

I am thinking about moving the area over to the east or adding something
else....

In the clearing i plan to add more rooms... that are off the path...

so please be patient....

Thanks

Hi, Nyla.... this is a really cool area....

The clearing monsters are not that tough for newbies....

how about adding some more rooms, maybe off the dirt path...
maybe a little town or something....
Maybe you can design  newbie quest.....

.[D        You did a good job..... keep up the good work....

                             Junior....... :)

[nylakoorub     ] [Jun 17] [fixed rainforest temp...                     ]

The problem was myt invis chatter object, which made the rooms
make jungles...   i have removed, plus i have be asked to remove this..
because it might cause drain on memory...

With the new lib and since i have to redo all the rooms... i decided
to upgrade and add more stuff....

I am making a item...
    the compass...
        which will give you alias.. for my directions in my area...
     instead of type fowardleft.. just type fl
   
This item i have not decided where to put it... it deoends on my area intentions.. i will keep you posted on stuff..

          you see....
