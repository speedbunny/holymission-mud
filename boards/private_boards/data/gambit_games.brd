[gambit         ] [Mar 26] [New board... New Ideas                       ]

Yes we just got the new and improved board look so
I had to change the topic around again to make it better.
I know alot of the players here are into Mortal Kombat
and Killer Instinct and other hot Arcade games and video
games for the PC and home systems so I wanted to make this board
into a discussion board of what you think are some great games
and what you think our some cheezy games.

This is also a great place to ask for hints on games, moves for
all arcade games and video games, including Mortal Kombat I,
II and III and Killer Instinct.
I want to know what kind of games you guys play and what you
think would be good for other players to play.

Don't let the title of this board fool you cause I am thinking
of a title to show its for all games, including the games based
on my areas...
If anyone has a good title, lets hear it...

I am really into Mortal Kombat and am very excited about Mortal III.  I would
like to know as much info as possible about Mortal III.  I realize that 
there is not much info out there, but anyone who knows anything concerning MK III
please write it here.  Thanks for your support.

Sorry, i belong to the number who DO NOT

I think the game is boring, really.

This is what I know about Mortal Kombat III, since I do live close
to Chicago and we have the one and only test game out right now.

MK III have 14 characters in it total, 9 are new and 5 are old..
The old players are Sub-Zero, Sonya, Kano, Liu Kang, Jax
and Kung Lao, my mistake.. 6 are old.
There are 2 new robo-ninjas after Sub-Zero, Shao Kahn's dead
wife, a military/police officer, and a few more...
If you really want, I can go into details of what they look like
and why they are in the game.
The graphics are still the same but have the sharpness and detail
of Killer Instinct... The music is more Techno-Pop, sort
of the same music on Orchid stage, on the chicago rooftop...
But not all of it. Theres also a new 'Run' button used for 
Combos but no combos have really been found.
The release date is April 3 of this year, this is the info I got
from Midway, makers of the game but there
is also rumor of the release date being April 15, and it goes 
nationwide... I know a few moves for a few of the guys and gals in
the game and know 2 fatalities for Kano.
Hope this helps.. anything else, just ask.

This game rules...
The game is based like Doom where you run around from a first
person point of view.. seeing through their eyes but its based
around Star Wars...You can kill StormTroopers and Imperial
guards and even Booba Fett.
You can pick up weapons like blasters and thermonuclear bombs...
If you like Doom and you love Star Wars.. this game will be a blast for you.

Gotta say, once again you've come up with a great idea here Gambit. 
Good to see a fresh change from tired old stuff.  Anyway, formalities
aside, I was wondering if you knew how Kano got back into MK3 
after supposedly dying in MK1.   Also I'd like to know if you've got 
any cheat sheets on Glacius and his combos.

Yeah the story with Kano goes like this...
In Mortal Kombat I, Sonya went to go capture Kano but somehow
Kano escaped and robbed Shao Kahn of his gold.
So in Mortal Kombat II, The special forces team sent Sonya after
Kano again but this time in the outer world where Shao Kahn
ruled, Jax soon got a distress signal from Sonya and that where
Jax comes into Mortal Kombat II. Shao Kahn captured both Kano
and Sonya and forced Jax to fight in the tournament. But
after Jax wins (this is from his ending) Kano escaped capture
again. So in Mortal Kombat III, Kano is pissed off and is
out for blood cause he was captured and used as a slave for
Shao Kahn. I dont know Kano's, Sonya's or Jax's ending yet
for Mortal Kombat III so I don't know what happens then.

For the Glacius cheat sheet, just post your email address
or you can mail me it and I will send you my Killer Instinct
cheat sheet filled with everything.

P.S. Thanxs for the complement on the new board. I hope to
make this board very popular and hope to talk about all kinds of
games.

Icehouse, your cheat sheet is on the way man...
I was thinking of all the systems I had or still have and this is
the list I came up with --
1. Atari 2600
2. (3) ColecoVisions - Yes three of them
3. Nintendo
4. Sega Master System
5. Super Nintendo
6. Sega Genesis
7. Tons of games for every system.

Well anyway... anyone play any good games lately for the arcade
or for the PC...
I just picked up Descent and Dark Forces, both play like Doom
but only better...

Downloading demo games from the net has become a new found hobby for me.  Recently I 
downloaded a demo of Heretic.  This doom style game rules!  You have a cool wand that shoots missiles and
also you can get this cool crossbow and all these cool artifacts.  One artifact turns your enemies into chickens.  Also typing in the key word
cockadoodledoo turns yourself into a chicken.  Everyone should check out this game.  I saw the complete version in the store for only $9.99!  Yeah, check this one out.

Hey thanks for the sheets Gambit, been kickin it with the combos. 
Just tried out Dark Forces too and gotta say thats some classy stuff.
Anyway, has anyone seen or played that new Xmen game at the 
arcade?  I think its called Xmen 2 : Children of the Atom.  I dunno 
'bout that game... I haven't played it or anythin', but I've seen it and
it looks pretty sorry.   The idea for an Xmen fighter-type game is
good, and they threw in some cool chars like Omega Red, Psylocke 
and Silv Samurai...  but the game itself doesn't have the greatest 
graphics and it doesn't look like it'd be a whole lot of fun to play.
The weird thing is, I always see a LOT of people playing it so I'm 
wonderin' if anyone's tried it.

Gotta risk another quote :

Gambit,

I heard recently that there is a recent addition to the Internet
that is a discussion board for MK III.  This board is updated
very often and I heard that it contains all the moves, combos,
fatalities, and other secrets.  Do you know anything about this
and can you find out where it is on the Net?

Thanks,

By the way, I know this guy who's really good at Mortal and pretty
good at KI too.  He will challenge anyone.  Any takers?

Your welcome man...
Yeah I have played X-men 2: Children of the Atom and its pretty
good to ok.. Its like the rest of the fighting games with combos
but its more of a street fighter deal, no fatalities and mostly no
blood... If you like stuff like street fighter and x-men, you'll
love it, if not... than its ok.

[gambit         ] [Apr  1] [re:MK III ... again                          ]

Dont know about any new boards but the board I'm on
for the internet is

alt.games.mk

All it does is talk about MK III and all of MK I and II and it
even has postings by Ed Boon. Check it out...

About this guy... I have never seen him play but I'm running
on a 98% for Mortal Kombat I and II.. This means out of 100 matches
I'll lose 2 and for Killer Instinct.. I'm running a 87% so
it would be a good match...

Anybody that has played Descent knows exactly how those levels seem
to twist and turn every which way.  Well, in case anyone has any major
complaints, I know the main level designer, Yuan, pretty well.  He'll
probably laugh at your complaints, but still nice to know a designer.

Maybe he'll let me design a level next time?
