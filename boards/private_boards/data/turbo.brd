[zathras        ] [Jan 21] [Welcome!                                     ]

This area has been 3 years in the making.  It is designed for Legends.
This area is player friendly.  There are no death traps, nor poison.  I hate them both.
Also, If you have ideas for this area, please, post them here.

Thank You and Good Luck,
Anla'shok Na Turbo and Anla'shok Zathras

perhaps if it were more difficult the area would be
suited for legends...
[turbo          ] [Feb  9] [Tiana & difficulty                           ]

If you want this area more difficult, that can be arranged.
I will keep it the way it is for now.
If 3 people post here that they want this area a little harder, I will increase
the weapon and armor classes of the monsters.
When this area was created, legend levels were, well, the stuff of legends
While I do not want you people dying in my area, I would like it to be worth your effort

To make life easier for mages, the Rosewood Staff has been renamed Rosewood Wand.  
I hope this makes things easier and doesn't confuse too many people
[turbo          ] [Feb 17] [New things to kill                           ]

The center of my water area (what I call the blue level)
and the palace in what I call my white level (the top most level at the moment)
both have new things added.  Be careful and have fun.

Due to the way my coding was done,
that is, the function I chose to use,
hold (and other spells like it) will not work properly on most of my monsters.
I am not happy about that, and I will be changing it.
This will take time.  I will start level by level, working my way 'up'.
As I finish each level, I will post here.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

For all you non ninja, there is a new weapon.
(Okay, its actually just a old one made better.)
It doesn't require a high strength or a high dexterity to use, unlike most weapons.
It is even useable by mages.
It is at the top-most level of this area.
The Rangers know where it is.
Hope you like it!

Fixed all but the 'red' level (the one with the shivan dragon).
In the instance a mob was not 'fixed', it is noted in its description.
A word of caution:  Anything in the center of an area was excluded from this 'fix'.
Some may be 'hold friendly', some may not.

In my area, there are some armor-types.
Most of these are useable by everyone, including Summoners and Mages.
They aren't very pretty, but they work.

Beware! Anla'shok Marcus Cole has been called upon to aid the Elder's.
He is a Ranger, and as such, he wields powerful weapon, the Minbari Fighting Pike.
Made of mysterious metals, the pike is very light and powerful.


The pike is usable by mages, but be careful.  Marcus is VERY tough.
