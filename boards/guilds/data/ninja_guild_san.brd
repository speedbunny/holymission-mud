[aramir         ] [Mar  7] [Armour etc                                   ]

This is not meant to be a complaint so bear with me.
As a ninja I am now a lot less powerful than as a monk
this seems to be because Monsters can do a lot of damage to mer.

Now I know that I have not got myself any Katana's yet
but still seem to do pretty good damage.

Previously the Ninjas had good self defence but could not wear weapons.

I am struggling to work out what all ther skills are, so a quick question.

Can we wear armour ? (without hindering Ninja skills)
Do we have self defendce ?

What are all the skills ?

Thanks for listening


Aramir


[tetsuhara      ] [Mar  9] [perhaps i can answer this!                   ]

with particular weapons you will do progresively more damage......
or conversely you may have better defense (ie the sai)
we are able to wear armour and (so far) it appears to have no adverse side
effects.
ninja do have a self defense- it is an automatic parry.... as mentioned 
above, the better the defensive weapon you have, the better your parry
will be.... if you have a higher level of hps, obviously you can take
more punishment, so you may not have to use high defense weapons.

finally, you can read all about the skills (barring how to make
poison) by typing in help guild, followed by help <skill> for specific
help......

Hope this helps.

[dorr           ] [Mar 12] [guild quest for the daito                    ]

Description of the quild quest. The quest is VERY hard, only
for ninjas over level 25.
To get the daito you have to kill the ryu, and take his head
to the blacksmith.
Buy some smoke bombs in the guild, then vanish jingu.
Out, and go so much e and s till you arrive to a place with
only one exit, n. There go 1s, you'll be a place with no exits,
and see a huge shadow movind when you look down.
From here dive (barracuda), d (shark), enter cave (kojin),
2w (2 kojins) and 3u you'll be under the water, and if stay 
there too much you'll drown. You'll be advertised for some
time, I advise you to go back to the starting point for air
when you see the message "YOU HAVE TO BREATH SOON!!" go out 
quickly (to the no exit place).
From the last room (the 3rd up) to 1u you can breath, but there 
are 3 kojins, and the wimpy is back under the water.
When you killed this 3 kojins have to go some w and kill some
other kojins, till you arrive to a room with a grate on the
wall. From there to w is the teritory of the ryu. The area is
small (just some rooms), so you'll find the ryu fast.
You have to kill him, behead him, take the key of the grate
and go out to can teleport away. The ryu-s area is non-teleportable.
The ryu: big, strongs, plenty of hp and very powerful. Have some
special attacks with them he can destroy your armour and take
your weapon, even the autoloading one. He breathes poison in the
rooms near him, and have a critical hit wich throws you out 
from his room. Remember, you have to have a sharp weapon to
behead him after you kill him.
When you killed him and gone out from his area have to take the head
to Ujihiro Utsunomiya, tha blacksmith. He will give you the daito.
To find him vanish temple, out, 2s, climb tree, jump rock-ledge, 
s and enter cave. Give head to Ujihiro Utsunomiya, and he'll forge
you a daito.
Good luck for everyone, take care don't be killed!

is a good thing to mumble i hear
[tetsuhara      ] [Mar 18] [heres some things on the bombs               ]

The three bombs are the blinding bomb for which you'll need an egg
some moss (somewhere near the almond tree) and some liquid from the      
fountain.... 

the second bomb is the sneezing bomb... this requires two white peppers
and two red peppers.....

the third bomb requires shikome blood and mukade blood.... and of 
course an egg.....

enjoy!

[psychopath     ] [Mar 23] [wakizashi                                    ]

Allright i'l post how to get the waki.
You go to the caves and find a monster named Mujina. Kill it.
Be careful because it has a special attack thet moves you away from here
and leaves you paralized with madness, so be sure it doesn't have
time to move. Get it's stuff and bring the obsidian ring to the
smith 2s climb tree jump ledge climb up and somewhere south and enter cave
from the temple in forest (vanish temple for starters).
For the ring yopu will get your wakizashi.

[psychopath     ] [Mar 23] [poisoned dart                                ]

buy a dart in shop get a fugu from a fish on the shore, get bark
from the tree in the forest (climb tree, tear bark). go to the temple
in the forest put fugu and bark in cup mumble kayoto sylabatsi.
dip dart in cup, 1 cup contains 3 charges, i think the poison adds up
at least up to 6 doses, all the poison gets into the bloodstream of
the opponent into whom you throw it, so you have to poison it again.
So i think it is useful only against big monsters that you need time
to kill, you dont want to make darts for every halfling you slay.

thanks for the info psycho.... for the moment it appears to be a big help
for higher level ninja to post hints/tips etc. on some of the guild
secrets.... as we get more full-time higher level characters that no the
"tricks" this should negate this necessity..... in the interim though
it seems to be working well.... keep the ideas flowing everyone ;-)
