Hello,
Well, if you don't know already, i'm your new GM.  Don't know
what happened to Gareth but he'll be missed.  I hope to do as
good of a job as he has.  Immediate plans are to get new skills
for low level players and then work on some new ones
for high level.  Any and all suggestions are
welcome and appreciated.  I'll post here when i complete
the one(s) i'm debugging right now and i'll make some
changes in the help files and the book and small
stuff like that.  I bring some experience on guild code with
me from the Jedi guild and hope to do well here.
In the mean time...we need more members...new ones
and return of the old.  As with most muds around Fighter is traditionally the strongest guild
and i see no reason why not here too:)

Now go kick some ass!

New skill called groin.  Its a great skill for low levels
who want an extra attack.  You need to wear boots for it to work
and you need to be in a fight.  It may change a little from
what it is right now but its basically bug free and 
works great.

Hello to all of my old friends.  I am back!  For my new friends,
suffice it to say I am here.  
When I played years ago, the fighters guild was the best around.
Now it seems nobody plays fighter anymore, and I cannot 
understand it.  Just look at the players and you will see how fast 
I have advanced compared to alot of other guilds.  Fighters still
rule (IMHO)!  I know Sargon knows his stuff, and I am sure if we do some recruiting that the fighters
guild will once again emerge as the top guild.  We just need to 
all work together on this.  
The only suggestion that I have is about my hitpoints.
I maxed out at 1000 hp at a con of 24 (I belive it was 24...), and 
although I enjoyed watching my hp rise quickly,
I would rather have all my hp spread out so I would be encouraged to 
keep advancing my stats.  Other than that, I think
everything has been going great.  If anyone ever needs help, 
just let me know, I am here gor my fellow fighters.
Good luck

If you use help <skillname> you might notice that there
are either one of three things...
1.  Nothing is there.
2.  Partial details are there.
3.  Appears to be complete.

This is because there are no specific help files
for skills so i'm making them.

Boots are now available in the armoury for your kicking
pleasure.

Hi all fellow fighters,
  I'm posting just to let you all know that I'm back and 
I'll be on from time to time.  I hope that I'll see more 
fighters on.
[sargon         ] [Mar 29] [Help                                         ]

I think i've gotten most all of the help files up to date.  If you
find a problem with any of them please post it here.

 Thanks
  Sargon

Then that would make you a no one?
