The command guildban is still there and it loads ok... not sure why it
shouldn't work. I'll look into it when I have some free time if you want.

Unfortunately our guild is not bug free.
There is one that I've found and it's just a discrepancy between
out actual level and the level that shows on score.
I think it only does it with legend levels but out Legend level
on score is always one behind out actual legend level.
That's all I've found so far.  Except that sometimes maybe my
soul gets bugged when I wear illegal armour and try to remove it,
do so, and it still keeps it as I'm wearing it. It's a pain cause
most of my attacks miss and specials never go off right. The only
way I've found to fix it has been to quit and return. It doesn't
happen very often but when it does it's REALLY annoying.
oh well, enough bitchin' out of me. Toodles >:)

Hi guys and gals.

I've noticed since Tuppy became a player again that she is an 
"Outer Word Ruless"... is this a spelling mistake or a compliment
to her language skills? Who can tell...

I've noticed a bug with allowable armour and monks. And here's the long
and short of it:

If you attempt to wear a piece of armour that is not allowed to monks
and you are already wearing a piece of armour in that spot. You will
feel uncomfortable in your new clothes and will wear it. If you
attempt to remove it, it is impossible because you are not actually
wearing it and you will still suffer the penalty for wearing illegal
armour.
I've only encountered this problem that I can remember with head wear.
Im not sure if the bug is in the guild soul itself or in the monks
autoloading headband. I know it is very annoying to accidentally try
and wear something and the only way to fix the problem is to quit an
relogin. I haven't found another way that works consistently. 
If you GM's have time could you look at this?
Many thanks.

[azran          ] [Aug  4] [I'm BROKE!!                                  ]

I had just put 1,080,800 coins into the main bank.. i came to the monk's bank 5 minutes later and it said i only had 44,735 (or something like that) so i withdrew that and went to the main bank, and it said I had NO BALANCE!!! if this were any character but a monk, i could live with this, but it COSTS us to advance skills, so losing a MILLION coins REALLY hurts...
If I could get it back I would be very grateful..
Thanks
