[raindell       ] [Mar 15] [Monk Attacks ??                              ]

Heyo, Gotta problem here..

Was out questing in the Raulf/prison/free the prisoners quest thing.
Had a couple of 'weight' problems arise in apparent
connection with some of the items I picked up.
(I'm presuming that's what was causing that problem, I don't know)

On the way *out* of the area, my attacks go weird.
Where normally I was doing 3-4 attacks a round, I'm down to 1 and only 1.
My death attack is now missing signifigantly more often.

After selling things off, I tried battling the monks in the sw corner of the chapel,
just to see what the deal was.
Still only 1 attack per round... and out of 6 'death' attacks
on those monks, 3 connected and killed... 3 failed to even go off.

What's wrong here?....
[raindell       ] [Mar 15] [36 Monk Attacks Revisited                    ]

Huh..

Well, things seem to be functioning correctly again attack-wise.
If this is due to someone's assistance, my great thanks.
If not, I'm puzzled.. but not complaining.
*(chuckle*)

[sargon         ] [Mar 15] [Re: 36 Monk Attacks Revisited                ]

Would help if we knew which items you were holding.
[mangla         ] [Mar 15] [Re: 36 Monk Attacks Revisited                ]

I think it was related to the manner in which items where
moved about in Pretzels area. That has been fixed.

[demolian       ] [Mar 16] [Re: 36 Monk Attacks Revisited                ]

I had a similar problem - problem around the same time
but i quit, came back and everything was fixed :)
some bug that was messed up for a bit

I am now the offical Monk GM revamped of the Monk guild :)
I am looking for Master (Mortal GM of monk guild) and Protectors
and along with ideas for monk guild.

Right now, skills system will be taken out so everything
will be base on stats and level!! I am currently working.
I have completely the new soul already and is working
on revamping all the skills.  but this week and next week
i am bury by school work so i might be on less but i guarantee
you i will complete the revampment of the monk guild :)

Anyway any suggestion or idea plz write it here!!

Sincerely,
Tinman

At the moment i have recruit 1 protector:
Widge
[sargon         ] [Apr  8] [Re: Monk GM                                  ]

Well, i'm glad you're monk GM but i think it sucks
that the skill system is out.

[turbo          ] [Apr  9] [skills                                       ]

You may want to consult the mortal monks beforing doing anything drastic.
[sytar          ] [Apr  9] [monk guild                                   ]

Tinman, thank you for noticing us that you became the GM, 
and that you want to recode the guild.
We wold like to hear more about your ideas. Did you played 
with mortal monk char? You just came, and say that you'll recode 
the guild. In wich way? What area your aims? Why do you think
that this guild needs to be recoded? We, mortals are playing with
it, so want to hear more about this recoding.
How do you like to be the guild? Which will be the most important
stats? How will unbalance this the guild?
Post and we'll post too our opinions.

BTW - seeing as Raindell is far too modest to announce this himself..

Raindell is Ass Monk GM.

ASSISSTANT even.

Raindell is NOT an Ass.

And he was a player monk :-)

Red, assistant only has 3 s'es...

For everyone else, I am also an assistant so I will still be working
to improve the guild. I've just turned the reigns over to Tinman. :)

I have played monks as well btw. (but not with this character. :)

Sauron
[tinman         ] [Apr  9] [response                                     ]

to your questions: Yes i played a monk before in fact i was
known was Jaer before.  First monk legend :) 
and the guild is being revamped so all skills system
is taken out.  which mangla told us that we will have a skill
system soon. but want all the guild to get standardized first
therefore we have to remove the skill system.  

We are trying to make the guild more right.  No silly commands
for now.  Some commands will have to be taken out because it doesn't
fit in to shaolin monk.  for example grill and hide will
be taken out.  Monk doesn't hide. 

Well this guild need to be recoded and balanced.  and the fact that
some skill is totally out of the monks ability that's why it need to be standardized
and also whisky's code :p you don't want to see it.  As for area,
Sauron is making a new guild area for the monk :)

Anyway as of monk status:
GM: Tinman
AGM: Raindell
     Sauron
Protector: Widge
for now.

Tinman
btw i won't be able to code that much this week and next week
therefore it's delaying the new soul to be installed.  
sorry for the temporary inactivity.  cuz by school work :p
figures.
[teapot         ] [Apr 13] [Re: response                                 ]

i'm not sure how this works, exactly...  i'm guessing that those who
were guild protectors aren't anymore.  i was one, and would like to
continue to be one if that is at all possible.  does my past as a 
teenage mutant ninja turtle help?
that's all from me for now...
here's hopin'!
