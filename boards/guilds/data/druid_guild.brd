i have a couple ideas for new spells:)  How about summon elementals:)
it would be like the ideas of the reapers and djinnis we used to have
but level depending, we could summon water, ice, earth, fire, wind, etc...
anything nature related to do a few attacks and take a few hits for us
since we usually have low hps:(  Or even something like summon scorpions
like i saw in a game warcraft one of my friends has:)  Just a couple

Summoners guild (extinct) had the ability to summon elementals.
Since they are gone, it would make sense for that ability to fall to druids
[wilbie         ] [Jan  7] [Re: Elementals                               ]

Yea...  I hear word that the Elementals are bored.
[tatsuo         ] [Jan  8] [summoners                                    ]

makes more sense to put the summoners back in

Tatsuo does have a point.
[blackmajik     ] [Jan 13] [Re: summoners                                ]

yes he does:)  But i would also like a gm that is here
once in a while and more players:)  and more fighting areas!
and the ninja guild reopened!...and .... sorry:(  got carried away:)

[turbo          ] [Jan 14] [THEY AGREE?                                  ]

Wow.  When Exos and Tatsuo agree on something, 
it must be a good idea.
[wilbie         ] [Jan 14] [Re: THEY AGREE?                              ]

Either that, or one of them has been taken over by aliens.
[sargon         ] [Jan 15] [Re: THEY AGREE?                              ]

Either that or its doubly silly.
[thumper        ] [Jan 16] [Time to worry                                ]

Well kiddies (sargon excluded) it would seem that Tatsuo
and Exos do in fact agree but why?  I mean I hate to be a party
pooper,but until we actually get some people back to HM the point
is not worth the direction it is aimed.  Now maybe this agreeing
thingy has something to do with Exos seeing that someone here 
has a brain, and codes better than most Sages.  Oh well
just a guess.  Tis late and I am tired bye!
[exos           ] [Jan 16] [Re: Time to worry                            ]

Sargon codes better than most Sages here.
So what is your point?
[creslin        ] [Feb 17] [Very bad time                                ]

Hi everyone
Times being bad for HM, nobody wrote any note for one whole month.
Can't imagine that 2 or three years ago. And I am here to wish
all your guys a late happy Chinese New Year.

Hey look at that....a note the very next day :)

I think it would be great if the summoners returned.
is this a rumor or something that may come to pass?

[exos           ] [Feb 18] [Re: Very bad time                            ]

Summoners....

Ahh yes a fun little guild from days past.
I cannot say much, all I can say is tehre is a chance of it returning.
However, we have open guilds that need work first.
Bare with me...I'll see if I can fix that one too!
[satia          ] [Mar 17] [Anyone?                                      ]

Hello?????  Anyone out there?  
Sometimes I feel like I am the only druid left
on here.
Here is a question for you all(wizards/arches):
Who is our GM?  I was just wondering because
our help legendlevels has never worked and I recall telling
Mangla and he said that was for the GM to fix.
Also, the long standing bug with the headband....can someone
make that thing dest when we drop it....I hate
to clutter around useless headbands when I go linkdead.
Thanks
Satia
[wilbie         ] [Mar 17] [Re: Anyone?                                  ]

I believe Shadowmonk is going to be the new GM.

I have returned from a long absent. I hope we can get this guild back 
to the way it was.
