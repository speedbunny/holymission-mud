[kripptik       ] [Nov  5] [Stuck                                        ]

Just east of the theive's contest room I am stuck. I am getting an error message when I try to go back north to the front room.  I can't steal or cheat or lie if I'm confined to 2 rooms. I've already posted a bug message and so I thought I'd complain to you all for a while.**
[kripptik       ] [Nov  5] [oops, made a mistake                         ]

In my last message I said east of the contest room, I meant to say WEST.
[mangla         ] [Nov 13] [Re: Stuck                                    ]

the problem was not fixed. I'm stuck again
[mangla         ] [Nov 16] [Re: its not fixed                            ]

Can you give me more details? I am unable to reproduce
the error. I went to the guild room and then west. No error.
Was tehre something else you did?

[mangla         ] [Nov 16] [Re: its not fixed                            ]

Ok fixed. :)

If you have bugs like that, let me know from where to where you
went, and I can much more easily track it down. Hopefully
that is the last one though...

Doesn't bode well for your college if you graduated and now have nothing 
to do in the mornings;)

Maybe you went to night school.

Why would I want to crawl under a rock?
I was not raised like you, I prefer a house with
doors and windows.

Ya know, after being a thief for that long, one would think you might be
expected to be able to spell it by now  ;)
[oscar          ] [Jan 25] [ok so what                                   ]

So I can't spell all that well...especially when I am typing 60+ words a minute. Figgy your not so great yourself ya know...

[paranoi        ] [Feb 11] [hehe                                         ]

its nice to return back after some months and see

[majik          ] [Feb 27] [abilities                                    ]

I read a posting in the mage guild by thundrak.  I agreed with
pretty much all he said.  Our mud used to rock when we had areas
like mortal combat and the wolverine, etc...  We also used to be
able to kick some serious a** with abilities like Slay the Living,
which should be called hug the living now, thieves had ambush, I
understand why it was taken out but we need some sort of new
abilities, the barbarian guild was impossible to beat in the arena
because of their 100 attacks per round but they were cool to fight
with, the vags had some sweet spells, the mages had teleport and
meteor swarm, the ninja guild just rocked and the samurai was the
best guild in the game but was removed.  Why did all these things
happen?  Is there any way we could get a lot of these abilities
back?  I like the idea of clans!  And i like the job the wizzes are 
doing to improve things!  The Bard guild is awesome now and there
is a couple of new areas to explore.  Keep up the good work and 
maybe we can get back to our days of the old.  Is there any way 
that we can have some wizzes work on new areas and bugged areas
and others work on the guilds.  And how about clan wars....Like
the arena but have it for an hour or 20 minutes at a time throughout the
mud:)  We wouldn't lose stats like in the arena but it is a way to get 
some friendly rivalry going and drawing some new peeps here:)
Make a rule that you can't kill less than 10 levels below you and
legends can only kill other legends:)  Just a few thoughts from someone
who has been here for about 6 years:)

[wilbie         ] [Mar  1] [why stuff is gone/weakened                   ]

Mortal Kombat - poorly coded, bugged to hell.
Wolverine - Not sure, but I believe it's being re-done.
Slay Living - People abused it.  Way too easy insta-kill.
Meteor Swarm - Abuse.
Barbarian - GM left.  New GM made some changes, then left.
Ninja - Back to former glory in a few days!
Samurai - It was still in testing stage when Tatsuo left.

I like your ideas for PK!
[redsexy        ] [Mar 11] [Disguise fixed                               ]

what is this?!!? Good, long-time thieves have left...
for the NINJA GUILD?!?!! My God, what has this ud come 
to when people once again follow Tatsuo!?!? 

Looks like time to recruit more thieves!! 

VIVA LA THIEVES!!!

[brainsprain    ] [Mar 25] [good news!                                   ]

Poison has been fixed, you will find that it should work well.
If you notice any bugs let me know.  I will be coding some additional
guild abilities in the next week, so if you have any ideas, let me know.

[braintest      ] [Mar 25] [Steal                                        ]

Ok, I just recoded steal a little bit.
Here is the new deal.  Legend level thieves can now steal worn objects.
Before you get all excited, keep in mind that it wouldnt make much
sense for you to be able to steal a breast plate off of a creature
so you can only steal small objects.  Go ahead, test it out legend thieves
any bugs, should of course, be noted here or mailed directly to me.

Have fun, if you have any suggestions let me know.

The sprained brain
[brainsprain    ] [Apr  4] [to griffon and others                        ]

Griffon told me yesterday that there was a problem getting
into the guild from under city.  Well, the problem is not with
undercity as i first thoguht, but actually is something
that both grif and i forgot to check.  Remember there
is two ways you can disguise, diguise title and disguise appearance.
I am going to try to get the tunnel under the thieves guild to 
query for your real guild so that you do not have to change
your appearance to get in, but i am not sure i can get that...
will see what i can do,.

In te meantime, remember to change both appearance and title in order
to be considered part of any guild....

Btw, what would you think about e combining both 
abilities into 1?

The sprain
[brainsprain    ] [Apr  6] [thief guides                                 ]

  There is an openning for another thief guide.  You must be a legend
level thief and must be very experienced with
the mud.  A thief guide is expected to help all other thieves whenever
they need it.  They will also have a very special ability, the ability to banish
an errant thief for breaking the thief code.  A banished thief
will not be allowed in the hideout and will be treated as
a member of any other guild while banished.  The thief guides
or the GM will be in charge of reinstating the thief.  In other
words you will be the sheriff of the guild, the only law in 
a lawless group.

Disclaimer: All banishments are subject to change by the
GM at any time.  Those caught abusing the ability to banish will
be removed as thief guides and banished themselves.

Brainsprain.
