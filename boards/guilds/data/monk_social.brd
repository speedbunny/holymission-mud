Welcome to a new room in the guild. :)

I hope you enjoy both the room (such as it is :) and the idea behind it,
and that you all continue to enjoy playing in the guild. I am nearing the
end of my current lib projects, and plan to take some time to write an
entirely new guild area. Until then, please continue to post about any bugs or
ideas to the appropriate boards, and have fun! :)

Your GM

Well, as you will hopefully have seen when you entered the room, there's
alot of equip here... just doing my bit to help out. Only thing I ask is
that you stick to the guidelines as Sauron already said, and that if you
don't need the money, please return the items here for others to use
rather than just selling them. Money is very easy to come by (ask me if
you need suggestions for 'high money' areas) and it's much nicer to have
equipment for all to use and enjoy.

Good idea Dredd.  My suggestion is that if you don't need the coins
drop unwearable equiptment here for those that need it to sell.  Also,
its also a very good idea to never sell a really good weapon but
rather drop it here.  
Have fun.

I like the idea with the eqquiment (to drop it here)!

do we really need a new guild area?
I kindof like it, reminds me of the old times.
Otherwise, i've heared that we are getting depowered in the process of balancing guilds. Is that true?

I like the guild this way it is, and this room could be a very nice place
too, if it could function. Noone ever used it - as I know... I usu. drop
my eq at the church, because never ever comes here to search for eq...
But it would be a good idea. The problem is that higher level monks
dont care, they can get weapons anyway - I can get them now too :) -
in a reasonable time. But lower level monks would need it, I felt
that on my skin... 
I also heard about depowering... I heard we would loose death, choke,
etc most of our offensive abilities... and I think its a hell of a bad
idea. I dont want to be a member of a praying and mumbling guild. I
wanna be a _real_ monk, not a praying and healing only weakling.

Dost fral, Allsiante Vell Engwar.
