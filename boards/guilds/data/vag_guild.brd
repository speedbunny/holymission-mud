theme, sturcture of the guild... 

I will stay on as Guild Development Consultant, to make sure that

Also, My Guild Status will "Retired GM"...

hi guys... just a quick note to let you know that
Tinman and I (and a few others...) are in the process of reviewing
and redoing things... so let us know what works, what doesnt,
and what sort of things you'd like to see happening soon.

also, any typos or things that you see, be sure to report them.

and most of all- HAVE FUN!!!

Since the omni was taken out (which is a good thing) the vags either a faster recharge on sp and 
a good healing spell. The only one good thing about the omni was the light feature that definitely saved me alot
of money and my life on occasion so that might be needed again

Well that's it for now

What we are thinking.  We are going to create new
spells and skills for u guys.  Some of which are
1. haste
2. slow
that would fit into vagabond more easily :)
anyway if you have suggestions.  write a note here.
I will be away for spring break so i guess the vagabond
will be stuck for a week or maybe if nae codes something
*grin nae*  :)

[countvlad      ] [Mar 28] [Healing Spell                                ]


This is something we definitely need since the omni is no longer. Release soul is great 
but when you don't have anymore corpses you have to rely on potions. 
so we're going to need a healing spell to compliment release soul

Easier solution, Never fight. Always willing to lend a hand.

Please don't copy the mage spell haste.
At least be more original on the name :)

In other news....I thought up a good new spell for Vagabonds...
(High level)....Time Stop...basically freezes EVERYONE in room but the vag
for a bit.  Really good when surrounded by masses of aggressive mobs.
[turbo          ] [Mar 28] [Time Stop                                    ]

an area affect hold?  COOl.
I figured that would get laughed right out the door.
Better make it not target players... or at least not initiate a fight.
[nylakoorub     ] [Mar 28] [re: timelords                                ]

No... Timelords are reversed for the clan, if that is still
being used...

[nylakoorub     ] [Mar 28] [re: timelords                                ]

No...   Timelords name is reserved for the Timelord Clan
if the clan system is still in place and going to be used
