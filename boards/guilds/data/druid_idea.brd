Heya Sourcer,
     I noticed a bug with consider. If you consider something that isn't
in the room instead of saying,'Never here when needed...' Or something like
that I got this big bug message I'll write it down for you in next note.
Keep up the good work. :)

Are there plans to put in a Stoneskin spell?
Just wondering since we already have barkskin.
Thanks. :)

[sourcer        ] [May 14] [re: stoneskin                                ]

Nope, i don't intend to make the ston-skin available
cause that's a mages-feature, but there will be some
better "barkskin" for higher levels soon (after the coding-stop)

Hi ,

I have been playing only for some days now, but I ve been a druid since long.
So my problem is I think cause critic is really a bad spell 
because it misses so often that I really cant rely on it...
I noticed cause light and cause serious also dont come off
sometimes, but thats balanced as it seems to me...
But this cause critic is really a suicidal spell as it always
fails :( Could something be done about it ?
(And also entangle is unreliable and strange a bit)

Thanks for attention

[arrigar        ] [Jun 26] [idea:  dispell                               ]

How about a spell to dispel all spells effecting the caster?
The reason for this is two-fold.  First, since a fireshield
of the wrong sort makes you more vulnerable to attack, it
would be nice to be able to switch fireshields without having
to sit around and wait for the old one to wear off.  Secondly,
I have had some annoying players cast 'faery fire' on me, this
spell lasts a long time.  The only way to get rid of it any
sooner is to log off and back on.  Just a suggestion.

Hmm....

We have already thought of a dispel magic here but as it seems
it is impossible to realise it. There are a lot shadows
in the game and you can't tell what is a spell and what is a ability.

sorry.

[sourcer        ] [Jun 26] [re: cause crit                               ]

Hello...

I can asure you there is NO difference between the 4 touch-spells
(cause l, ser, crit and harm). he only thing that differs is the 
level of the monsters you are attacking. The higher the mob, the
harder to touch. I know this is unfair but the spell-system
will change in near future.

i have an idea for the guild!!!!:)   we could have an invisibility spell 
to protect ourselves against aggressive monsters!!!!  We can become
one with nature....kind of like a camoflage!!!!   let me know what you 
think of the idea and maybe it will be put in:)

Hi all DRUIDS !!!

I think, this can be a verry good idea, a spell like a camelion or something in this way. 
Maybe its a idea for the new HM, hmm ??

[screwball      ] [Dec 12] [wow!                                         ]

I guess this board isn't visited very often (myself included).  Anyway,
with all the changes going on with the old HM, I'd like to know if the
guild is being changed in any way.  Are we gaining power? getting 
depowered? what?  Anyway, that's about all I'd like to know.
[sereph         ] [Apr 30] [a few ideas from a newbie                    ]

Real quick some things in this guild seem kind of pointless. For example
refresh and entagel for the 2 most obvious. If we are nature why not
give us a camelion where we can hide or something like that? So fuck me
for a strange idea but it makes sense to me

[hrun           ] [Jun 18] [lessons?                                     ]

Uh, do we normally get practice lessons for legend levels? 'cause i don't, i'm out of lessons, and a load of spells aren't maxed yet. Even more import
Even more important: How can i learn the slay this way?
Will i ever be able to now?
Thanks (i hope), Hrun
[sereph         ] [Jun 22] [ideas                                        ]

Rumor has it there are going to be some changes to this guild. Not
that I know alot but maybe I have a few that could be considered.
First of all possibly fix the heal minor it flat out doesn't work.
Then for some new things we could possibly eliminate refresh and
detect invis. With the detect invis. gone lower true sight to
like lvl. 15 or something. Then as I mentioned before possibly a
cameleon in order to hide. Almost foregot fix entangle we need it.
Another possible idea maybe tame nature which would work like
fast talk. And possibly for legend lvls. the idea of necromancy.
These could all be far fetched but I figure we need something.

Hi all,

How bout some rooms that are only for people of the druid persuation??
Other guilds have rooms with guards or are tossed back to the church
like in the fighter's guild..

You could put the donation room in there (i seem to recall a note on
this board about a donation room.  I have seen a donation room on
another mud and it worked by having a sort of balance for each guild
member and you could go down to -20 if needed.  Each time you donated
an item that was deemed worthy by the operator of the donation room,
you were given 1 donation point and each time you borrowed, it was
reduced by 1.  Then the higher levels players could donate their eq
instead of selling it and it helps out the lower levels....

You may want to have higher level eq cost more donation points or something
but what do you guys think of it?

Hi all, me again!

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if the entangle spell causes vines to grow
up and entangle the victim, shouldn't it keep them from walking out of
the room??  I'm not sure if they can flee...i will check and see, but
i entangled the Yellow Goblin and he walked out of the room.  When I
tried to entangle him again, he was still entangled!
