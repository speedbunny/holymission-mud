I dont get along with many people here because everyone here is a 
loser...seriously there aresome exceptions snot mnay that have
lives outside this place but the rest of you are so damn boring that I dont like wasting my
time chatting with any of you.  I like to surround myself with 
those of intelligence and prestige, most people here do not possess
such qualities, going no where witb thier lioves and so on.

So you cann all kiss my ass...I could give 2 shits aboput anything that
that goes on around here, RL people is what coubnts!!!!  Read RED's falme she
sghe is absolutley rigth about all of you... I come on here to chat,
playing sucks, no offense but the shit here just sucks and so do most 
of you.


I've stated my opinion....

Hey redlego..maybe we're all really kewl people..and maybe your the total loser??ever think of that??

Nah, i think that concept is too far advanced for her limited brainpower
to grasp.  She can barely even type properly, or keep a simple
topic going in a message.
[redlego        ] [Dec  6] [brent                                        ]

yo shut the fuck up, i just happen to type fast and i dont bother going
over the typos because i dont fell its necessary.  Get a fucking life

Last time i checked, this was part of my life...
An incredilbly busy one, which now involves insulting people who insist on
bitching and moaning and insulting other people who are trying to have
a good time. So if you don't like the people on here, yer always more
than welcome to take yer fucking holier-than-though, loser, illiterate
self somewhere else and pester them

If ya need some help in not logging on here, ask an arch to either
banish your char, or site ban you.
Have a rotten, miserable existance, asswipe.

What's the use of this discussion. Redlego doesn't think much
of other players... so? Starting a discussion with such a person
will only trigger a mental weakspot, resulting in a strange
player called LeadEgo... or something

This is a public board. As long as decorum is followed it is fairly
open. If things get nasty though, they really should be moved
down to the player flame board.

Is it me or is cure wounds not working as well as it did not too long ago?  Have there been any chages made?

Cure has changed somewhat.  Its alignment dependant now.
Please post notes like this on the inner jedi guild board.

ya know I dont wander out to other guild rooms that much
but I lately I have been going to a few and let me tell you
redlego is really startin to piss me off
every board Ive read lately has either a note from her bitchin about everybody else
or it has some not complaining about her complaining about everybody
If she is as better than the rest of us then what the hell is she doing
spending her time here anyways?
[xirtam         ] [Jun 28] [you guys all bitch too much!!                ]


  Of course that is very hypocritical of me to say - bitching about
all of your bitching - ya think?? Oh well - just wanted to throw in 
my two sense.  Or is that second cents??  I don't know
sometimes...........Muhaha laters...........

[shade          ] [Jul  3] [no big deal..                                ]

I don't see why anyone gets upset about people who spend their time
flaming each other... Anyone who is going to waste time being unhappy with 
something that they can avoid deserves the misery they get.  If 
people want to be miserable here, let them!  it ain't gonna ruin my fun 
any unless they have a problem with me personally.  if that is the case, let them take it up with me face to face..
Otherwise, i'm gonna ignore these pitiful cries for attention..

As long as i'm posting, let me plug the Jedi guild.
Here are some reasons to join.
1. You get a long vibrating wand to play with.
2. You can see in the dark;)
3. You'll know what everyone's thinking.

More to come later.

[icehouse       ] [Mar 17] [reasons not to join this guild               ]
