for those of you who don't like bard singing, just be thankful the bandana
in Ptaience's dir is restricted access.  It sang to the whole mud.  
Singing wouldnt be so bad if Mr. Exos would put in some new songs.   
How about some Christmas songs?

Oh, and Tetsuhara, if you think this board is seldom posted on, 
you should see the bard's board ... if you could ... 
and as long as we're adding new abilites to guilds, 
I'd love to see the mud crashing skill otherwise known as "Play country music" installed

We have another board for posting flames.
I was once told by a person much smarter than you and I
that the reason people swear is because they are making
a feeble attempt at expressing something that could easily be
expressed in a more direct way with the words that the
swearer doesn't know.
Since i don't have the access to delete someone elses notes
i'll post here to any elder or arch to please rm the above note.

Please leave Myxlplic's post up until someone can figure out what the
heck he's trying to say.  Anybody know a good cryptographer??

heh.... glad to see everyone is using the board again.....
flaming, yammering, etc, etc, etc.......
if you'd like turbo, i could come to the bards board and write
some shite :)

[myxlplic       ] [Dec 21] [well at least it worked...                   ]


 It is nice to see that some people take the time to leave notes.
Even a bad note is better than having none at all, lest we want 
someone poking us with a stick to see if we're still alive
(the mud, that is).  Show a little enthusiasm - you might just 
find it rewarding!

- oh and with regards to sargon's "lets not swear - it hurts my 
ears" comment, only 1 thing need be said - Whatever?!?

[sargon         ] [Dec 21] [Re: well at least it worked...               ]

I didn't say it hurts my ears...what I said is that it makes
you look feeble.   We don't want any Jedi to look feeble do we?

Does anyone know where to find better than "average" protection.  Ive tried wearing several different things in combinate, but the best I get is "average".OD.
Any thoughts?

[sargon         ] [Jan 24] [Re: armour                                   ]

Yea, i know where some really good stuff is.

[tetsuhara      ] [Jan 24] [ armor                                       ]

yes.... try the following
coldriks platemail and shield
dark lords amulet and helmet
firte leggings (from monk near dark lord)
gathans boots and gloves
that will give you excellent protection.....

A word of advice to all jedi.

That swirling mass of light at the end of the corridor?

Look VERY closely at it.

The word cast will no longer be needed in front of
your delayed command. I will work on updating the
