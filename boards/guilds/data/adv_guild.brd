Does this also mean we gotta go around calling people "Chap"
and change the thing in the church to a "lift"?

I draw the line at having to eat anything the two Fat ladies
might have created.

[redsexy        ] [Mar 21] [SUMMONER PLAYTESTING                         ]

All on the Holy Mission are invited to come and join the Summoner Guild
as playtesters.  A variety of low and high levels players are
required to make sure the guild is fully functional before the
grand opening.

Four playtesters will be in place for a period of one week.
They will be expected to moan at me constantly to make the guild
overpowered and boast meaninglessly to other players that
they are Summoners.

There may be bugs.  If a playtester dies as a direct result of
a guildbug, they will be compensated.  If a playtester dies
through their own desire to "try something big" they will
be laughed at.

After a period of one weeks playtesting, the players will be
given the opportunity to return to their own guild.
Any other players may join Summoner without penalty during
the first week of opening.

The guild rooms are now open on the MUD.  I wish everyone
the best of luck in finding these.

All enquiries from those interested in playtesting and those
who are considering becoming a Summoner should be directed
to me through MUDmail or in person.

Redsexy,

I will try to have arenas whenever I am on and I have people on.
Unfortunately I have a fulltime job among other RL issues that
keep me away from here.

Seems as if the old myths and legends are true. Recently you
have seen some memebers of this revered guild walking around
the town. I would like to officially announce that I have
checked into this matter and they really are open and
excepting new application! Now, if only you can find out where
thier headquarters is hiding...

My mentor has asked that I think over my decision to leave, and having done so, 
I realised that leaving would make Demolian WAY TOO happy,
therefore I will be staying until I am thown out.

Me reckons it was just an excuse to give us his ICQ# and

thanks to whoever sent me email concerning HM,

I've forwarded them to mangla, because I dont want to mess
with politics here.
[mangla         ] [Apr  7] [Re: mails                                    ]

I noticed one alarming thing in these mails that needs to be
cleared up. We have no intention of moving HM from here. I have
talked to Herp and he is aware we are TESTING on a different
box on a new lib. This lib is based of the HM lib with some
improvements that we think you will enjoy. This test box just
means that we will not have to break things here when testing.
HM will remain in Austria. Well it will unless NATO decides
that Austria has done something wrong. ;)

[herp           ] [Apr  9] [ about recent emails                         ]

hi,

recently, I got a lot of emails concerning HM.
be aware, that, if I recognize after a few lines the email has
nothing to do with my RL-work, but adresses MUD-problems instead,
I'll forward them to the administrators here.

especially those player named "Mark" IRL:

) I cannot believe you just took all that effort and risk I 
) put into writing my letter and passed it on to the very 
) person I am complaining about.  

should be aware that I don't read 345 lines of email concerning
HM-politics. *if* you are complaining about Mangla, then you'd
better do that in the first three, four lines ... else I miss
everything of it.

To make a simple statement: I am not interested in politics.
Than you,
Herp
