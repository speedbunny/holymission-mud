We are very few around. But if the guild will be fixed up
I think will came new guild members.
Thanks for working on the guild.

Resistance to bathing?

The barbarian guild is very poor now.
Here I my ideas to restore it in it's old glory.
The combat abilities needs increased. I'm legend 1
now, but cannot kill wuki without running away and
healing myself. I don't think that any other guild
member legend needs healing to kill wuki.
We have a lot of hp, and nothing else.
We may have some dodge skill, like now is the
toughness, but much better - consider, the fighters 
can parry, we can't.
For sacrificing magic items we can get some magic 
resistance, and for sacrificing some special items
resistance against poison. 
We may have a guild quest for a specific good guild
armour (kodiak bear fr) and/or guild guild weapon or skill.
GO BARBARIANS!!
I'll help in the restoring of the guild if you want 
with other ideas or with testing new abilities.

Hi guys

I'm your new GM. Having taken over and had the code
moved into my dir the first thing I want to do is stabilise
everything. What this emans is that I want to reserve the next
7 days for solving any teething problems which arise from having
moved the code into my dir.
So don't expect any breathtaking advances in that time
If things are stable by then, ie no bugs, then I will start screwing
with the code in an attempt to make the guild more interesting and
fun toplay.

So what I'm asking is: Please bear with me till next Sunday evening
as I want to make sure we are bug free before I start playing
with your code. Then we can talk about ways we can improve the
guild.

Please note: You are NOT getting a hold spell so don't ask for one.

D,
There is an error in prepapre.c at line 51
This means we cannot use barb combat at the moment.
Beware if you try to prepare, you will lose the SP.
Exos has had a quick look at it, and so it is best nobody tries it until Darastor can get in to fix it.

You'll notice if you use "barb" with no arg, the output looks different
to the way it always used to. Now it is consistent with the chat lines
of the other guilds...I have done this because it was requested by an
arch.
