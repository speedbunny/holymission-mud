[exos           ] [Jan 27] [orbs                                         ]

I have changed summon orb...

Orbs now cost less sp and do less damage.
However, you'll notice that you can cast MORE orbs than before,
so you can actually do MORE damage for the same amount of SP!

For you lucky legends...you can now cast black orbs for 150 instead of 750!
(Yes that means you can cast 5 when you used to cast 1....LOTS more damage!)
[exos           ] [Jan 27] [Beggar Gold                                  ]

This is an old and unused command.
It has been removed.
[exos           ] [Jan 27] [Banshee Wail                                 ]

This spell has been changed.  It now costs 100 sp,
but is now an area attack spell considerably more powerful
than pyrotechnics.

[exos           ] [Jan 27] [possible future changes                      ]

Possible change...when high level bards cast low-level orbs,
possible to do more orbs.  Do you like this idea?

Any other ideas for the guild?
[exos           ] [Feb  3] [Irish Luck                                   ]

A new spell for low level bards.
Try it, I think you'll like it.

(It also works on other players!)
[exos           ] [Feb  3] [Intoxication                                 ]

Intoxication has been removed.  It was seldom used
and not as effective as initially planned.  Look for
a replacement soon!
[exos           ] [Feb  3] [Heart Glow                                   ]

Ok...I'm on a roll.

Heart Glow is now in.  Its the new Intoxication replacement.
A nice little spell that you can use to heal other players, or
yourself if need be!

Be aware, Taliesin decided he likes to wander more.
He got bored with the old town pub!
[wilbie         ] [Feb  4] [Re: Taliesin                                 ]

Yea, that Pub has really degraded over the years.  I hear they water
down the stout.
[exos           ] [Feb  6] [Re: Taliesin                                 ]

Ya its a wonder the major still stays there.
[wilbie         ] [Feb  6] [Re: Taliesin                                 ]

The major is senile.  He doesn't even know he's there.
[sargon         ] [Feb  7] [Re: Taliesin                                 ]

Thats right.  The best part of being senile is all the people you
meet.
[turbo          ] [Feb 28] [Songs                                        ]

The list of songs has changed, but Pepper is still the longest ( 81 lines).
Bohemian Rhapsody is a close second though (65 lines)
[bobo           ] [Feb 28] [Re: Songs                                    ]

So that means that pepper is the most annoying, 
bohemian Rhapsody is a close second though.
[turbo          ] [Feb 28] [American Pie                                 ]

I could always add American Pie, or I'd Do Anything for Love ...
[turbo          ] [Mar  8] [Songs update                                 ]

I have been given access to the songs.
I have updated the 'songs' list (as soon as Exos moves the file anyway).
I take requests.
