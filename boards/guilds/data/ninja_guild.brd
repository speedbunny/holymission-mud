[tatsuo         ] [Mar 18] [SHIDOSHI                                     ]


The Player leader of the ninja will be known as the Shidoshi, and he
will carry the Katana of the Shidoshi in place of a daito.
This player is the most powerful ninja in the guild, and must answer
for the actions of all guild members.  The Shidoshi will also have
special extralook when you look at him/her, a ninja line title, and
a personal room in the guild.  The shidoshi can be challenged by any member
of the guild who wishes to claim the position.

To become Shidoshi:

1. You must have earned at least one Daito by defeating the mighty Ryu.
2. You must post a challenge on the board
3. The Shidoshi must agree on time of fight with challenger and arrange
   for Wilbie-sama or Tatsuo-sama to be present.
4.  When both participants signal they are ready, they wilbie moved into
   a combat room with no exits and they will fight to the death.
5.  The winner is the shidoshi.  If the shidoshi falls, the challenger will
    take his blade, and assume the post.
6.  The old shidoshi must wait 2 challenges to rise again, or after
     such time as Wilbie-sama and Tatsuo-sama deem is long enough.

Have fun,

BTW: The current Shidoshi is Nobunaga

I post the guild quest on the san board, I answer
the questions.
I wrote that the ryu is very dangerous, and take care yourself
don't be killed. I wrote all special attacks of him, even the poison.
once again: TAKE CARE YOURSELF, DON'T BE KILLED IN THE QUEST!!!
Read the description carefully, and consider before try to kill him.
You can kill him, for me (legend 1) didn't took more
then 1 our to kill the ryu (killed him twice). Think before attack
him how can use your skills in the best way against the beast.
Good luck, don't forget, the quest is VERY dangerous.
Dorr

P.s.: damn, I'll have to kill the ryu again for the armour...

In the next few weeks a slow conversion into the 100 level system will
be attempted

5 new skills will be added above level 30
and some current skills will be stretched higher

Summoner will be also going 100 level, and then the rest of the guilds
as the GM's can catch up.

if you have questions, post.

Right now, the Ninja guild is between guildmasters.  Tatsuo is gone
at least for now, and I am not currently coding for the mud.  Either 
of these things may change.

I have suggested Bobo for the new GM.  He's good, and he knows the
guild.  As far as the guild itself, it is quite stable and should give
you no problems.  If there are bugs, report them as usual.

See you all around.

Hi!
There is not much activity on this board anymore.
Anyways here are some things that i wanted you to know.
Beware of fighters in the arena. I fought a legend 11 or something fighter
he blocked almost all of my karate attacks, he didnt howerver block
the fireshurikens, but as i'm unskilled at shadowmagic it didn't help me
much.
In Turbo's area there is a magic item that increases constitution by 2,
combined with prismatic armor this is quite nice. A fellow named Marcus
Cole has it, the item's name is ranger's pin or something. If you bring
a couple of strongly poisoned darts with you he dies quickly.

[wilbie         ] [Mar 31] [Re: some things                              ]

The ninja will of course lose to a fighter in a toe-to-toe slugfest.
Fighters are adept at such things.  Ninja are more adept to quick 
strikes and trickery.

Try assassinate to start things off.  Then, try to rush in, get off a
few fireshurikens, and then run out of the room.  Reapeat this a few
times.  You should have no problem with pesky fighters :)
[dorr           ] [Apr  1] [camouflage                                   ]

If I camouflage myself then I can assassinate just once, and
cannot camouflage for other five minutes. Why?
This means that even if I killed the monster I step out from the 
shadows, and cannot assassinate for a while.
I think this is wrong. We should be able to camouflage any 
time I think.

[darastor       ] [Apr  1] [Re: camouflage                               ]

I think Dorr has a point - a ninja should be able to camouflage
any time, but instead of stopping for a period after camoufglae,
a ninja should have to take time between issuing the "camouflage" command
and actually becoming camouflaged, since the time taken is really
n concealing oneself, not after the event.

[sargon         ] [Apr  1] [camouflage                                   ]

I think its logical that you can't camouflage on the same mob
twice int eh same fight.  But its also seems logical that
youcould be able to camouflage on a different mob (different
room as well) in a relatively short period of time.

  Sargon
[wilbie         ] [Apr  1] [Camouflage                                   ]

You can now camouflage to your hearts content.  By the way, the time 
limit was put in because of people abusing camouflage...  However, as 
long as people don't abuse it I see no reason for the limit.
[darastor       ] [Apr  1] [Re: Camouflage                               ]

Actually, although this is a side point, the delay was in there
originally in the code as written by Patience.
But as I said that's a side point, and the delay in that
way makes no sense.

However, since camouflage is an actual action, and to make oneself
camouflaged involves doing a little more than melting into the
shadows, I think that there should be a delay between actually
typing camouflage and becoming camouflaged.
Maybe also accompanied with a message such as "XYZ starts to camouflage
him/herself" when camouflage is typed.

Also, is camouflage prevented when in combat? It certainly should be
if it's not.

Just my opinion

[wilbie         ] [Apr  2] [Re: Camouflage                               ]

I don't think there needs to be a delay.  Thief has no delay for "hide".
[darastor       ] [Apr  2] [Re: Camouflage                               ]

Camouflaging and hiding are slightly different.
When you camouflage you have to actually try and make
yourself look like the surroundings...that's a bit
different to just hiding in shadows?

Or are you saying that the ninja camouflage ability is identical
in nature to the thief hide ability?

D

If it's identical to the thief hide ability then they have a delay
before they can hide again...why should that apply to thieves and not ninja?

[dorr           ] [Apr  2] [karate                                       ]

I'm grandmaster from Karate Jitsu, but still fail circa 30%
of my attacks. It's annoying. I understand that even the
grandmaster fails sometime, but not 30%, less then 10% shoul be.
Your opinion?
Dorr
[wilbie         ] [Apr  2] [Re: Camouflage                               ]

The camouflage skill is a combination of physical hiding and shadow
magic skill...  The fact that Ninja can hide immediately and more
often is balanced out by the fact that they lose spellpoints.

[wilbie         ] [Apr  2] [Re: karate                                   ]

How long has this been going on?  The way the skill is defined, 
you should be hitting about 88% of the time at grandmaster.
[wilbie         ] [Apr  2] [Skills                                       ]

You may notice some changes in how your skills are listed in "introduce".
Do not panic.  Your ability to use the skill has NOT changed, only the
wording used to describe the level.  For example, some of you who are 
"grandmaster" in a skill might see the skill listed as "o-sensei" now.

Introduce was based on the lower level system.  With people gaining 
legend levels (and therefore higher attributes) the skills are getting
higher than before.

Thanks for the suggestions and questions.  Keep them coming.
