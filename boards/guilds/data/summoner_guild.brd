[redsexy        ] [Mar 21] [Summoners of Holy Mission - Welcome!         ]

Welcome to the Summoner Guild of Holy Mission.  Our history is a vast and
intricate one, spanning many ages, I suggest you read our guild book and
familiarise yourself with the legend.

Summoner is an elitist guild.  We do not tell any of our secrets to the
outside world, and we even treat those in our number with suspicion.
Newbies will not normally be allowed to join the guild without a formal inrtoduciton
to the Guild Master.  Of course, there may be newbies who find their way to
the guild all by themselves.  They should be vetted carefully before anything
is entrusted to them.

It is an old guild, and as such, some things may just crumble.  Please inform
me immediately if the roof crashes over your head.

I like a good laugh.

Your GM,

Redsexy

My four playtesters are in place.  Llllllisa and Kirill are testing the lower
end of the scale, with Demolain and Blackmajik looking after the higher.

Please note, all play testers have an L in their names and it is a rule I
will be strictly enforcing as the guild continues.  No L, No entry.

I think if a player logs off, their summons should disappear
also:)  LLLLLLISA's are still here even though she is gone:)
just wondered if that was a bug:)

I think we should get some more sps or at least have a brooch
with more points in it to start with.  I also think the arch
needs to be a bit more powerful.  I haven't found much difference
between the power elemental and arch-demo:(  Also, I think we
need to have some more spells as legends.  We should get a power
spell for attacking and maybe be able to command 4 beasts at
legend levels and maybe 5 as a legend 7 or 8 and 6 at legend
14 or 15:)  Just a couple of thoughts.  Also, mud should last a bit longer for the
amount of sps it costs:)    That's all for now:)  Off to fight
a bit more:)
Blackmajik the bug slayer:)

Also, in reference to the last note, I also think we should be
able to cast a spell for the first attack and be able to use
certain armours like the mage-masters robe, prismatic armour, 
jeweled earrings and wizards hat and weapons like the star bursts:)
Just a couple more thoughts:)
Blackmajik the always helping and thinking:)

Hello Summoners!

As you may or may not know there are one or two things that I am
holding back on until certain changes are made generally,
especially with regards to higher level skills.

However as far as I'm aware, these are the things I have to look
at:

1)  Golem not taking damage when fight in progress.
2)   Better percentage xp from beastie attacks.
3)   Changing some of the more popular magic armour for summoner
4)  Possibility of strength and haste spells for creatures.

With regards to the last point, I don't want Summoner to be seen
as the guild that has everything.  I will be putting some quests
into place eventually so higher levels can summon some really
mean monsters.  But, as I said before, this all depends on how
the MUD is going to change over the coming weeks.

Don't worry - I'm going to be as active as possible during this
time!  I have no plans to be one of these "unseen" GMs.  But try
to be patient with regards to changes unless they are major bugs.
Improvements will be made constantly but at a steady rate.

Please keep on bugging me!!!!

In my area, there are some armor-types.
Most of these are useable by everyone, including Summoners.
They aren't very pretty, but they work.

[llllllisa      ] [Mar 27] [Ideas                                        ]

Okay here are some ideas....

1) make Wisp not one of the creatures that you control.

2) For legends, maybe a task, quest, etc. to be able
to control some new kind of beast

,
3) more creatures for legends

4) differentiate attack spells a little bit
.
5) make the summoned creatures more unique so there
is a reason for still summoning lower level creatures
(eg. earth elementals occassionaly cast mud, fire
elementals cast smoke, water cast some sort of area
attack)
.
6) make mud last longer than 1 round

7) buy max in power shop fill up hp and sp too, so
we don't have to waste time transferring
.
8) some armors that have special qualities work
(gypsy earrings, maybe pris. armor, etc.)

9) change rloc so it has a chance of locating people
higher than you
,
10) some sort of guild recogntion when someone gains a
level (you sense that so and so has become more powerful
in the ways of summoning gaining knowledge yadda yadda)

.
1) maybe a record of who donates to the donation box??
(would encourage dontating....)

okay....some of my other ideas were already posted or
even taken care of...guess that's it for now :)

after reading the book, i thought of another idea....how bout instead
of just getting new spells and creatures at different levels, we
have to do something to gain th knowledge?  i realize this would
take a lot of coding.

Ok, I may be totally blind and stupid, but I don't see a pub-type area in

[redsexy        ] [Mar 27] [Re: Guild rooms idea                         ]

As out of character as this may seem for me, Summoner are not really
the drinking type.

Ack, and I try not to be hypocritical.

[redsexy        ] [Mar 27] [Re: Ideas                                    ]

WOW!!! llllllisa, you ROCK!  Those ideas are excellent, as you know
the level based stuff will have to be reviewed in line with
any changes made around here - the donation box record, max power
buy and wisp thing can be done relativelty quickly.

Quests will take some time, armours could be problematic till
I talk to someone with ownership rights and the spell stuff
will come as and when I get a chance.

Remember to remind me to email you llllllisa.

[redsexy        ] [Mar 28] [Re: Ideas                                    ]

OK two things done:

1) Willow the Wisp no longer counts towards one of your creatures.

If you have any problems with the light provided please let me know :-)

2)  List of donators in donation room.

Please note MY generous contribution.

That's all for now, am trying to work on a draw max but its a bitch.

[llllllisa      ] [Mar 30] [Legend Suggestion...                         ]

Here is a suggestion for legend ability.  how bout instead of some generic
arch-demon, we are allowed to "create" our own personal demon (after
we discover it through a series of adventures).  we could do something (again
adventures, knowledge, ?) in order to make this demon stronger, learn more
spells, etc etc.  when he dies, he only returns to his own plane,
so we can conjure the same demon again.

[demolian       ] [Mar 31] [Re: Ideas                                    ]

my only recommendations are:
added length for mud, for 50 hps, should last little longer (50 sps rather)

added mobs like llisa said, more for legends or
   more with quest solutions

or maybe same # of mobs, but they hit harder or more often at legends

I assume since llisa went up so quickly that low levels don't need 
too much assistance,

Oh, and i almost forgot, that hps/sps for legend thing
maybe it's not that important for other races, but 400 hp can be dangerous
for me, being a gnome with only a 20 con max.

[wilbie         ] [Apr  5] [Idea                                         ]

How about some quest demons that autoload?  They'd be sort of a personal
companion that would follow ONE summoner until they (or the summoner)
is killed.  Don't make 'em quite as powerful as the arch-demon
but make them not count against the creatures you summon...  That way
you have one extra critter than you normally can.  

In order to be fair, these demons would have to be REALLY INCREDIBLY
DIFFICULT to obtain.  Also, if they die in combat they will of course
NEVER serve you again... (They might even try to kill you)

Hi all - thanks for the input Wilbie sir :-)

As you may or may not know I am in the process of a total recode of Summoner
adding a logical progression to spells, legend level summons, improving a lot
of stuff that needs improving and taking into account everyone's suggestions.

The reason you're not seeing immediate changes is that I want everything to
go online at the same time.  Summoner guild will still be the same basically,
but with added kick ass funcitonality.

For the whole idea of Summoner quests, etc, I will be writing a Summoner area
and recoding Matt's New World area.  This will come after "New Summoner", and
for those of you who can beg, borrow or steal access to the wiz boards, I 
suggest you check out my long post about my long term plans.

Actually, if any of you have cut and paste - it'd be COOL if someone could
post that here.

Hope you're all still having fun with the guild.  Promise it'll get even
better.

[redsexy        ] [Apr  1] [Long term plans for Summoner                 ]


Hi, I thought I would take the time to write a constructive note instead of

ripping the hell out of everyone.  As you're probably all aware I'm very fond

of the Summoner Guild and I thought I'd enlighten you as to my plans over a 100

level system.



I see the guild moving away from the traditional spells/skills base of others
onto something totally different.  I'd like feedback if people think this is


going to work or not.

Now, how many of you have played any of the Final Fantasy games?  No,

neither have I but my main idea has been drawn from there.  Materia.
The Summoner guild after the traditional levels of 1-29 will become
materia based.
"So wtf is materia?" I hear some of you ask.  For the purposes of Holy

Mission materia is fragments of the prism lost around our world when it
exploded in the Summoner Wars.  When Genocyber restored the prism, fractions


remained hidden in the lands.


Materia drains energy slowly and randomly from the holder, feeding itself.

Eventually it reaches a break point.  When that break point is reached,

the holder can choose to activate the materia's special power.  After

activation, the materia is, of course, destroyed.


This is

 how I envision it working.  On joining Summoner, the player has

to choose an elemt to "train with" for the first 30 levels.  They will

receive either fire, water, earth or air materia which will stay with

them and have a special attack associated with it.  This materia will

never explode.  It is a symbol of their allegiance to that elemental.It

will reach a brak point perhaps once every two or three hours playtime.
After level 30 the Summoner can start making use of the other materia


hidden around the MUD.  There will be sixteen types of materia,

each with its own creature, spell or skill.  Some of these may take

days of playtime to activate and the breakpoint will be determined by

the holder's initial elemental choise.  There is a random chance the

materia may explode unexpectedly, or just not activate, but if

successfully used, it will bring devestation.


For example:

Materia type :         Robey.
Materia Spell:    Summon Titan
Activation     20,000 SP
Modifiers -
Fire        100%
More? [q to quit]
Water     100%
Earth     50%
Air     150%

hee hee, never try to format stuff in ZMUD


Titan Stats:   WC20 AC20 level 100.

Draws at:    100SP random every hour.


OK so that's THAT bit of the idea, now on to some stuff I'd like to see

added, not just for Summoner use, but which should be of benefit to every

guild.


I would like to see a property in room.c along the lines of set_surround.

I think this could make guilds a lot more interesting.  For example,

Barbarians could get a bonus for fighting in a desert, Druid in a forest,

thieves underground, etc.  Means adding one line of code to a



hell of a
lot of files, but with the amount of areas being developed right now I think

its a good time to be thinking about it.


I'd also like to see a set_element type in monster.c.  The advantages of this

being that spelldamage can be varied according to the type of spell used.

For example, attacking a dragon with an ice spell would be more effective

that attacking it with a fire spell.  Most magical guilds have a fire based

spell - or some kind of elemental attack.  Fire against ice giants should

rock.


These are VERY long term plans.  But I thought I'd let you all know

about now what I'm intending on busying myself with.


Comments, suggestions and harsh criticism welcome,



Redsexy
