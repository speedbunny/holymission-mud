[exos           ] [Mar 20] [Mage Guild                                   ]

Hello everyone.

I just wanted everyone to know, there will start to be major
changes here.  Expect an entirely new guild and spell system
very VERY shortly.  You will notice the return of some classic
spells, and the deletion of some unpopular spells.

Also new news...I have taken over as Mage GM, and have passed 
Bard GM onto Turbo.  So any questions or comments, may be posted
here and/or mailed to me directly.  I hope to have this guild
back into the powerhouse and loved guild it was back in the
days of Llort.

I welcome all constructive comments, recommendations, and
also general questions.

Your new GM,

Exos
[matrix         ] [Mar 24] [spells - suggestions......                   ]


  Just a few suggestions as I was around in the mage's glory days
..as you refer to the exos....

   Would very much like to see the prison spell come back (the orb).  It was very 
effective at keeping younger rookies in order.

  Also  the memorize site/ teleport spell.

  Maybe ever have 10 sites all around the mud 
  automatically memorized so we could "teleport 1" etc...

  Would like to see maybe a "heal" spell which could be used to heal 
us or those who fight with us (groups).
 
  how about an increas dex spell - like strength??

  thats it for now - i'll let ya know if i have 
any others.

    Mat.....out............

[exos           ] [Mar 24] [Re: spells - suggestions......               ]

I am not sure about prison spell yet.  Let me say it is a possibility.

Memorize and Teleport are both coming back.  You won't have access to 10
sites at the start (It is possible later)
Teleport will work one of 4 ways:

Teleport guild (replaces goguild), teleport mage to guild.
Teleport church, teleport mage to church.
Teleport memory, teleport mage to room "memorized"
Teleport back (replaces goback), teleport mage to room he/she last teleported FROM.

There won't be a heal spell.

Dex increaser is definite possibility.

Any other ideas, please post here.
I anticipate a list of the new spells being posted on here later tonight.

In my area, there are some armor-types.
Most of these are useable by everyone, including Mages.
They aren't very pretty, but they work.

The spellist looks nice. Here are some suggestions though.
The cost of magic missile is too high. A first level mage should be
able to cast a dozen of it. Generaly the costs are very high
considering that in the new level system you won't get sps for 
legendlevels (since there won't be any). I had about 320
(well, maybe it was 420, but that does not make much difference)
spellpoints before legending, so you should calculate the costs
according that. You put hold at a quite high level. It 
should be available to lower level mages, it's an essential spell.
Anyway, when does one get each spell level?
The spells i miss:
stafffeeble
illusion
(listed under skills right now)
and
faerie fire
(spell by llort, and it needs fixing too, it used to put 
(surrounded by a pink aura) behind the victim's name, 
and it doesn't do that now)
Color spray worths nothing right now, so please recode it.
As mages are very weak physicaly i'd like to see more protection 
spells. There could be at least one at each spellevel.
Ideas for protection spells:
Protection bubbleSummons an elastic globe of force around you that slows down the 
blows that hit it and reduces damage that you take.
Enchantment
This spell can be used to enchant an armor or a weapon. eg increase
ac wc.
 
I'd still like if the spell got their names after player mages.

[exos           ] [Mar 28] [Re: comments                                 ]

All of the spells have been recoded.
Color Spray is now the "low level" hold...
SP costs are tentative at this point.
I intend to SERIOUSLY raise the available SP to mages.

Faerie Fire and Illusion were 2 spells that were requested tobe removed
in favor of more beneficial spells.  They may return later.

As of right now, some had to leave to make room for older and better spells.

I am definitely up for new names and new spells.

As an aside on staff....staff is not a spell any longer, but it is now
a skill.  Skills take place immediately, no casting time required.
Other skills include memorize (for teleport), pose, mage line, visible...etc.
[ati            ] [Mar 29] [spellpoints                                  ]

Well, i welcome that you want to raise our spellpoint pool.
But do not raise it seriously, raise it moderately AND reduce
spellcosts moderately too. That'd have the same effect as increasing spellpoints seriously plus
it'd decrease the time needed to regain all your mana.

Is there a set maximum for number of spells that mages can have?
If not than why are two notso effective spells (i wouldn't say that
faerie fire is not effective though, it does lower the protection
of your opponent, and when you are grouped with a fighter and are
killing a monster with good protection like Coldrik, than it does make a difference)
removed in favor of some effective ones.
Oh and Illusion IS effective too, but i won't let you know how, well
not on the public board anyways.

[chers          ] [Mar 30] [suggestion:                                  ]

How about that:
Spells, which a mage can cast on his staff...spells which improve the staff...for example 'light' or something...that means that, as long as a mage keeps the staff (and if he / she casted light on it), he/she w would have light...but at the next login the mage needs again to cast the spells on the staff...

i think there should me spells like 'strength', 'light', 'haste', pro'protection' and so on ...but they should have a high cost...it should be enough, that a mage would say: yeah i cast it on my staff...although it would take the half of my mana orso...

Other new spells suggestions: Something like "Boeser Blick" (we call it in german)...if you cast this spells on a monster, you take control over it. You cant exactly control what the monster does, but it fights on your side, until the end of the fight...

Next time, i will make more sggestions...

-and one day the mages will return!-

There will be a longer than anticipated delay on mage guild.
I have some things I need to focus my attention on off the MUD.
I will still check in here to keep track of your ideas.
Hopefully this delay will not take too long.

Mages can feel free to post here, mudmail me, or even email ideas.
[ati            ] [Apr  2] [inner and outer rooms                        ]

Please restore the inner and outer circle rooms to their old state, the one
who
before the new tower, because as it is now is illogical. I write you down how
it should be. One teleports (goguild) in the inner room when above level 29, one
teleports to the outer room when over level 20 and not over 29, and teleports
to the research or mapping room belov level 20 ( there used to be a restroom ).
Oh, and one cannot go from the outer to the inner, but from the inner one can 
go to the outer.
who
And please remove that entrance to the inner in the mapping room ( push book).
It is very illogical to be able to enter our innermost circle just by moving a
book.

[exos           ] [Apr  3] [Re: inner and outer rooms                    ]

There will be no IMMEDIATE change to the mage tower itself.
The guild soul itself is far more vital.
There WILL be work done on the tower.  Again, please be patient
and bear with me.
[exos           ] [Apr  3] [More on spells                               ]

I can see a future of spells like "Agility" and "Stamina"

You will not see any spells that raise mental attributes (int,wis,cha).
You also will not see any healing spells.

With some future changes on their way, there will be more spells.
These changes may make my new spell system obsolete...so it may need
to be re-worked.  This will not cause a significant delay.

I am up for spell ideas.  NOTE: I Don't want to hear about spells
other guilsd have.  I Want original ideas.  Or open up your AD&D Player's
Handbook or your Palladium Fantasy main book, or your Rifts Federation
of Magic.  I can use spells out of there (Even if I do own them)

More soon!

Exos the summon room used to be at the top of the old mage tower.
IT was a place where you could go, draw a pentaram, and summon
creatures.  IT was a really great area, but note that there were
some serious bugs in it if you decide to reinstate it.

[exos           ] [Apr  4] [Re: summon room                              ]

Insteresting.

I'll have to see if the old file still exists.
If it is salvageable it may go back in.

The summon room was a great chamber consisting of 9 rooms (3*3 room square)
There was a book describing how to summon monsters.
You had to walk around the rooms drawing a pentagram with chalk. If there#
was alredy some drawing in a room you destroyed it when you entered, so
you had to be careful how to walk around. THan you said: 
yaczkl hruk dan monstername
and the named monster was summoned if it was loaded into memory. If the
protective pentagram was broken than i think it failed, or did the 
summoned monster attack? I think i never tryed. Nevertheless, you had
to stand in the middle of the pentagram during the summoning. The
summoned thing appeared there. Sometimes it attacked, but mostly not
( i think because i didn't try it on low levels with low stats)
Even such big monsters could be summoned successfully like grazzt, not
that he was any good. The best was sledge with his many many attacks and
(i think) lower level.
If the summoning was successful the monster followed you and did what
you ordered it to do.

The problem was you could summon ANYTHING the game has in it's memory. I
know of people that solved the haunter quest by summoning it!
[ati            ] [Apr  6] [re figleaf                                   ]

i think that you have to solve all the steps between to do that AND go in to haunter, so that it loads into memory ...

It's bugged. Didn't notice it untill now. I got attacked while being invis
and the opponent didnt have detect invis or similar magic.
So far I've been attacked with shieldbash (i think that's the name of the
fighter skill) and karate (ninja) while invis.
Oh and i think truesight should protect from backstab and assassinate
at least to some extent.
