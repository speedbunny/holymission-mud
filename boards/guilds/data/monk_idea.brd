If any of you are familiar with AD&D's Oriental cmpaign, you are familiar
with monk in it. I think it is a great way for our guild to go. There
are four different syles to choose from and each one has it's strengths
and weaknesses. I just remember that one of each of them had the ability
to be a strong technique. I remember the monk I played was very powerful.

Almost all guild have now a very cool, hard spell on high levels
(slay living, backstab, etc) so i think we should have one, too.
My idea is a simple change on the effect of the good old death skill.
It should cause very serious wounds on the victim, about DEX*LEVEL hp.

Thank you,
                Skyhawk

i think that monk comparing to most other giulds has gonnne be very week...
it is necesary to strength our skills for ex:hurting of a hit been * with the level!!!!!!
AND a new death !! not hurting!**

Hi Nuns, Monks and Nunks :)

I think we should have exclusive use of panthers. Other guilds are more
powerful than us, and they want pentagrams to get past bruce to get
a panther. I think panthers should be monk-specific.

Either that or have the panthers reset more often... I hardly ever get 
one.

Actually backstab is a low level ability..and i don't know what you guys are whinging about because thats our ONLY combat ability

This new chat thing is nice and all. Can one of y'all code it so we can
chat while meditating? Somethin' to do to pass the time.

Thanks,
Relgar.

it would be nice if the guild went back to the old settings
monks were the most powerfull players back then
but the ad&d terms are even more appealing..
]you could become a nec, healer etc... that would be fun

we all know the bees, gnats and wasps in the newbie zones ....
and we all like to kill them at once ...
but we are stronger than 56 or 81 gnats ...
so what about a new room in our guild where we can test our skills and our power
like breaking boards and stuff ...
it would be a nice improvement .. so please build a new guild room

There are collections of tougher monsters out there for you to test your
skills on if you so wish.

i know that i'm able to kill all the monsters out there ...
nevertheless ... what about a challenge room where Lgd lvl players
can test their powers on stone or wood blocks
and probably with a contest ...
