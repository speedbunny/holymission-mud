I said "You all smell like butt" the other day to a group of people.  It
sounded fine to me.  Are you sure you're saying it right?
[tatsuo         ] [Feb 12] [no more butts                                ]


Can we please get off this butt issue and focus on the far more important fact
that i am a tyrannical hearless bastard bent on controlling holy mission
and bringing all of its wizards into subjegation.  I mean several people
have devoted alot of time to this issue and its only fair that we expand upon
it.

Thanks,
Tats
[sargon         ] [Feb 12] [re wilbie you...                             ]

I think you can say "You smell like 'a' butt"

And oh yea Tats, sorry.  When are we going to get some assurances
that we won't fall under Tatsuo's imposed subjegation?  I mean, its 
practially driven us insane...isn't it obvious?

[wilbie         ] [Feb 12] [Tatsuo                                       ]

You're a hearless bastard?  It that some new politically correct way of
saying "deaf"?  What the hell are you talking about?  
[nae            ] [Feb 13] [Re: no more butts                            ]

You cant bring me into subjugation.

Besides, it's be pointless. I don't do anything except
annoy people, anyway!

Okay, more proof that i am a complete bastard.
My friend Barry and I were kicked out of a movie theater last year
for laughing hysterically and cheering when Leonardo Decaprio died in
Titanic

well, that's no biggie. you just echoed half
the theatre's secret desires, if truth be known!
[wilbie         ] [Feb 14] [?                                            ]

You laughed at that too?  Does that make me a bastard?

Are you saying Titanic was NOT a comedy with just a really cute chick?
[turbo          ] [Feb 15] [nope                                         ]

I think it was a tragedy.
After all, if Leo overacted any more, he'd have 
won a spot on Star Trek as the next Kirk.
[sargon         ] [Feb 15] [Re: nope                                     ]

If i knew who Leo was i'd have an opinion.
Didn't the titanic sink like a long time ago?
Has Tatsuo been time traveling on Yak's again?
I need to get me a yak.

what is your ICQ number and I can send over a few that Wilbie sent me
[wilbie         ] [Feb 15] [more                                         ]

There are more where that came from!

        
[sargon         ] [Feb 16] [re tatsuo                                    ]

You want to send time traveling light speed
Yaks to me over ICQ and i'm to post the number here.
Have you lost it?  Everyone knows that you don't post
your address on boards.
Geesh, what were you thinking?
[wilbie         ] [Feb 16] [Re: re tatsuo                                ]

Well, we could just look up your IP here on Holy Mission, and then use
the hacked patches for ICQ to find your number by the IP (if you indeed
have an ICQ account).

Lets have it out.  I want to know once and for all.
If I am not wanted here, I want to know.
So I am asking people to vote.  No one need give a reason.
I am beyond wanting to know reasons for things.
Now I simply want to know.

If I am not wanted, then I will copy my code to my hard drive and
leave the existing files to whomever wants them, or to be deleted.

I just want to know.

Don't ask for something unless you already know the answer.

What exactly is all of this shit about?  Turbo has the ability, and more
importantly the desire - to code here.  Aside from that, he's also
pretty cool.               
[bobo           ] [Mar  4] [flame                                        ]

yes this is a genuine flame, I was going to post it on the wiz board
but then thought that I should post it here.  so here it goes:

Mangla:  Fuck you.  That was just wrong.  Totally wrong on many different
levels.  Here they are:

1.  first it wrong to tell everyone to shut the hell up, you opinion
    doesn't count.  Whether this was your intent or not this is what 
    it came off as.  communication is a reciever phenomenon so 
    regardless of what your intent was it was interpreted as your 
    opinion counts for shit.

2.  Who is we?  I have seen Airborne on briefly now and again but
    not on long enough to do anything as far as the mud goes, as far
    as I can tell.  I understand that if anyone who is of higher 
    level is on I can't see them and it doesn't appear on the finger 
    info but part of the obligation of an arch is to be seen.  

3.  I don't know everything that is going on, nor do I pretend to 
    however I do know quite a bit about what is going on because of 
    the amount of tiem I have dedicated to the mud recently.  The
    notion that because someone posts what they are doing is searching
    for praise I find hard to believe.  I personally posted because
    I wanted to spur others to action as well as cooperate with others
    to produce a better area.  Not so I could say hey give me praise I
    need it.

4.  I dispute that you have been on every day to answer questions.  If
    you have been on everyday you have bee invis and unable to have 
    questions asked.

5.  RL schedule.  BAH.  If you want to talk about RL schedules, try to
    beat mine as far as hectic goes, 19 credits, on the university 
    swim team(practice up to 20 hours a week per NCAA regs) not one
    but two jobs, and anything else that comes up.  It just so happens
    that I am also dedicated to the mud right now.  Not that you aren't
    but dont' give me the hectic RL BS.

6.  Input is needed but sometimes it goes overboard.   Sounds remarkably
    similar to when I want your opinion I'll give it to you.

That's all

Bobo

Points noted. Do not agree on many parts.

And since you seem confused how "we" could be more than "me" I will
point to this same conveyance we are using right now. Boards.
There is also muc mail.
