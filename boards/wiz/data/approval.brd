[redsexy        ] [Jan 22] [Putting this board to another use.           ]

This is meant to be where mentors report to arches that their mentees areas are
ready, I know, but I think we could put it to another use.... where people with part
finished areas who are looking for feedback/bug reports/ideas can canvass those wizzes
who sit around declaring they are bored all day to take a look at their area.

I'm willing to go around anyone's area and look for typos, make comments.... not thoroughly,
but it may still help you out.

On the other hand, my area is at the inbetween stage, where its not ready for quality control, but
where I have done as much as I can until I receive feedback and comments.  So if anyone is stuck
for a minute or two, take a stroll around /players/redsexy/areas (all as complete as they will get 
except for the palace which is being modified.)

There's some games for you to play in the cantina ;-)

Hope no one minds me using the board for this, but seeing as it wasn't being used for its true
purpose I thought this was an appropriate alternative....

[uglymouth      ] [Jan 22] [Re: Putting this board to another use.       ]

As far as I'm concerned I like Redsexy's idea. Both mentor boards
have fallen in disuse for a long time now, and I think most approvals
are being requested by mail anyway, I think. Stimulating communication
between wizards might be a good thing.
However, if we're going to restyle the use of this room, I would like to
propose an even bigger change than just the board: I would like to make
this a kind of 'registration' room, where everyone who is seriously working
on an area (be it a new one, or recoding an old area) logs here what kind
of area he is making (title, theme, difficulty, starting room, proposed
location in the mud, supervisor (if any)). Ideas and comments could be
exchanged on the board. Also, it allows a better monitoring of progress,
prevents people working on similar areas, and so on. Also, if we could add a
list here of all existing areas in the mud (over time), we might get a very
interesting picture of Holy Mission's shape and development.
Just my two cents worth of thought...

A splendid idea.

Simply super.

Right now I'm working on a fishing village.  Low level, some shops
and a pub.  I was thinking maybe it could have an inn that players
could start in, if that idea that someone had about different start
locations ever goes through.  The area is about 50% complete, but
it will be a while before I get all finished - rl time conflicts.
 The monsters and items are almost complete, it's the rooms that need
coded, but I have a map drawn so that goes fast.

/players/wilbie/fishing/ if you want to look around.

I'm also planning to code an area based on the labyrinth legend.
Basically a big maze with lots of traps and a REALLY BIG minotour
in the center.  Was hoping to even make it a quest.  

This "registration" board is a good idea.  It gives us all an idea of
whats being done.
[exos           ] [Jan 23] [current area projects                        ]

Ok I'll be second....

I am working on a new area with really REALLY nasty random quests.
This will take place in the "City of Brass" which will be hidden underground.
A lot of Arabian Nights stuff just might appear in this area.
The quest itself is gonna be nasty like Haunter was when I was a player.

I am also working on finishing up the recodes of Padrone's and Tegerl's areas.
More on this later.  I've been very VERY busy the last month or two off the mud.

My area(s):
The first area is a castle, town, and surrounding forest.  It is about
100 rooms and contains a quest.  It also has part of a second quest that
will be implemented with the second area.  It has a full town with shops,
a really cool armourer who will make any armour or item for you (ok
on 20 or so right now) 

The second area is a 120 room downward spiral filled with orcs, trolls, goblins,
ogres, and a real badass monster.

Ok, I've been drafted to recode all of Tamina's dir.  I'm about
halfway done with the quest perilous, then it's on to King Arthur's
Castle.  She had started a quest with that dir, and I'm going to try
to see if I can gather all the pieces of it together and get it
working.

My area: /players/brainsprain/bis/ subdirs room/ npc/ items/ is ready
to be quality checked.  Before my mentor gets to it, i ask that
everyone makes his job a little easier by going through it and
noting any problems they might note.  The starting room is 
/players/brainsprain/bis/room/beach

Thanks ahead of time.

Thanks Ugly :-)

For existing areas on the MUD I think a log of sorts would be handy... I've put a list
in /players/redsexy/docs outlining existing areas I am aware of as they come to me, but I've never
been much of an explorer, and therefore the list is somewhat incomplete!!

As for my area, there is a README doc also in /players/redsexy/docs outlining the story and quest
ideas behind it, which I'll summarise here.

The area is jedi with technology and guns written out.  Based in the desert lands of Mos Eisley,
there is a canitna area, a town area and an island.  The desert itself is a 72 room maze.

I am now working on Jabba's Palace, but need to spell check the place thoroughly and add a few more
items before completion.

Start rooms:

/players/redsexy/jedi/areas/cantina/3 ---------- cantina
/players/redsexy/jedi/areas/desert/5 ---------- desert
/players/redsexy/jedi/areas/moseisley/1 ---------- town
/players/redsexy/jedi/areas/island/5 ---------- island
/players/redsexy/jedi/areas/palace/15 ---------- palace (under construction)

Load the raft in /players/redsexy/jedi/objects to venture between the island and mainland!

Have fun,

Redsexy
[redsexy        ] [Feb  3] [And about my quest                           ]

Thought I'd liven you (well, ok bore you to death) with a note about my quest.

                >>>>>>>>>>>>The Master of the Dimension<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Sephillious, the master of the dimensions, is getting old.  He needs someone to take over
his position and to run the seven domains, but his replacement needs to be worthy of the title.
As such he has issued a challenge to adventurers near and far to prove themselves as the new
Master of the Dimensions.

                -------------------------------------------------------

I'm trying to make this the ultimate no cheat quest.  So far the adventurer has to explore the seven
domains and gather information about them from the demons who train there.  Then the keeper of the 
domain tests them on the knowledge they have gathered.  There are 15 questions in each domain list,
and the keeper asks a random two questions to any adventurer.  Because of the way its structured,
its very easy to change the questions on a regular basis.  Once the adventurer has passed the 7
domain tests, he can go to Sephillious for the final test.  If he passes this correctly, he will 
be tranferred into a series of rooms, each with a small puzzle to solve.

That's where the idea gets hazy!  Anyway, have fun y'all.  Anyone wanting to check it out so far:

I guess I'm the only one who uses this board...

I'm working on an addition to my Cathedral area.  Bigger, badder, and
more aggressive.  Something for the upper legend levels to play with.
Don't worry - nothing that's TOO big :)                     

Anyway, am hoping to have it complete in a few weeks.

It is desgined for legends around L 8.  It has a lot of monsters in it.

Hi all

Seeing as Kryll and I always seem to miss each other, Tats has offered
to take up the QC job on my area...

The paths you will need are:
/players/redsexy/jedi/areas/cantina  start room 3.c
this directory already checked thoroughly by Kryll but you may like to doublecheck

/players/redsexy/jedi/areas/desert   start room d5.c
again, checked by Kryll.

/players/redsexy/jedi/areas/palace   start room 15.c
most of this directory checked by Kryll, just rooms in the high 20s and 30s left.

/players/redsexy/jedi/areas/moseisley/   start room 1.c
Needs full QC

/players/redsexy/jedi/areas/island   start room 5.c
Needs full QC (probably a long job, this was my first coding effort, a couple of years old now!)

/players/redsexy/dimensions/connect   start room chamber.c
The whole dimensions directory needs QCing, also a quest in there.

Have fun, anyone wanting to go for a wander feel free to do so,

Redsexy has two areas ready for installation.
Both of them listed in previous note.

These areas are VERY good, i was impressed.
The qc turned up only 8 typos, and one bad object.
Those are repaired

There is a quest that is fully functional, and the solution is in the quest dir
for arch conveinince.

I recommend immeadiate installation and promotion of this talented wizard.

Bobo also has an area ready to go, if you forgot

Raindell has foolishly allowed me to be his mentor.  He is already well versed
in the art of random transings and killing players, giving away experience and making
people's lives hell, so I suggest we set the test date for next weekend.

He has yet to learn how to abuse experience bugs or code illegal tools, but I
guess that will come with time.

He has also expressed an interest in being Wilbie's assisstant for all affairs
concerned with the Monk guild.

Whichever Arch responds the quickest gets to put him through hours of hell. Please
bare in mind he will be fragile as he will have had to put in many gruelling hours
under my command.

I am writing this as if Raindell WILL be a he.  For the course of this week the Appr
teasing committee hasn't decided on Gender.
