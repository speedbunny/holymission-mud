I personally vote to see turbo in handcuffs and tied
to the bed and .....................well ok so there is no board
for this comment.  So dust spank him a few times!

After that whole thing about Turbo handcuffed to a bed, I'm going to
retract my idea.  Let's forget the beating.  Yuck.

Tatsuo, what wouldnt you do?  Your last note said 'We wouldn"t it anyway'.
I'm confused.  granted, its not hard to do, but I'm confused.
Or is this a hate thing?
That would make sense, since I never could understand those...
[thumper        ] [Jan 28] [confused                                     ]

I can't believe I am saying this
but I agree with turbo.

I'm now working at a CyberExchange so I'll be bringing in
a lot of new characters with the same/similar IP to me.
Just so everyone knows I'm not multi-ing.

No, you fool.  This is the Sheriff's Board...  We need to accuse one
another more.  I think Exos is dealing drugs out of the Mage guild.
I also think Tatsuo is using the Ninja to cover a slave trading operation.
I'm pretty sure Mangla is the ringleader in a conspiracy to get kids to
start smoking.  
[turbo          ] [Feb 20] [Accuse                                       ]

Perhaps Tatsuo's new kitty is just a way to 
get Paprika to come out of hiding so he can kidnap her
and ransom her for his real victum: Saffron
We can't let this happen.  First, he'll get Paprika, then Saffron
Next thing you know, he'll want Ginger, Baby, Posh and Sporty!

[redsexy        ] [Mar 14] [Treat                                        ]

Treat completed my quest today.  Unfortunately the quest object name was
different to the name  gave it originally so it didn't set his quest.

His completion of the quest was logged, and I'd snooped him all the way
so I know he did everything right -- as such I transed him back to the
final room after making the necessary file adjustment and got him to pull
the lever again.

His quest is now set.

Hope this doesn't contravene any of the rules (except maybe the "being kind
to Demolian leads to a bad reputation" rule).

You were NICE to demolian?  You're in for it now Redsexy.  
Next thing you know, people are gonna start calling you 'a good kid'.  
Or worse, 'helpful' !  I do not envy you, the names you will be called.

I think you did the right thing red.
But does your quest need a little looking at?
But you prolly already did.

Damn it Red...  You deliberately bypassed the hinder_treat() function
and the "don't be nice" rule.  Remind me to spank you.

Well, I just read those rules and it says that no wizard will be
removed for periods of inactivity after reaching Wiz status...

Just thought I'd get that off my chest.

Think she has more than two chars. If this is still illegal
please post to here and i'll talk to her.  I don't think its
a big deal right now  but someday we may have tons
