[redsexy        ] [Mar 30] [Need a little time....                       ]

There is one reason and only one reason I never got involved with the
wiz strike.  I have Summoner Guild now.  Summoner is the only thing I
ever wanted on this MUD, and I have wanted it since 1993.  In a way
I can understand Nylakoorub's reasoning over Vag.  I truly feel as if
I am the only one who remembers the whole mystery and legend surrounding
Summoner.  For anyone else to have the guild at this very moment in time
would make no sense whatsoever.  It may have looked as if no alterations were
made to the original, but even I forget quite how much has been done.
It had been lying in my directory for a year and a half - I'd been playing
with it forever.

I am also sick and tired of everything that goes on here.  The arch situation
is a MASSIVE problem.  There's the obvious situation of having people up
there who just do not care about the place.  Then there's the more subtle problem.
The problem that everyone up there thinks and acts in the same way. If I
made up some problem as a hypothetical, I know exactly how each Arch would
react.  And at the end of the day, no matter how much you all may hate me saying
this, in any heated situation it will be Mangla's decision that rides it.
Sauron and Mangla are both VERY good friends of mine here, I think the
world of them.  But there needs to be a balancing influence in the decision
making process.  Airborne, you know I also think very highly of you.
But isn't it time you considered retirement?  I would like to hear how you
jusitfy having held on to your position for so long without actively
being seen to do anything.  Maybe I should have talked this over with you
in private first, but these aren't just mine and Wilbie's rumblings.
At the same time, if you do go there will be nobody at all to give a
different perspective on matters.  Which leads to a catch 22 situation.

No one respond to this yet, I'm nowhere NEAR finished.  Will continue
in a second...
[redsexy        ] [Mar 30] [Re: Need a little time....                   ]

So as much as I think Airborne should retire, I also see the need for someone on
as an arch who will challenge Mangla and make him think from time to time.
Ideal person for that?  Maybe not Tatsuo, but Wilbie would have been
a good choice.  But all we got was a straight out loud voiced "No New
Arches".  I was told I would hear some reasons as to why there were
to be no new arches.  I never did.

The latest turn of events is just fantastic.  So Exos has decided to take
some leave?  We have eight females complaining about him - oh with me that
makes 9.  But because of a lack of evidence against him he walks off
with nothing more than a telling off.  There are three people who don't
play here anymore because of Exos.  I talked to him yesterday, again,
I got to make my feelings known to him.  Being harrassed, spied upon and
made to feel like shit is not something nine people are just going to
make up off the top of their heads.  Excuse me for posting this so
publically but screw your need for evidence.  I know he did it to me,
what the hell puts me in any position to disbelieve anyone elses
story?  What Exos has done is far worse than what Tatsuo did.
Tatsuo "victimised" three people, Exos - nine who have spoken out
about it.

So now I have everything I ever wanted here.  I just don't have the
friendly, lively MUD I wanted it on.   I could go and get new players,
but why the hell would I want to bring them here as it is at the moment?

Where is this all leading to, or is it just a let off of steam?

First, Airborne, I would like you to defend your reasons for still being
an arch here.  I'd like you to explain to people why you make a
better arch than Wilbie would.  Hell, lets make it personal, I'd like
you to defend why you'd make a better arch than me! (laugh all you like,
gotta remember I've done it before on a much bigger place than this).

Sorry if it seems I'm singling you out in particular, but its a gripe I've
heard a lot lately.  It had me asking the same question.  I'm anticipating
your answer to be along the lines I suggested earlier.

Second, without anyone taking the strike action, we've lost a lot of
people through this situation.  It started off as a few, but look at it now.
Bobo and Wilbie, both of them prime candidates for a promotion, both of them
out of here for the forseeable future because they are not happy with 
what is happening here.  Tatsuo, banished.  Exos, voluntary leave of absence
and Turbo, following Exos (an assumption from what he said yesterday).
And now there's people like myself, Akira, Beardy, Nylakoorub -
sorry for mentioning you guys without permission, but I think I'm right in
saying this.  We are ALL sick of what is happening here.   But we
stay.  I stay because I have made commitments here, and because I don't
want to lose Summoner.  But that is the only reason I stay instead of
making my point by leaving.

I said two weeks, and I have always been negotiable on that.  Also, yes, its
a game, it should be fun and if we're not having fun we should leave?
How many people can honestly say that anything that has gone on here over
the past few weeks has been all that fun?  Sure we've have our good times,
but its been wrought with people wanting "talks", blind communications with
no one really listening to anyone elses points of view.

I haven't even had time to go fool around with Brainsprain since I came back.

Enough of this, though I still feel no better.

I have to back red up on her request to airborne

[mangla         ] [Mar 30] [Re: Need a little time....                   ]

Ok, Point by point.

There have been several times I have bene on the losing end of
discussions. Just becuase we do not make OUR political squabbles
known to you does not mena they are non-existant. One of the
requirements we have withe each other is that we try and put
on a unified front and once a decision is made, stick to it.
Do not take unity for single dictator.

As far as Airborne retiring, he has talked about it, but never
decided on it. We Are not gonna force him to do anything. That
is part of our unity. Yes I screwed up on that before, but I
learn from my mistakes, unlike some other people that are no
longer welcomed here by the ARCHes as a team.

As for Exos, I have explained. The statemetns I got CONTRADICTS
the evidence I have. If you can explain that one away, then I
would be glad to hear it. If everything is in agreement, action
would be taken. As I am sure you are aware. When it is prudent,
the ARCHes do act for the mud.

Tatsuo victimised most everyone he talked to. Just listen at
the crap he stirred up with a 2/3 lies conversation. You telling
me you prefer someone that will lie to you at the drop of a
hat to get his way over the current truthful scenario?

Alot of people have chosen to take a step back. From what I
understand it is not in strike, but in perspective. They wish
to evaluate where HM fits into thier, get this one, REAL LIFE.

As for being fun. No it has not. Fighting a smear campaign
with truth is about as tiring as you can get, because a lie
always sounds better.

Now you fooling around with brainsprain, I will not comment. ;)

-Mangla
[brainsprain    ] [Mar 30] [Uh oh, my $.02                               ]

	Ok, i have been reading both sides of this argument
and I believe that I am finally capable of commenting on it
intelligently...

1) We the coders are frustrated.  I left for over 6 months because
having written a large are and a quest and having placed a log to
note the number of people entering it, i found the same 5-6 names
over and over again.  I saw 1-3 players on at the busiest time,
with 4-5 wizzes sitting idle.  I saw a promised lib that never
materialized, i saw a guild system crippled, waiting for permission
to be fixed.  I saw good coders go my route and walk away.  

2) You the arches are committed to this mud, at the very least Mangla
Sauron and Airborne.  When i have something that needs to be addressed,
you help me.  If it is code, i go to the first two, but Airborne
makes a great balance, he has been here since the beginning of time,
his opinions hold the weight of tradition and things done before, 
and therefore I think his opinion must be weighed as quality assurance.

I see this clambering for new arch positions as a power feignt. (sp)
The complaint I am hearing is "no one codes anymore"  I have been
hearing this for over a year.  Tatsuo did come back, and he did
liven up the mud, but it is a good thing he was banished.  In example
I talked to him about the thieves guild, testing it against the
ninja's guild to see how they balanced out.  He dested shadows in
the thieves guild just so that he could say that his skills (ninja)
were better than the thieves.  That doesnt help balance.

So here is my call to arms, to all of you: Wilbie, Mangla, Sauron, Airborne,
Redsexy, Sargon, Exos, Bobo, Turbo, and all of the other wizzes I have
seen talking about this.... Code.  Just like shadowmonk said, if you 
can think of it and it sounds fun, code it.  If you are frustrated 
with the progress of the mud, offer to help, i myself am recoding
goldsun's dir.  If you are going to just scream "NOTHING CHANGES"
you dont deserve a damn promotion, nuff said.  It doesnt take
an arch to bring players to the game, write a quest, code an area, 
build a guild, or even teach others to code.  Any wiz should be 
able to do those.  An arch is an administrator, their main job is not
to code, although they usually handle the lib.  Their job is to 
administrate the mud, to give it direction.  I see direction:
Implement a new lib, recode old areas...  What i see missing
is players coming back.  And you know what, they will never come
back to a mud divided, or for that matter one that is not on
the mudlists.  So lets come up with a vision... let the arches direct it, implement it...
that is how this should be handled, not by pointing fingers and
placing blame.

[wilbie         ] [Mar 31] [My thoughts                                  ]

I didn't intend this to turn into a personal war.  However, in these
situations, some personal conflics are unavoidable.  I regret the fact
that all of this has come between me and the others involved.

I also did not intend to stop or hurt the mud - I want that to be very
clear to everyone.  What I have said in the past few weeks was, in my
opinion, for the good of Holy Mission.

The coding strike idea was a calculated risk.  The intention was to 
show the gravity of the problems facing this mud.  Face it, a lot of us
have been trying to get this stuff settled for years - yes, years - with
no results.  I thought that a visible, unified demonstration of our 
frustration with the current situation would drive the point home.  I
intended the strike - had it occured - to be rather short.  

In my opinion, we need change if this mud is to survive.  We need arches
who are active...  Active as in actually doing something.

You know, despite the fact that the strike never came to pass, I don't 
feel that it was a complete failure.  At the very least, people are now
thinking about the problems at hand.  

People are speaking up, instead of letting things slide by.

If that is all that I've accomplished, then that will have to do.

As for my leaving...
I made the decision to leave Holy Mission back in November.  Tatsuo talked
me out of it.  He wanted to come back, and he wanted me to help him
resurrect the place.  Honestly, I saw bringing Holy Mission back as a
great challange.  It was something that I had always wanted to be a part
of, and it seemed like it might work out.

The demands that I listed in my strike message are flexible.  None of 
them are carved in stone.  What I suggest to all of you is simple:  Think
about what YOU want for this mud.  Get together as a group and think 
about what YOU ALL want for this mud.  That's how this place will survive.
Having four guys who make all the decisions behind the scenes won't
get it done.  

If things improve here, I will come back - if I'm still wanted.
[airborne       ] [Mar 31] [My retirement                                ]

I was to begin by saying that I don't think I have ever made the 
claim that I was not ready to retire.  I think it has been fairly
common knowledge that it is coming.  I have spoken to the other arches
many times about when the time will be right and allow me to touch
upon the two main reasons I have not.

First, in the last year there has only been one arch wizard who has
not been called into real life and not been able to be here on a near 
daily basis, myself.  Mangla, Sauron, Haplo, Kryll, they have all
had periods of time in which they were unexpectedly gone from the mud 
for very legitimate reasons.  For whatever reason I have been able to 
login and answer emergencies on a near daily basis.  With only
Mangla around in the last few months, there needs to be someone 
who at least shows a presense and can be reached if there is an
emergency.

Second, as you already touched upon Red, there is a very
strong Mangla influence in the desicions that are made.  I have 
served as a counter balance for these desicions and I think 
Mangla has benefitted greatly from it. I don't threaten people 
with do things my way or I leave, I make rational arguements for
what I feel is right or wrong. I dn't think there is anyone who
has come to me with a rational discussion who did not get one 
in turn. I am able to keep my head on straight even in light on
extremely unpleasant discourse at times and I do it without 
complaints.

Remeber, I come here because I like it here.  There is not one
person on this mud who logs in daily and has done so for as long
as I have.  I had hoped that Wilbie would be able to take my position
as Arch this summer, after things with Tatsuo had a chance to pan out.
But it has become clear to myself and the rest of the arches I have 
spoken to that there is a distinct lack of dedication and maturity
surfacing recently.

Let me ask you Red, and the other that have judged me for the 
edesicion to remain Arch this long... when was the last time you
welcomed someone back who threatened your physical well being
simply because you thought it was the best thing for this mud?
I may not be perfect, I never claim to be, but I have been here 
longer than anyone here and still find the love to return every day.

I am ready to retire.  These bones of mine are not what they used to 
be. But I won't place the future of this mud at stake because it 
would be easier to forget about it.

Anyone who has anything further to say is more than welcome to 
bring it to my attention.

Airborne
[wilbie         ] [Mar 31] [Airborne                                     ]

I am sorry the you see my recent actions as immature and as a lack of 
dedication to this mud.  I see them as just the opposite.  The decision
to stop coding was not an easy one by any means, but I made it because
I thought that it would make a point.  I thought that by making a stand
I could make some change occur.  Judging from the response (or lack of
response) from my fellow wizards, it would seem that I was wrong in
thinking that I could change anything.  But I would rather try and fail
than simply go on with the same lack of progress.

I am also sorry to see you going, despite the fact that I am one of the
people who suggested it.  You've been a great Arch in my opinion, but
I just feel that an arch has to be much more active to be
effective.  Please understand that it was not a personal thing...  Indeed, it
was a difficult decision to even suggest it - and I'm sure it was 
difficult for Redsexy to suggest it as well.

Those of you who know me know that I do not make rash decisions.  I don't
make choices on a whim, and I try my best not to let personal opinions
influence me.  

As for someone taking your place, I would personally recommend Redsexy.
She is the most reasonable and level-headed wizard here, and she has 
the coding skills.

People have taken what I have been saying as "Do this or I leave", but
that really wasn't the intention.  It's also not a campaign against you,
Mangla, and the other arches.  I'm simply saying that the current system
doesn't work - it hasn't worked for three years.  Having four or five
people making all the decisions behind closed doors works just fine for
a big mud that is running fine, but it CAN NOT WORK for a mud that is
being rebuilt.  And it most certainly CAN NOT WORK if some of those 
decision makers are not taking an active interest.  I'm not just saying
that we need new arches, I'm saying we need a new definition for the
arch position.  The arches should be the muds best, most active coders.
It should not be a group who meets once in a while to argue about things.

At my new RL job, I've had a lot of time to think about all that has gone on here lately.
My first instinct as to retire, but then I decided leaving wouldn't solve anything.
A friend of mine, Saffron, said
"Holy Mission is a mud on life support"
I don't want this place to die.  There's still a few players worth coding for.
I don't have to like everyone to code for the few good players that remain.


That, and if I left, demolian would be WAY too happy.

Rather than throw shit back and forth on the boards, I suggest that we
find a time (or a few times) to meet and discuss the future of the mud.
I'd REALLY like to come back as an active coder...  I would just like 
to feel comfortable that our situation will improve before I decide what
I want to do. 

I would further suggest that we meet as friends and as people striving
for a common goal.  Just for the sake of objective discussion, let's
leave rank out of it and meet on common ground.  Also, let's try to leave
personal issues out as much as possible.

The best time for me is on weekday evenings (between 6:00pm and 8:00pm)
or late at night (after midnite) in Cleveland time.  I'm open to other
times if necessary.

seem to be personally involved in any of the issues, and he is also

I can be here between about 5.30PM and 10.00PM PST (1.30AM to 6.00AM GMT)

I don't see the connection between breathing and teleporting.
I would think that if you can't breath that would be the
ideal time for needing teleport.  Unless of course the idea
of not being able to breath was part of the feel of the area
in which case the coder should have put no_teleport in teh
properites of the room.

I didn't know thieves could teleport :)

Seriously though, an area that keeps you from breathing was created that
way for a reason - to make the area difficult in some way.  For example,
the underwater part of the Ryu quest was made that way because it is
a major challange to have to fight a bunch of demons while having to
go up for air.  When you allow people to teleport from such an area, you
completely ruin the challange.

In my opinion, certain areas SHOULD be no_teleport.  Furthermore, I think
that teleporting in general should bear a price of some sort.  
Teleport should be a last resort way to get out of a situation that you don't
want to deal with anymore...  It should not be a way to make your 
adventure any easier.

nothing to do with my RL-work, but adresses MUD-problems instead,
I'll forward them to the administrators here.

especially those player named "Mark" IRL:

) I cannot believe you just took all that effort and risk I 
) put into writing my letter and passed it on to the very 
) person I am complaining about.  

should be aware that I don't read 345 lines of email concerning
HM-politics. *if* you are complaining about Mangla, then you'd
better do that in the first three, four lines ... else I miss
everything of it.

To make a simple statement: I am not interested in politics.
Than you,

Have you noticed how everyone goes REALLY quiet on the boards after
Herp posts?

Well what I'm going to say is this:

1) For some reason there is still a bad atmosphere here at the moment.
2) I've been grumpy for days about this place and don't know why.
3) Something inspirational needs to be done here, but dont ask me what.

Vague?  Hell, yeah, vagueness is my strong point.

I'll get back to you when I've thought about this more thoroughly.

Anla'shok Turbo sings a song of the bravery of HM.

Its a bard spell ... inspiration.

Just wanted to post a 'hey' note, seems like not as many people logging
in lately, and the boards are dead.  What's going on?  I want to read
a zillion posts a day, well at least 4 or 5.  Get to it.

Speaking as a wizard I'm really f**king looking

Just for the record I vote Steerpike for Arch
Or Mangla for Arch.
Anyone but Nyalakoorub

Have you ever noticed that the more things change the
more they remain the same?
In case anyone hasn't noticed, the recent promotions to arch
aren't logged.  Why is that?  Did Herp do it so its not
logged?
If not Herp, then who?  Why?
Looking for answers to these and more probing questions.
