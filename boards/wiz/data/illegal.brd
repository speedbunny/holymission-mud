The Troll King is giving out unlimited exp to players that are high 
enough level to spare with him.

I agree with Saffrin. By 'trying' to kill the Troll King
I got a lot of xp each time...
Lucky me, but I agree that's not fair...

Only high level players with VERY good protection can
leave their character in the king's hut to do as many
kills as they want, others will wimpy out and have to 
heal before they go back, which  makes it almost like
any other place and the troll  king is not worth that
much xp. There have been and probably are places here
that are more 'dangerous' in this respect. Can't seem
to think of any in particular right now though...

I remember a player (from Bar Harbor) who would go to one room where
there was a autoattacker monster who he could take without healing.
He would put his char in the room and leave it there all day while
he worked adn rack up the xp throughout the day.  Is the troll king 
similar to that?

Yes it is (at least for a good fighter) similar to
Sargon's example.
And the Troll isn't that strong... so many players
can take advantage of the problem...

When the monster dies, move the player to another room with the same
desc, same exits, but no monster that gets cloned.   The person 
would then have to leave and come back in.
