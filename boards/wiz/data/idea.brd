CAn we have a set_wander to limit a monster to s specific area
instead of having to make it complex.

Like adding one line to that monster:
set_wander("/players/saffrin/area/");

Just a thought

I was on a mud once where if you killed a player guards were cloned
in the village that would hunt the playerkiller until either the
playerkiller died (doesn't have to be killed by the guard) or the
player killed the guard or reboot.  There are lots of ways to do this
and i think its kinda cool.  I don't think i could code this
but i know at least one wiz has said they could and would like to 
code it.  What do you think?

If done right this might work. Got my mind racing.
Will have a talk about among the arches as to validity,
then if feasible maybe pass to someone to do, otherwise
maybe more ideas can come of it.

what ever happened to this idea? also what about instead of guards
roaming the village instead have a body guard.  applicable to 
when players attack only.
[redsexy        ] [Oct 31] [Arena idea.                                  ]

At the moment, although wizzes can enter the arena, they do not
die when killed (for obvious reasons!!) but they also do not get thrown
out of the arena.

Help arena also says a player testcharacter can enter, but apparently not.

It would make more sense if the test character can enter without the abbility to heal.#


Then again, I've yet to win an arena as Redsexy - so it shows how good I am :(

[sargon         ] [Nov  3] [multi wielding and shields                   ]

I was looking into coding a two_handed lightsaber for the Jedi
and one of the implications is that the jedi cannot
wield the two_handed weapon and wear a shield.  
But it dawned on me that everyone who multi wields shouldn't 
be able to wear a shield either.  I checked and all guilds
can do that.  It doesn't make sense to me.  I don't know
how to go about fixing it, maybe in the player....

[darastor       ] [Nov  8] [Re: multi wielding and shields               ]

I agree with Sargon - if you use your off hand to wield a weapon there is no
way you should be able to use a shield effectively. Maybe wield should check
to see if you're wearing a shield and if so no second weapon (and 
wear for a shield should do teh same in reverse)

[redsexy        ] [Nov 19] [Re: multi wielding and shields               ]

Hmm, I have to disagree with that.  I could wear a suit of armour and hold
a two handed weapon at the same time.  Maybe different classes of armours
should be acceptable/non acceptable

Red

[darastor       ] [Nov 19] [Re: multi wielding and shields               ]

I wasn't talking about all armour - just shields. There must be a 
difference since you can already wear armour and a shield, but not two
suits of armour. I'm proposing a check for shields, not for all armour.

D
[wilbie         ] [Nov 20] [possible solution                            ]

A "hold" command for shields, instead of "wear".  It would check
the number of available arms (2 I should hope) the same way that
"wield" does.
[redsexy        ] [Nov 29] [Room idea                                    ]

As well as a smell property, is there a listen property?

I know it can be included in each individual room using an add_action,
but I think that listen should really be inherited?  Any comments?

(That is unless it is already in the room code and I overlooked it :) )

Red
[bobo           ] [Nov 29] [Re: Room idea                                ]

since loud sounds or overwhelming smells are imediately noticed shouldn't
they be included in the room desc, if they are subtle then maybe you have
to concentrate to notice them but otherwise i think that it should go in
the desc...since there aren't a lot of sounds that are so subtle that you
have to listen for them just to hear them then i don't think that an add
action is a bad thing...but your right if it were in the lib code for the
few rooms that it is pertinent for it would be easier. 
[exos           ] [Nov 30] [RE: Room Idea                                ]

It is a good idea that is used on other MUDs.
Obvious sounds should be in the long_desc, or as a heart_beat 
function.  But if players listen they MAY hear a more subtle sound.

My solution?  If you want to use it, code it yourself for now.
Leave a note at the beginning of your room to clue the players to
"listen" every now and again.  
[sauron         ] [Nov 30] [Re: RE: Room Idea                            ]

Please ask an arch _before_ contemplating adding a heart_beat to your
room code... In general, this is not a good idea, and not the best
solution for the problem.
[wilbie         ] [Dec  6] [boards                                       ]

Is there a way to code boards so that, when a person is writing a
message they recieve NO outside interference?  Meaning - no tells,
no chat lines, no "so-and-so left the room", no talking, no nothing.
This would REALLY be useful.

The same thing would kinda rule for the editor too :)

[mangla         ] [Dec  6] [Re: boards                                   ]

Then you have ot think of the opposite side of the coin.
If I am in the editor or writing a note, and I will be
there for a while, you would get aggravated if you could not
talk to me when you wanted to. I like ot be availible
even if I am editing.

[bobo           ] [Oct 16] [his 2 centavos                               ]

Well I think that it's a good idea, the problem with that is that 
different mobs, have different abiliies in different areas.  For example
a troll may have 2 different strengths depending which area he's in.  It
would provide for a little more streamlining of the mud but hey isn't 
saying all trolls are the same stereotyping :)
[darastor       ] [Oct 16] [Re: his 2 centavos                           ]

Ah but there's no need to reuse the code if you want a different
troll...so surely it just provides a better option

Hi,

Check out /players/redsexy/docs/existing_areas
or whatever I called it.  Its an incomplete list
of areas on the MUD that people can add to as
and when.

Then again, as and when seems to equal never
around here at the moment.

Blah, I'm not getting into that one...

So how about it?  Everybody mail lists of their mobs, eq, etc. to Redsexy
and she'll make a complete list.

Her post sounded like volunteering to me :)

Back in the old days, Adventurers had three "spells".  I know one was 
fireball or something, and I can't remember what the others were.  They
all sucked, so you didn't miss much.

[airborne       ] [Feb 21] [Re: spells                                   ]

That was 'missle' not 'missile'.  The early days of mudding.

Hell, I remember when fireball was something to look forward to!
[mangla         ] [Feb 22] [Re: spells                                   ]

They were removed becuase the Adv. guild was not a supported guild.
We wanted players to change from adv.

Note: I did not do this, was done early in my wiz days.

If we have interest in revamping the powers of the default
adv. guild, then I might be willing to entertain some talk.
Though do not hold breath. That is a big change...
