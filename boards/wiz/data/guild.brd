Only one guild master per guild. Someone will have to
take responsibilty to place the guild in thier directory, for now.

Redsexy has expressed her interest in opening the Summoners.

If there are problems with my list then please let me know. I
would like to get the guilds up and running with active GM's again.

I will tlk to Turbo and see if we can move bard guild to his directory.
(Thus he becomes "GM"), then I will move mage into my directory.

Well the stuff's in my dir, so I guess that makes it me.

But who knows.

Make sure I have not missed anything. Some of the
proposed GM's have become the active GM, but I will
still treat them as propsed until we are done with
the guild shuffling. Which should be very soon.

Bard Guild has been transferred to Turbo's directory.
Turbo and I will share the guild, but he is "offical GM" now.

Once this transfer is over and mage guild is completed,
Mage Guild will be moved to my directory and I will be
"official GM of Mages"

the GM-ship for the druids.

I am having trouble getting to this board.
Did this error occur because of the change over from Exos' dir to mine?
[sargon         ] [Mar 19] [Re: b bard                                   ]

Hmm, i went there with no problems and the path is 
/players/turbo/guild/rooms/bard1 when i get there.
Seems to me that it works.

It it theoretically possible that the first shot to the brain
will not kill him and he will be lingering in great pain.
Assuming he hasn't blow away substantial parts of the motor cortext
he could fire a second shot.
[wilbie         ] [Mar 19] [Re: two bullets                              ]

Or he might be planning to take someone else with him.
[darastor       ] [Mar 19] [Re: two bullets                              ]

Or he might just be a very poor shot, and worried that he might miss with
the first one

[redsexy        ] [Apr  1] [Long term plans for Summoner                 ]

Hi, I thought I would take the time to write a constructive note instead of
ripping the hell out of everyone.  As you're probably all aware I'm very fond
of the Summoner Guild and I thought I'd enlighten you as to my plans over a 100
level system.

I see the guild moving away from the traditional spells/skills base of others
onto something totally different.  I'd like feedback if people think this is
going to work or not.

Now, how many of you have played any of the Final Fantasy games?  No,
neither have I but my main idea has been drawn from there.  Materia.
The Summoner guild after the traditional levels of 1-29 will become
materia based.

"So wtf is materia?" I hear some of you ask.  For the purposes of Holy
Mission materia is fragments of the prism lost around our world when it
exploded in the Summoner Wars.  When Genocyber restored the prism, fractions
remained hidden in the lands.

Materia drains energy slowly and randomly from the holder, feeding itself.
Eventually it reaches a break point.  When that break point is reached,
the holder can choose to activate the materia's special power.  After
activation, the materia is, of course, destroyed.

This is how I envision it working.  On joining Summoner, the player has
to choose an elemt to "train with" for the first 30 levels.  They will
receive either fire, water, earth or air materia which will stay with
them and have a special attack associated with it.  This materia will
never explode.  It is a symbol of their allegiance to that elemental.It
will reach a brak point perhaps once every two or three hours playtime.

After level 30 the Summoner can start making use of the other materia
hidden around the MUD.  There will be sixteen types of materia,
each with its own creature, spell or skill.  Some of these may take
days of playtime to activate and the breakpoint will be determined by
the holder's initial elemental choise.  There is a random chance the
materia may explode unexpectedly, or just not activate, but if
successfully used, it will bring devestation.

For example:

Materia type :         Robey.
Materia Spell:    Summon Titan
Activation     20,000 SP
Modifiers -
Fire        100%
Water     100%
Earth     50%
Air     150%

hee hee, never try to format stuff in ZMUD

Titan Stats:   WC20 AC20 level 100.
Draws at:    100SP random every hour.

OK so that's THAT bit of the idea, now on to some stuff I'd like to see
added, not just for Summoner use, but which should be of benefit to every
guild.

I would like to see a property in room.c along the lines of set_surround.
I think this could make guilds a lot more interesting.  For example,
Barbarians could get a bonus for fighting in a desert, Druid in a forest,
thieves underground, etc.  Means adding one line of code to a hell of a
lot of files, but with the amount of areas being developed right now I think
its a good time to be thinking about it.

I'd also like to see a set_element type in monster.c.  The advantages of this
being that spelldamage can be varied according to the type of spell used.
For example, attacking a dragon with an ice spell would be more effective
that attacking it with a fire spell.  Most magical guilds have a fire based
spell - or some kind of elemental attack.  Fire against ice giants should
rock.

These are VERY long term plans.  But I thought I'd let you all know
about now what I'm intending on busying myself with.

Comments, suggestions and harsh criticism welcome,

Redsexy

There's a bug in ninja camouflage. If I camouflage and reveal repeatedly
the items which camouflage clones stay there, reveal doesn't get rid of them.

This presumably also happens now there's no time out on camouflage
So we have players running round cloning lots of items 
when two on any player would be enough - this is clearly a bug and one 
of you ninja dudes should do something about it.

Please note that I will test this again every week and re report
it until I see something done

Looks to me as though ninja can camouflage in combat...surely if
they're in combat they are far too busy to get camouflaged
They should at least have to leave the room containing their opponent
before they can do that.

It has come to my attention that Bard Guild is too powerful.
I have been told to change it.
I have mailed Exos, the person in charge of the guild.
Yes, I may carry the title of Gm, but thats all it is.
Do whatever you want , its not my place to stop anyone.
All I can ask is that you wait for Exos' reply to the mail I sent him,
or ask him directly. 

but as i have said before, its not my mud, you do not have to listen to me.

OK I know it's been two weeks but that bug with camouflage is still there.
Is anyone working on ninja code or should camouflage justbe taken out 
of the game until the bug is fixed?

[wilbie         ] [Apr 16] [Re: Bug in ninja camouflage                  ]

I've been looking into it, but I've been kind of strapped for time.
Tatsuo can look at it too.  It's been like that since Patience coded
it, but you're right - should be fixed.
