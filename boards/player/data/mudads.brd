[stiletto       ] [Dec  3] [Archon                                       ]

Previously known as Fury of the Dragon, this mud is now under
almost totally new management.  It features a brand new balance
system as well as a quest system that is being put into play as 
we speak.  This can be called a beta mud I guess but with a core
group of hardcore wiz coders who know there shit, and thousands of
rooms already in play, this mud is rocking.  We currently have 5 guilds
but will be soon adding more.

So if you want a new muddinbg adventure that combines medieval knights 
with a realm of chaos ruled by Warcraft Orcs and Dopehead teenagers
(these are areas, not the wizzes =-) then feel free to drop in at
204.118.244.4 3000  I am sure some of your wizzes will have some bad things
to say about us, we used to have a pretty bad rep, but under the new management
everything is changed ... see ya there.
[manson         ] [Dec 18] [Shadow Gate                                  ]

	I stumbled across a new MUD yesterday while HM was down and I really like it. It has the same out-of-the-box town structure as HM, a small and friendly playerbase, and a lot of possibilities. There is a need for coders, and a lot of players. It's fairly easy to advance now, enemies and items respan fast. I haven't got any lag yet. 
	I could really see the pace becoming what HM used to be. At least give it a shot. My name there is Gressil if I'm around.
The address is:

[anavrin        ] [Dec 22] [Realms of Chaos                              ]

    I used to play here a lot years ago, as Avun and others.
I plan to play here some again, but since I was last here I
learned to code and ended up in charge of a mud.  Because HM
was my first mud, and I still think is a good one, RoC has
some things in common with it, such that HM players might
like it.

    The address is: chaos.buckeyeweb.com 3456

    Thanks, HM, for providing such a board as this. :)

[lyr            ] [Jan  1] [re: shadowgate                               ]

folks,
I recently heard of an experience that 2 shadowgate admins
had with a holy mission player. It seems there had been around
three new characters log into shadowgate from the same site
Razor noticed this, and with multiple characters being illeagal
razor had asked the HM player if it was the same person. The HM 
player got quite offensive when simply questioned by razor and eranld
about the characters. As it goes, the HM player put a note on our
guild board, the note criticized the law team and the ethics of the 
mud. When in fact i believe the mud did nothing wrong. I hope this
doesnt sour anyones opinion of shadowgate, it is a very cool mud!:)
The logs have been made public if you want to check them at shadowgate.
Again, the mud feels upset about all the missunderstanding and hopes
that you all come check it out.

lyr

P.S. Mail me or finger me at shadowgate, maybe we can party together:)
PP.S. Hello Meecham, i love you works on shadowgate:)

[relgar         ] [Jan 27] [Bludgeon mud.aohell.org 9000                 ]

Check out Bludgeon... Alot simpler than most diku muds.
It is skill based and almost any character is possible.
Experience is the same per level so you know what to expect
but killing the same thing over and over again doesn't do you any
good. You'll get less exp each time so exploring is the best policy.
100 levels and possibility to remort into a special remort class.
Check it out. There's more than I've talked about here.
I play several characters but if you use the gossip line and ask for
Relgar I'll answer ya and we can go around and kill some stuff together.

Relgar, Jeremy, Me, Myself, and I.

Yes, I am crazy to use Windows 95...
but don't blame me... blame that dorkee millionaire guy from
Micro$oft named Bill Gates...
for making every fucking game and shit, needing Windows 95
to it...

by the way, I am planning to upgrade my weak 486dx2 66 mhz
to a at least a cyrix p150+

this upgrade will be in steps..
by buying the new board w/ CPU + memory and temp. moving every
board to the new board, then as money comes in upgrade each
add-on to a PCI version or better version and putting the 
old card back into the 486, it sense I will have two computers
in the end...

I am hosting a mud...

I need lib coders...

Theme: Futuritisc  (meaning you can put anything on it)

Currently the lib is bare bones...

I need first is to have a Wiz Structure, and Security (read/write)
structure..

anybody insterested...

just talk to me...

[nylakoorub     ] [Apr 11] [The 4th                                      ]

The 4th mud is coming along nicely.... I got a working
bin command system, and read/write system.

Next I going get the standard guild system implented

Once I get the lib finalized..

I would need coders for areas, guilds and such...

I am planning to create a Mud Council on there
which will include the God (me), Demi-God (Ripken), the
one or two Senior Arches, all the Arches, All Guild Masters
and a few lower level wizards, and one player for every X players
registered to the mud..

I am doing this, to prevent shit like what is happening here

This council will decide the flow of the mud...

 right now, there is no areas to explore..       

but if you like to drop in time to time and see what is going
on...
