[quilt          ] [Jul 18] [ideas                                        ]

Firstly i would like to say that the ideas of various centers is a good idea in an abstract sort of way. I think however that it would be a waste of time to have different log on points and similar ideas when we barely get more than 5 people regularly on 
here at any one time. In effect why waste the effort for so little gain.
With regard to the value of money and saving equipment...why not have a deposit for when the items are put in there..perhaps a flat price for any deposit
perhaps a percentage value of the item...
so for example..a dagger that i got from orc valley would cost virtually nothing to put into the bank whereas putting diamond platemail in there could bankrupt several solar systems..
additionally each day an automatic debit from your account might be made for each item that you have in there...sort of a rent or lease for equipment.
But perhaps most importantly for the depositing items in the bank...it would cost money to WITHDRAW the item from the bank too...sort of a bank charge for keeping the item there...so we can see here that even the richest players wo
have to start worrying about there finances after a period of time
As for the inn type idea ...i like it..but on the other hand it would invalidate my last 5 minutes of typing..and thieves SHOULD be able to break into inns...there are precious few things worth stealing as it is...
Especially with the online population as it is..

As for making it a pk offense to steal from inns...well why bother allowing people to steal from inns in the first place...if they steal from inns they become serial pkers..and they get banned..which hardly accomplishes anything..

Now i would like to suggest some sort of spyline for the bank..touching on airborne's question..how do you tell if a person has 20 coins in the bank or 20 millions? A possible solution would be that you you could somehow bribe those banks for other 
people's balances....which in turn would imply that you can somehow steal some of that balance from that other person?

Anyway..this is all off the subject of layouts..but i felt that my honour demanded that i interfere and get attention for myself..*grin*

OK  I would like to put and end to the saving objects talk.
There used to be, for a short time, the ability to save
objects, but that is not what HM is about. There will not
be any saving of objects over reboots. Between reboots
you can always drop them somewhere safe like a house.

It would also be a nice idea to seperate the popular zones as
much as possible.  Keeping them far apart will give players a 
reason to explore, and maybe even help them discover some new
areas, instead of going to the same place day after day.  

Also, many muds are set up with areas growing harder and harder as 
you move away from the 'center' of the mud.  This is good in some ways,
but it tends to make it somewhat predictable.  It can also bore
lower level players who can't do much exploring, and can annoy 
higher level players who have to walk all day to kill anything.

Just some thoughts...
[wilbie         ] [Jul 18] [oh, yea...                                   ]

It can also add to the realism of a mud if areas (especially really
big areas) can be accessed by several paths, not just one path
dedicated to that specific zone.  This may sound like an insignificant
point, but it greatly adds to the 'exploration' experience if people
have many different ways they can go.  One thing that really makes
a mud stand out is when you're really not sure when you've gone from
one zone to the next. :)
[relgar         ] [Jul 22] [Layout.                                      ]

Ok I've got more than my $.02 to put in here so you'll all have to bear with
me. First off, the fact that there is still some interest in the place
from the admins is encouraging. Just when you thought most people had given up
on the dump, someone strikes a match and lights the place on fire, whether it's
flaming each other or creative inspiration. Glad to see we're trying to do
something constructive this time. Having said that, lets get to my thoughts.
Wilbie, I like your idea on multiple entrances into an area. I've played
several muds(usually move points dependant) that  involved more than one
way to get somewhere and usually you could get to an area from several sides.
Not only did this allow the player to conserve some move points it provided
for some continuity in the mud. Most of the areas were just that AREAS and
not nameless portals that hung in a room that gave you access to another
dimension/plane/area.(i.e. Things like exits named 'enter', 'in', or the 
famous black marble archway, Kudos to Matt for an excellent area.) As for
'seamless' transition between areas... That requires some kind of guildlines
for room descriptions. In my opinion, areas with lots of rooms of the
same description are not only boring, but dull, unimaginative, and stupid.
All you need is one good description and you can force a player to spend
aikido
senseless time typing directions. If there is a huge tree in one place, why
not mention it in the surrounding areas. If you are standing at the docks
east of town you should be able to see smoke rising from the inn to the west.
Another thing I've observed is that rooms with lengthy descriptions(more than
8 or 9 lines) tend to get over looked. It may be a great room with excellent mental imagery but it
spams the player and is at times hard to read if there is alot of communication
going on(i.e. shouts, tells, etc.) I've noticed that alot of coders try to put alot of item descriptions
into a room description and don't add any items to the room. If there is
a chair in the room desc you should be able to look at it and see something
different than what is in the room desc.
But in order to be seamless coders of adjacent areas need to cooperate to
blend the rooms together. Adding views of the castle to the north from the
festering swamp that borders the castles lands adds epic scope to the
landscape.
Well in order to sum up this lengthy note and get you all back to your busy
hustle-bustle coding I will sum up. Essentially, lots of planning and organizing
areas to fit together doesn't do anything for game play except confuse players
for about 2 weeks unless they can mesh and work with each other.

[wilbie         ] [Jul 22] [confusion                                    ]

What's wrong with a little player confusion??  Do you want to know where 
everything is before you get to go look for it??

Part of the fun is the exploration.

[relgar         ] [Jul 24] [Re: confusion                                ]

Ahh yes, exploration is fun, but think of it this way. One morning
you wake up and everything is moved around. You try to go to your
favorite Dunkin' Donuts down the street only to find out that
there is now a gas station there. The street you live on has a
completely different name, and when you try to drive to work you
get completely lost and end up in the ghetto. What I'm tryin' to say
is that exploration is fun but the exploration should be for the
discovery of new areas. If you explore around and find an area you're
familiar with then you sort of say to yourself, 'Ok, I know where that
is now, lets see if I can't find this place.'
From what I've heard from several creators on here, it is very hard to
get a new area approved and put in, not because of poor coding, but
because noone wants to take the time to look at it, or they complain
about code formatting because of control characters on their screen.
The end justifies the means, lets get the place organized and let it
be, add areas where they will fit and inbetween put forests or plains
or mountain ranges, whatever is appropriate. If an area is getting old
and noone uses it then lets get rid of it and put something new and 
different in. Variety is the spice of life and if this place never
changes then people get bored and start trying to find ways to amuse
themselves(i.e. pking, bug exploitation, flaming, whatever...) or they
simply leave for something different. Unfortunately, I think alot of
people have already left and it saddens me to think that some of them
left because of a few people who got bored and started out with,
'Lets see what happens when I...'
Well anyway, I've gone on far longer than I intended and I've probably
lost a few of you long ago so that's it for now. If you want to flame
me, mail it to me don't spam the board.

Hmm --- I have to agree with Relgar here --
Maybe moving everything around isnt that good of an idea --
I remember I went on a 'mud' break and when I came back --
Everything had been moved.  I had to relearn the entire mud.
I wouldnt really like to have to go through all of that again.
However, I have noticed a few new areas that were recently added in.
That is when the fun of exploration comes in -- When you find a new
area -- and explore it -- you find all of the new things -- much more 
fun thaaan being totally lost :)

Nope, I didn't think you were flaming me.  Good point.

I wasn't suggesting it was good to change where already existing areas
are located.  The recent changes, and some future ones, are needed
to provide a little continuity, but I think that once everything is
logically put into place, it should indeed stay that way.

What I was suggesting is that the mud should be "confusing" as in
a player actually needing to LOOK for things in order to find them
the first time.  On a typical mud, you've got your cute little paths
leading to the newbies, giving them bunnies and bugs to kill, and you've
got your scary little paths leading to the higher level areas.
This is BORING in my opinion.  The mud should be ONE BIG PLACE, not a
whole bunch of smaller places.  Certain parts of this ONE BIG PLACE
should have tougher monsters than others, to be sure.  But it should 
still be one big place.  Just like in the real world, there are parts
that are safe for the younger, and parts only the big kids can go.
There are nice parts, and there are not so nice parts.

This is the one thing Wildsau did right.  Now if they just worked on
EVERYTHING ELSE they'd be okay :)

[relgar         ] [Aug  1] [Re: confused                                 ]

Absolutely I agree. The only problem with most areas is that the monsters
stay put. You will always find such and such a monster if you follow these
directions. If we have more roving monsters then there will be a little
variety in the areas. The only problem with that is if you have a roving
monster that is aggressive. It would quickly become a newbie slayer. That
would be both good and bad however. It might give some of the higher levels
something to do. Imagine the Haunter of the Dark walking through the center
of town. That would create some havoc and in order to remove the menace
a large group would have to get together and kill it.
Anyway, that's my $.02 for now, gettin' tired and I'm off to see the wizard.

[wilbie         ] [Aug  1] [Actually                                     ]

Another mud I play (Empire, out of Drexel) uses an idea much like that.  Every
so often there are "invasions" of demons, enemy kingdoms, or even aliens.
The players then ban together and defeat the evil...  It's a lot of fun.  And 
certainly something that could draw a crowd.  Generally, the invaders are
non-aggressive, and even the few that are will leave newbies alone.

I do like the idea of monsters roaming free, and yes they should not attack
lower level folks.  Perhaps they could even be blocked somehow
from entering certain zones, so that there are "safe" regions?

These are the type of ideas that will make HM kick ass once again.
[quazar         ] [Aug  3] [Monsties                                     ]

Yes, the wondering monsters idea is good --
With restrictions it could work --
To keep the 'big guyZ' away from the newbies, etc.

Personally I like the illogical layout.  It makes the place seem mystical
which is what it is supposed to be. I mean in Conan movies
they go from forests, into frozen ice castles. I dont see how trying
to make the place logical will improve HM.

And besides real life seems just the same. I mean one minute is warm here
and the next day, its like the Antartic.

i love the idea of roaming monsters:)

so all the newbie areas will be closest to the towns:)
we should have more than one town but the other

so they will be pretty much for higher levels and will
force higher levels to explore so they can find new

avoid making the movies last 12 hours.  
[marjolijn      ] [Aug 15] [invasion                                     ]

I love Wilbie's idea of invasions...
I can imagine a large crowd of gremlins entering the village,
picking up everything they find, and trying to steal your money,
or something... maybe even stopping you from leaving or entering
the village, so you (as higherlevel) are forced to fight them,
or as newbie forced to seek help...

Just some mind-boggles,

[relgar         ] [Aug 16] [Another idea.                                ]

One easy solution for avoiding "newbie killer" mobs is something I've seen
used on Tdome 1-3. It's called attitude on a monster. The monster is
unaggressive until the player reaches level 25 or so and then it will
attack the player. If we had a similar flag for monsters that would allow
for more wandering monster varieties without endangering our new players.

[axlrose        ] [Aug 20] [My comments...                               ]

I'm just more commenting on the above notes.

On Realms, every now and then, there will be a raid on the town.  Demons
and other nasty monsters try and make their way to south of the church.
Some of the players are part of the militia, which band together to stop
said monsters.  There have been pros and cons with the militia I heard
on how they deal with new recruits and the cliche of it all.  My complaint
with it was those of an evil nature could not help the monsters.  It was
either you're a militia member killing the monsters or you left alone.

I'm showing my age here, but long, long ago, a wizard messed with the code
to someone's area and the multiplying draconians ran amock across the mud.
Because the start room saw no monsters present, it kept cloning them over
and over.  Ahhh, the days of yesteryear.

Some good comments about starting newbies beginning their life in their
'home' surroundings and having to venture forth to make something of them-
selves.  Also how guilds should charge for advancement in rank while 
training in new skills.

One thing that could help players when the areas get rearranged slowly is
to have NPCs wander the towns murmuring about "Earthquakes, floods, and 
the wrath of the gods affecting the humble people!"  As an example and off
the top of my head, a battered warrior drools.....

"Shao Kahn came through town and *gasp* *wheeze* a new portal... *cough*
opened west... *groan* *croak*.

So either he dies or you kill him if you want.

More as I think of it...

[axlrose        ] [Aug 20] [Another idea...                              ]

Another idea that popped off the top of my head this afternoon...

It seems that whenever a new area opens, you will find a shop for armor,
healing, and weapons.  Perhaps there should be a limit on the number in
the whole mud.  Along with that, there should be a limited number of
coinage allowed out per shop.  That is, say a major city has a shop that
is pretty active.  Players should be able to sell everything and any-
thing at full value, with maybe but the most deadly of equipment stored
away.  Full coins offered for goods.  Now take some small little village
out in the middle of the tundra.  Unless they had a steady
supply of gold, selling something there should only net about 10% of the
value, with more powerful stuff horded away "for when the goblins come
down from the mountains in the spring..."

For the coding aspect, let's see - maybe the shop should have a set_money
at say 1,000,000 coins.  Because this is a large city, the percentage is
100%.  As the shop buys and sells, the amounts are subtracted and added 
to the base of set_money.  Now for the little village out in the tundra,
perhaps it is only 10%, or its set_money at only 100,000.  Better still,
make it at 1% (goblins were active last year) at set_money at 10,000.  
High roller player struts in and drops 50 goblin swords at 100 coins each
and the goblin king's sword at a whopping 5000 coins.  The shop buys them
all and takes say (100% - 1%) = 99% of the goblin swords for future deal-
ings with the goblins and the king's sword because value > 1000 coins,
after all said and done, the shop has 0 coins left and maybe 1 goblin wea-
pon in storage.

Of course, in the big city, all the weapons would be for sale (they should
have guards to defend borders so...) and the cash flow is good.  But the
city is 50 rooms away and the player is on a roll in the goblin caves so
walk all the way over there and then all the way back, or take a loss and
later sell goblin goods at 1 coin a piece, because with the shop's money 
at 0, which can be used to say if set_money = 0, set to 1.

Might take some work for the wizards involved, especially those that have
areas with a basic sword = 1000 coins right away.  Downgrade the values 
for everything by 10% to start and see what happens.

More ideas as they appear.

Actually it went from a forest to an Ice Caslte because of a magician,
and I guess HM has magic in it so why not unusal things like that?
[texas          ] [Mar 26] [exploration and areas                        ]

the only true way to have several areas that properly interconnect
with each other so that players are not aware they have moved on
from one area to another is for wizards to work together.

I have been on and off this mud for several years, and its a very
rare occurrance that two wizards even consider working together
to make two different, yet compatible areas.  Maybe wizzes should
stop bitching about these problems and start haveing constructive
chats with each other to produce areas that interconnect easily
and with a minimum of hassle.

Too many areas are written without due concern for the people who
are actually going to be in them (in case you arent aware who they
are, they are called PLAYERS!).

In future before coding an area think in advance exactly where you
think it should fit and why, and then maybe talk to the wizard whose
areas you are going to be interconnecting with so that some of the 
rooms you write fit with the themes of all the areas concerned.

Yes, this does mean if you want to code a 400+ Room area that spans
a large section of the mud then you are gonna have to talk to a lot
of wizzes.  If they arent around anymore, then use common sense.
We were all born with it, so why not try using it sometimes.
