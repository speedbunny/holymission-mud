of the MUD.

A man who has never seem the city walks into town and sees RailRoad tracks
and stops to inspect them. After hearing the 'Woooo-wooooo!' of the train,
hes hit by a train and spends many weeks in the hospital. After he recoupes,
he hears a teapot from the other room, steaming and ready to be taken off.
The man runs into the room and beats the teapot into a small peice of 
twisted metal. A nurse walks in. The nurse asks, "Why did you do that?"
He replies, "You gotta get these things when their small!" 

Three men are forced to stay in the same bed because of lack of hotel space
in the inn. In the morning, they discuss the dreams they had. The man on the
right says, "I dreamed I gotta hand job." The man on the left says, "Me too."
The man in the middle said, "I dreamed I was skiing." 

A married couple woke up one morning. But alas, the man woke up with a vigina,
and the woman with a penis. They both looked at each other in shock. They both
got up and and started to go their separete ways. The husband said 
"Where are you going?" And she said, "Seeing whats so good about 
spanking the monkey." And she said, "What are you going to do?" And he said,
"Seeing how far I can launch a ping-pong ball."

A man walking out of town sees a sigh by a farm that reads,
'1000 dollars to whoever donkey to laughing'. The man walks up to the farmer
and finds out the donkey has been sad for a while, and said he could do it.
He confidently walks into the barn, and moments later, walks out and the donkey
is laughing loudly. He doesnt tell the farmer what he did, takes the money and 
leaves the farm on his way, continuing out of town. A month later, 
the man returns and the farm has a sign: '1000 dollars for whoever 
makes my donkey cry.' Once again, the man walks into the farm and is told ever
since before, the donkey wont stop laughing. The man walks into the barn and a 
few moments later, the farmer hears the donkey cring uncontrollably. 
The farmer asks what the man did, and wouldnt give him the money until he tells
what he has done. "First," The man said, "I told him my penis was bigger than his.
 And just now in the barn, I showed him."

What did Monica Lewenski say under oath? "I swallowed but I did'nt inhale."
