[mangla         ] [Nov 23] [Re: not                                      ]

Can you please post more detail than that? I tried the one
place I could think of in orc valley, but it was not it.
Knowing the room or how to get there is a great bonus.

This is the local strong point of the orcs. There is an entrance to a small
room to the north.
    There are two obvious exits: north and south
Nine Orcs.

this room?

All I can see is the room that Smorlok described. Next time
you see this happen mail or post the error messages that you
get and I will take a look at those. If you do not see the
error messages, then "tail /lpmud.log" and let me see what is
in there.

I see that another player has posted a bug regarding weight not being subtracted
Mcloud had this problem earlier. This was corrected by having Mcloud quit and re-login.  
I was not present when the bug occured, so I do not know all the details.
I do know that other players have had similar problems, also corrected by the same method.

If anyone knows why this happens and/or how to fix it, I would appreciate it if they did
correct it or post here regarding why it cannot be fixed.  Thank You.
[exos           ] [Jan 22] [Re: Weight bug                               ]

We need more info to fix it.

What items they had, one might be buggy, or have a buggy drop function.
If someone gets this bug, let someone know.
[mangla         ] [Jan 22] [Re: Weight bug                               ]

Normally caused by a wizard using move_object instead
of transfer. Find the guilty object and it can normally be
fixed lickety-split!

[turbo          ] [Mar 12] [too many of type 'other'                     ]

this is a bug, but I dont know how important it is.
1.) you can only wear the top-most ring in a stack of rings
  (if you have 8 rings in your inventory [the max you can wear] you can only wear ring,
     (you cannot wear ring 6)
2.) after you have reached your limit of 8 rings, attempting to wear another
  doesnt return any messages.  no 'you are out of fingers' or anything.
3.) after you have read your limit of 10 'other' armors, attempting to wear another
results a bug
"Index out of bounds"  "program: sys/living.c" "object : sys/wiz#16920"  "line   : 743"

just thought you should be informed.

Hi, I seem to remember this from when I was playing...

Allsiante complained today that he had a steel key and was trying
to unlock a steel door that wouldn't open.

Now some of Padrone's was recoded to use Uglymouth's code.
The door he was trying to open wanted a "cellkey" not a steel key.

Whether the steel key is the right key for the cell or not, I am
uncertain.  Just wondering if anyone knows if there is a cell key,
or if the steel key needs to be recoded to be a cell key.

Thanks

Red
