For the record...
I took responsibility for Brainsprain as a wiz.
I knew what his past was, here and on other MUDs.
I knew what he could do.
PLUS, he performed all the requirements.

And as such he has a well coded area nearly finalized, which
is more than most of the newest wizzes have.

Lay off him.

i remember vess he was a real asshole as a player..
some player will never be able to show if they can be good wizzes or not
even some very good wizzes got bannished like muzzmuzz (or muzmuz dont remeber 
eh correct name)
its a shame when a good wiz gets deleted but if a useless player gets kicked
it shouldnt be a big problem
we had so many bad players in the past
hehe i was once a pker too killed many many players some for fun most
because they tried to kill me or a friend that couldnt defent against them
these days i only pk if someone attackes me or attacked me many times like
a sertain thief
now if he gets online and i'd get my hands on him hes dead..
why? because he tried to kill me over 15 times by now and never succeded
well thise note is getting to long now

[montoya        ] [Apr 26] [Re: voting                                   ]

I don't see why most wizzes talk about their areas by saying
it has such-and-such a number of rooms like the more there are
the bigger the status symbol it is.  It just seems to me like
Loadsamoney whipping out a large bunch of fivers and shouting
"OI YOU.... Have a look at my WAD !!".

The point is it's not the number of rooms that's important
it's whether or not the area is well coded, from a programmer's
and player's point of view (ie. is it FUN to play in).

This may not seem important to some people, but I've seen
plenty of HUGE areas that IMHO where BORING to play in and had
BORING quests. (Anyone here remember Gambit? Do the words
Mortal Kombat mean anything to you? Perhaps you'll know what
I'm talking about - but that's just one example off the top of
my head.)

So couldn't you find so better way of describing your areas in
this kind of environment please. X no. of rooms is such a turn
off.  (not that I get aroused at the thought of mudding before
anyone uses that particular flame against me!)

Adding his two-penneth worth.

Pull the other one it'll set off the fire alarm !!

Muzmuz was an asshole... I even met him (briefly) in rl and
take it from me briefly is the ONLY way to meet him (if at all!)

[evil           ] [Apr 29] [Hold pk'd me for no apparent reason          ]

Some guy named Hold pk'd me out of the blue.
According to the player news ther eis some 
zero tolerance policy and I expect that it
be upheld in this case. I have never met
this guy Hold, he has never met me till
today. Plus I am level 6 and he is level
20 something. I dont think this was fair.
Please, if the rules are going to be honored
on this mud, do something about it wizards.
Thanks,
   Evil
[evil           ] [Apr 29] [Re: Hold killed me                           ]

He states that he is avenging another char.
I would think that being pked, so logging
in as your more powerful char to go do 
revenge is not exactly what the wizzes
here had in mind. Therefore Hold is 
guilty for violating the 0 tolerance
rule that the Wizzes put in effect.
(guilty in my eyes)

Let justice be served!

Evil

p.s. Not only does he break the rules with his player
he breaks them with his wizard too. Like we need that 
kind of person on the mud, but what do you expect from
a third world citizen

if hungarians are third world citizens, and no rules of the civilized world apply to them, then it will be completetely lawful, my septian, when i kill your character upon sight.

I would probably kill Septian/Evil again if I 
had the means just I did when he kept telling me
how Hungary was a Third World country, how he will
exterminate every nigger who logs in from there and
then kept repeating 'die, nigger, die!'.

I'm sorry I had to be removed to voice this opinion.
[mangla         ] [Apr 29] [Re: my 0 tolerance                           ]

Facts:
Hold was a wizards character.
Hold killed Evil to avenge a PK on the wizard character from long ago.
        (Long on here being anything over 2 months.)
Only the player killed is allowed to avenge thier death within a
        reasonable amount of time, using the killed char. (See time frame above.)
Wizards are not supposed to meddle in mortal affairs, or by thier actions
        "mess it up" for the player.
There is an advertised zero tolerance policy.
This was a multiple PK over several hours time, so this was not an accident.


Now can you argue those facts ?  (Besides the time frames.)

Hi, 
Just stopping as i said i would.
Evil is a dork, no question.  Saying someone is a nigger imply's
that the "someone" told them that they are a person of color.
Why'd you do that?  
Question: Am i black?  Am i white?
Be reasonable.  Make sense.
I'm whatever color you chose to precieve me as.

Be good.  Don't hate.  Life is a good thing if you 
explore it.

Let's get your facts straight:

Nigger has nothing to do with color.
It has something to do with ones attitude.
I'm sorry you were taught in a racist environment.
We tolerate your ignorance.
It's all pink in the middle.
It's all black with your eyes closed.
The only color I care about is green.
And I am going to die high :)

In case you didn't notice the world doesn't judge what
is acceptable by using you as a barometer.  Some people
are offended when called a "nigger".  That is, in fact, 
harrassment, which is not tolerated here thankfully.

Tatsuo has been banished from Holy Mission.
He has done some motivation. That is admitted, but
his subversive and abusive behavior had to be dealt with.

This does not mean that wizards will stop coding, but
there will be some ill feelings on the mud. If you feel you
