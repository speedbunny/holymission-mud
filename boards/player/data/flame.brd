I don't think anyone (least of all me) has any interest in your random rants and

[wilbie         ] [Jan 11] [random rants and raves                       ]

Actually, I don't think her rants and raves are at all random.  I think
they are in fact planned out and deliberate.  For example, they all 
contain logically correct sentence structure and valid English syntax.
The probability of having those two things by a random means is very
small indeed.  

Futhermore, each rant and rave has a similar context.  This would further
suggest a pattern, rather than a random phenomenon.

And example of a random rant or rave would be:
Flying gopher red banana yesterday!

or 

Thing cow and but or hyperbole yesterday?

Actually, an example of a truly random rant or rave would be:
