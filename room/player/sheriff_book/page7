                                    PROFANITY

Profanity is not tolerated in any language. Profanity is defined as
anything not appropriate for a family atmosphere or children.

Profanity also includes the shouting or echoing of control characters. 
(ie. NO BEEPS!)

Shouting Profanities will draw a warning and then punishment appropriate
to the crime.
