                                 PLAYER KILLING

Player Killing is legal in certain circumstances. You are allowed to PK
in self defense, or in retaliation for being robbed. If a PK settles a
dispute it is allowable. 

Serial Player Killing is illegal and is grounds for instant banishment. 
If you PK you had better have a GOOD reason. 

The contracting of another to perform a PK (even for a revenge killing) is
frowned upon and considered highly illegal. Both the contractor and the
contractee will be punished for this crime. 

No external items may be used for performing a multiple PK. 

ALL PKs are subject to wizard ruling
