messages "Ethereal Cashimor\n**\nSubj: Re: Maze\n\nDate: May 27\n\nI had several different ideas concerning a maze of doors. Some of them might\nbe workable, some impossible, but I'll make a list for you here. I don't\nthink I'll implement them myself and I haven't got a finished solution...\nHere it comes...\n\n1) The general idea about doors: they have locks. You can hide keys behind\\\n   other doors and make a nice maze in the meantime...\n\n2) The idea of the well: when you open one door, another one won't open. In\n   combination of one way doors or doors at different distances from each\n   other this forces the players to cooperate in the maze.\n\n3) Doors can be trapped. When you try to unlock or picklock a door the trap\n   will spring, leaving the player with less hits, a terrible curse or some\n   thing like that...\n\n4) The nice idea of doors closing when you open one. This way the maze can\n   get quite confusing. Open this door, and 5 others close and can't be\n   opened. Very nice...\n   This is very interesting with two players in the maze. If one opens a door\n   the other sees one close again...\n\n5) Timed doors. Doors that only open one minute each five minutes. Or close\n   after a while. Time can make it very complicated.\n\n6) And look for another example of an interesting door to my gate in the\n   objects directory. This is not really something for a maze, but just the\n   same. I have to give it another side though...\n\n7) The most terrible of all: a door that walks through the maze of doors. A\n   special gate that looks like the others but replaces them sometimes. With\n   a special command (for example: put it into the info and use a scroll of\n   identify, if we have one) you can check if a door isn't the wrong one...\n\nA lot of fun, anyway. I hope I have given some ideas...\n\nGreetings from Cashimor...\n\n**\nEthereal Cashimor\n**\nSubj: Languages\n\nDate: Jul 21\n\nHi Herp!\n\nI thought I saw something in the race/master that has to do with languages,\nand I saw some naming with it. I don't know if it's going to be implemented,\nbut I don't think the names are very well. They are a mixture of Tolkien\nEnglish (elven), English (dwarfish, orcish, trollish) and Quenya (westron).\nI think we must choose ONE of these possibilities (preferable Quenya, but\nyou may choose any other of course)\n\nTolkien English:\n\nhuman -> human\nelven -> elvish\nwestron -> hobbitish\ndwarfish -> dwarvish\norcish -> orcish\ntrollish -> trollish\n\nEnglish:\n\nhuman -> human\nelven -> elfish\nwestron -> hobbitish\ndwarfish -> dwarfish\norcish -> orcish\ntrollish -> trollish\n\nQuenya:\n\nhuman -> westron\nelven -> bethleur/sindarin/quenya (one of these three)\nwestron -> kuduk\ndwarfish -> khuzdul\norcish -> orcish/morbeth (one of these two)\ntrollish -> orcish/morbeth (one of these two)\n\nHope to be of service with this. There are more language names in Quenya,\nand I'm glad to give them all to you if you want to.\n\nGreetings,\n\nEthereal Cashimor\n\n**\nEthereal Cashimor\n**\nSubj: Languages\n\nDate: Jul 29\n\nHere is the, still incomplete list, of languages by Tolkien or ICE:\n\nKhuzdul : Dwarves\nUmitic  : Half-dwarves\nBethleur: Wood elves\nSindarin: Grey elves\nQuenya  : High/Deep/Fair elves\nWestron : Common\nAdunaic : High man\nMorbeth : Trolls/Orcs\nOrcish  : Orcs\nWaildyth: Animals\nPukael  : Wood men\nKuduk   : Hobbits\nRohirric: Horse men\n\nThere are many more languages, but I again forgot the book.

Also they should\napply to a lvl 40+ for a sponsorship. (* sponsorship will be explained\nbelow*) who will, at the end of the week, want to be sent mail detailing\nhow to \n\ta: Code a basic room with one monster and a few items to\n\t   look at.\n\tb: Code a room with at least one add_action in it.\n\tc: Code a room with a variable number of monsters with \n\t   Variable statistics.\n\n\tand also will want to ask a few questions on the docs and on the\nguidelines to ensure a good understanding of the above.\n\tIf a wizard breaks the rules, then they shall be demoted to this\nlevel again. They will have to stay here for at least a fortnight before\nreapplying for sponsorship. If they break the rules twice they will be \ndemoted to a newbie.\n\tApprentices cannot be killed, but they also cannot code, clone or\nmove objects about. They can teleport and echoall and emoteall.\n\nWiz - Level 31.\n\n\tAt this level, they should be able to code a castle. Any problems\nthey have, if they cant find an answer in the docs,k they should ask\neither their sponsor or other wizards, or a senior, arch or god.\n\nSenior - Level 40.\n\n\tTo obtain this level the wizard must have either done something\nimportant for the adminsitration of the mud, or built a quest. Whichever\nit is they should then have posted a note on the notice board, and then\nall wizards can say whether they approve or dissapprove of the promotion\nand why. If the promotion gets approval then the wizard is promoted. At\nthis level, the wizard should be concentrating a little less on straight\ncoding and more on helping lower wizards with coding problems, and bug\nhunting/solving. They should have full read access and partial write\naccess (* all except player.o files and obvious ones like player.c etc *)\nIf you have sponsored someone, then YOU are responsible for them and what\nthey code. If it breaks the guidlelines you have to tell them to fix it.\nIf it dosent, demote them to a level 30.\n\nArch - Level  50.\n\n\tAn arch is the top trouble shooter for debugging and coding\nproblems. They should have full read/write access to enable this. In \nshort, they have to do approximately the same job as a senior except \nwith more bug hunting and less personal coding, and more powers to work\nwith.\n\nGod - Level 51+.\n\n\tPretty self explanatory.\n\n\nGeneral rules:\n\n\tNo player helping/hindrance. \n\tIf a player comes to you and tells you that they got killed by\n a bug, you order them to mail an arch or god about it. Let the arches\nor gods sort that one out, its not your problem.\n\tIf you want to test an area, use either the test character or a\npersonal secondary character. DO NOT use players for this.\n\tDo not open partly finished areas/quests.\n\tDo not create super weapons or armours. Quest items are allowed\nto be a little more powerful but not excessively so.\n\tDo not go around healing players. Thats helping them, and it \ntakes away from the actual game itself.\n\n\tREMINDER: Breaking the above rules once means demotion to\n\t\t  a level 30. Breaking them twice means being demoted\n\t\t  to a level 1.\n\nPlease reply to me about what you think of this and the monster stats.\n\nOne last thing about the wizard levels. You could make it that certain\narches are in charge of certain parts of coding, i.e. quests,\nmonsters, players, rooms, special functions etc.\n\n**\nouzo\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: hi du arschficker\n\nDate: Mar 19\n\nHi !\nwenn ich lust und laune hab,\nwerd ich dir dein dummes mud abdrehen wixer !! \n\n            Laugh *** whisky the god \n\n**\ntony\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: prison\n\nDate: May  6\n\nSomeone imprisoned my batman character for no reason.\nCan you free it please?\nAnthony\n\n**\nanimal\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: Cheating\n\nDate: May  7\n\nHmmm, it seems someone is cheating with my quest.....\nI noticed NO ONE killed the King to get his head...\nBUT line 652 shows Carefree throwing the head.......\nLook at /players/animal/quest    There is NO WAY to get the head\nunless 1) you kill the King, or 2) a wiz clones it....\nPlease check into it..I guess I should make the head clone proof....\n\nAnimal\n\nP.S.

I know I'm quite new and all but Airborne can vouch\nfor me. It seems rather irrelevant how old I am to the mud and all.\nI thought the post of sheriff was one which required quick decision\nmaking and accurate decisions too. If I do not qualify for the post\nfor some reason, please let me know why and I'd appreciate some info\non how someone can become sheriff. I've always wanted to be a sheriff\nand the position seems more attainable now than before. It's not the\npower or anything that attracts me, it's the position and the duty.\nI know it's hard and some players just are natural bitching people.\nI never aimed at being more than a sheriff to tell the truth. Sure,\nsomeday I'll want to be an arch but that's up to the admins. Anyway,\nthat day is a long time from now. Maybe not so long as I expect from\nthe way I'm learning and absorbing stuff. That's another subject\ntotally though. Let me end it now by saying I appreciate the time and\neffort reading this, seeing how busy you are and all.\n\nColossus\n\n**\njames\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: App sandy\n\nCc: james llort\nDate: May 24\n\nSandy was someones test character. They set the level to 30 using one\nof the testcharacter commands, and this made it into an Apprentice wizard.\n\nthey couldnt lower the level of the character once this happened (of course),\nso i edited the file, changing the level to 1. This didnt work. I removed\nthe sandy.o file from /players, that didnt work either...\n\nwhen you try to recreate the 'sandy' character, it tries to clone sys/app,\nand i'm assuming that something in master.c is keeping a record of\nall wizards by scanning the .o files on reboots or some other method, \nand i dont know how to reset the database for this....\n\nthe next reboot may fix the problem, but regardless someone needs to fix something,\nso that this isnt easy to do (the setlevel testchar command shouldnt allow level 30)\n\n  -James\n\n**\njames\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: udp stuff for Amylaar parser\n\nDate: May 26\n\nSome wizards i know would like to get the udp stuff that you have here, so they can\nadd it to their mud. They run Amylaar parser too, apparently...\n\nletr me know if its OK to give the stuff to em, and what they need besides the\nfiles in /udp\n\n  -James\n\n**\njames\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: clone_object\n\nCc: llort patience kbl james\nDate: May 27\n\nI added a simul_efun for clone_object, that checks to see if the previous\nobject is a non-cloned monster. IE, if someone defines a monster by\ninheriting monster.c, i will detect all the original loaded objects of\nthis type. All such objects are logged in /log/BAD_CLONE_OBJECT , though\nthe clone_object is still allowed to proceed as normal.\n\nNow, alot of unnecessary cloning of armor, weapons, money, etc is done\nby the original monster objects, when in reality all that we usually want\nis for the clones of these monsters to be cloning equipment. \n\nSo, should we try to have the simul_efun refuse to clone objects in this \ncase (actually, we would probably need to return some dummy  object pointer\ninstead of returning a value of 0)...OR, should we have the simul_efun of\nclone_object() log the error message to the error log of the wizard who\nowns the monster, and make them add a check to each monster?\n\n  -James\n\n**\nkbl\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: Yes\n\nDate: May 27\n\nOk, what I take it as, we do not want the, ie: elf.c file to inside it clone\nitems, instead we would like it to be cloned, then clone items and transfer\nthen to the elf... so we are not cloning inside of a cloned object. Thats\nwhat I got out of that, sounds resonable to me, less recursive cloning.\nIs that what YOU thought it said, or did I read it wrong, and I read it\nseveral times to get it straight.\n\n                                                        Kbl\n\nps: How did your final come out??

There shouldnt be any master-objects\nthat are monsters in the game, that need to clone other objects... The\nonly master-object-monster that comes to mind is /obj/shut.c (Armageddon),\nand i dont think thats considered an NPC, but if it is, i know it\ndoesnt need to clone armor and weapons...\n\n  -James\n\n**\njames\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: udp port\n\nDate: Jun  7\n\nwhat is our udp port?\n\n**\nmatt\n**\nTo: patience\nSubj: There's no place like home\n\nCc: herp llort cashimor\nDate: Jun 11\n\nHello.\n\n\tI just want to tell you that I don't want to have to leave this mud.\nI love it here, it's like home to me since I've been playing for so long.\nIt's just that when such drastic changes occur in a short time, changes which\nare not at all discussed with other wizzes let alone players, it upsets me.\nFor instance the new name information. The insertion of the race in the middle\nof their title disturbs the flow of titles; they don't sound as good.\nAlso the \"is standing here\" and \"is here\" appended to the end of objects in a\nroom isn't necessary, especially for items which have a special short name\nwhich isn't compatible (i.e. doesn't sound right) with \"is here\" appended.\nIf a wiz wants the object to have \"is here\" he can just add that to the short\ndesc of the object. It shouldn't be mandatory.\n\tThe changes to \"who\" are excellent. I like the new who command. But I\nthink that if you took out the race from the titles, and instead made a\n\"who <race>\" command or some such thing, that would be better. Races can get\na list of their members already, after all, by typing \"race\".\n\tI have more suggestions and opinions which I do not have space to\ninclude here. Please read my note on the inner adv. board about the meeting,\nfor I would like to discuss things with you, and not have to leave HM.\n\tGreetings, \n\tMatt\n\n**\nmatt\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: What will happen now ?\n\nDate: Jun 12\n\nHello.

I really\nhave no problem with this actually. I would have prefered being more involved\nbut I can overlook such thought because it was Patience and Llort system ok'd\nby you I was told. The problem with the phase in was in my view errored as\nfollows:\nA) Mud should have been limited access to wizards only and display a\nentrance message to the wizs stating briefly why the limitation.\n\nB) Mud could have then been enhanced without worry about wizards being\nbombarded by user complaints. (I know, but they are only children *giggle*)\n\nC) Docs would have then been provided so the functions and abilities\neffected could have been corrected before letting players come back, maybe\ntwo/three days max.\n\nNow, I understand that these wizards complainted like a boat load of children\non a training crusie... hell with them! They do not dictate policy of coding\nenhancements to the mudlib! Shit, man... bunch of pissants... all could have\nbeen avioded... as I outlined about.

So I temporarily changed it back to\nthe old way, so it would work.\n\tAfter reading about all the recent changes, I think that it would\nbe a good idea for me to remove this guild from the mud, at least\nfor now. It will be very difficult to adapt it to the new skill system\nand all future changes that may come up, because of the way it's coded;\nSo I think maybe I should remove it so I can have time to work on it\nand adapt it. Perhaps I'll make another new guild entirely, that isn't\nso complicated code-wise. Tell me what you think about the removal ...\nI'd be willing to write a new, skill-based guild instead (and I can do it).\nAnyway, thanks for your help, and sorry about the trouble. ;)\n\t- Matt\n\n**\nkbl\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: found your chatline bugger\n\nDate: Oct 22\n\nHerp...\n\nThe tell_chat function should have been a:\n\n   private int tell_chat(mixed *ob,string msg) {\n\ninstead, you had:\n\n   private void tell_chat(mixed *ob,string msg) {\n\nBut there's return statements in that tell_chat function...

Now I don't know what he may have told you, but I\nwill tell you what I've said to him:\n\nOne day he asked me whether he could become guildmaster of thieves.\nAt that point, I had mentioned to him several reasons why I would not\ndo so:\n1) Thieves is a rather ok guild that works like fine. \n2) When the skill system is coming (which will be in a week now, I hope),\n   there will be a lot of things to reconsider, among which appointing\n   new guildmasters.\n3) Given these points it would only cause players to whine when they're\n   new abilities one day, and take them back the next coz of changes.\n   All we want now is a stable, well running mud.\n4) There were other people that had asked for the job, which I could\n   have given it before. For those same reasons, I did not.\n\nSo now I don't think Kasgaroth had the right to come to you 'asking' for\nthe job. I was purposely not looking for a new guildmaster, and he knew.\nApart from that, I don't like his note on thief board (nr 22), stating\nthat their GM is gone and that they should now go complaining for a new\none. Of course you will cause players to start whining that way.\n\nSo now you know the story from this side, I wanted to ask you if it's ok\nwith you to remove Kasgaroth as guildmaster of thieves (running it from\nyour dirs again, leaderless). At the appropriate time I will reconsider\nthe matter, in conference with the arches. I understand you put someone\nyou think would do well to look after your guild, but as arch of guilds,\nI don't think it all too wise. Please let me know what you think of this.\nSee you around (:-),\n\n\t\t\tViking Lord Uglymouth\n\nP.S.

Now\nalthough the very act of promotion can only be done by an arch, Dice said\nhe and Portil actually tested apprentices on various occasions. And he told\nme that he thought mentors were allowed to take the tests. As far as I knew\nat the time (and still do!), only archwizards should test apprentice wizards\nfor promotion to newwiz.\n\nNow I think it is important to get this thing cleared out soon, to prevent\nfurther misunderstandings.\n1) I am against allowing all mentors to test their students. Plain and simple\n   because many mentors may be able to code, and help other to learn to code,\n   but are definitely not experienced enough to see what's needed for\n   apprenctices to qualify (Dice took this personally, hence the arguments).\n2) The test should not be just a formality, I think. I know it's hard to\n   have people fail, but I think that it should be possible in very sad\n   cases. Now we're getting a lot of new newwizzes, it's important to start\n   paying some attention to their education. That's in out common benefit!\n3) Remains the question if Lords should be able to test. What follows is my\n   personal opinion, but also the way I think it's arranged best: Lords\n   should not be allowed to take the test. For two reasons. Lords often\n   still don't have the experience arches have (I mean, why else would there\n   be a level difference?). And most important, the responsibility lies with\n   the arches in the end anyway. So if a Lord would test, and approves, and\n   the new proves to be a flunk, then he could easily say that they arches\n   should have had better control over what Lords do. I'm not saying this is\n   happening now, but I DON'T ever want to be manoeuvered in that situation.\n\nAs said, last remarks are on personal basis. I would like to get your\nopinions on the matter, so we can come to a final decision, and stick\nto that decision together. The arches must be on one line if things are\nto work properly here. At least on such matters, I think.\nSee you around,\n\n\t\t\t\tViking Lord Uglymouth\n\n**\nwesley\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: Manchester addresses\n\nDate: Jun  6\n\nuk.ac.umist.cn.pad: umist PAD\n.cn.xa: reverse PAD\n.cns: central services sun\n.co.ap: apollo cluster\n.co.ist: info systems tech lab 2\n.co.mac: Macintosh gateway\n.co.mp: sun 600 series\n.csc: control systems centre mail computer\n.dir: umist dir server\n\n**\nuglymouth\n**\nTo: matt\n Re:   re: promotion to newwiz\nCc: galadriel,herp,airborne,warlord,silas,cashimor\nDate: Jun 14\n\nHi,\n\nThanks for mail, Matt.\nWell, as I also discussed with Airborne (and now from your\nmail as well), I think we mostly agree on how things should\nbe done. I plan to write a doc soon on this practice (who is\nallowed, and what should be tested), which you then can comment\non. If ok, then I'll take it up in the docs.\n\nSo, I guess we all agree on the fact that only arches should\ntake the final test. I don't mind having mentors taking preliminary\ntests, but it should be clear to the appr that it's only just that.\nWhatever way mentors and students like to work is completely up to\nthem, as far as I'm concerned. For us it's the result that counts.\nAnother important point you mention is that the test is not only\na test of knowledge, but also a good opportunity to plug up some\nholes in the apprs knowledge, and explain other things you as arch\nthink are important for the soon-to-be-newwiz to know. Also, I let\nthem ask any question they want to ask, or tell me when something\nI say is not entirely clear to them. It benefits the newwiz, and\nalso gives a much more relaxed tone to the test, and is I think a\ngood way to show them that the arches aren't as bad and egocentric\nas they are stereotypically portraited ;-)\nI'll write the doc, and let you all know when it's finished, so\nwe can make the decision public knowledge, for all to adhere to.\nSee you around,\n\n\t\t\tViking Lord Uglymouth\n\n**\ncashimor\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: Current balance of power\n\nDate: Nov 10\n\nDear Herp,\n\nThere are a few problems, both in real life and here, that make it impossible\nfor me to continue working as arch-wizard for you for a while.

The person who\nused Gambit had a wide knowledge of the mud and the people on\nthe mud since the times of him watching me. All he wanted\nto do was learn how to code but got carried away and\ndecided to fuck up my character. I have even gone to the length of\ntelling the network service I am on and they are dealing with\nthe matter as well. Please let me return and fix what he has done wrong..\nThe person was not Axlrose so he didnt do it...\n\nPlease get in touch with me on this matter at:\n\ngnr@netcom.com\ngrjv16a@prodigy.com\n\nAgain thanx you....

Like before all major recoding started. I don't\nhave any particular plans with it, but I would not mind having\na copy of the mudlib I have been working on for quite some\ntime now. Would be too bad to loose these things, even if\nthings will get back in recoded form in the 'new' HM.\nSee you around,\n\nUglymouth\n\n**\naramirtoo\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: Aramir\n\nCc: patience\nDate: Jun 13\n\nSince February I have been unable to acces my character on this MUD Aramir.\n\nI now have time to do some serious coding, but someone seems to have changed my passwo\nmy password.

When ftping to the\nmud ftp server I cannot do cd /* as its to a FOREIGN AREA, yet I can do cd\n~user</bla> (mud for instance).  Once in the directoryI cannot do ls,\nas it's in a foreign area.  But, I can do this:\nls ~mud/lib/<secured directory>\nget ~mud/lib/dir/<secured file>\n\nSeeya,\n     Kasgaroth\n\n**\nuglymouth\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: moving out\n\nDate: Jul  3\n\nAve sir Herp,\n\nWell, now all of a sudden the department has found a big hole\nin their budget, so they decided now that they're not going to\nextend my job like they more or less agreed upon when I started\nthere last year. Meaning: though I'll keep net access for some\ntime, I don't have a terminal available regularly anymore.\nSo I won't be able to log on often to do proper arch work anymore.\nTherefore I want to ask you to retire me. I don't like it, but I\ndon't think I should keep a position occupied so that no one\nbenefits from it. If this leads to my deletion at Wildsau, then\nso be it. It's out of my hands till I got a new job someday...\nAnyway, I want to thank you for the possibility to have been\narch here. Even though it's not always been good times, in\ngeneral I've enjoyed it. Maybe I'll see you around again someday,\nsince I may be logging in once in a while from a friend's account.\nGood luck with the new Holy Mission!!\nFare well,\n\nUglymouth\n\n**\njug\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: Kannst Du mir mal sagen wo ich nen guten Parser finde?\n\nDate: Aug 16\n\nHi Herp!\n\nNa schon lange nichts mehr von mir gehort!\nIch bin jetzt von meiner Firma aus verbunden, um mal\nzu schauen ob es eigentlich funktioniert dass ich bei euch reinkomme.\nIch habe da mal ne Frage:\n- ich moechte zu probezwecken mal ein Mud auf meinem Linux-Rechner\n  installieren kannst Du mir mal sagen wo ich das\n  noetige Zeug herkriege?\n\nCiao danke Juergen.\n\n**\npace\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: demotion\n\nDate: Aug 22\n\nI'd like to be demoted to player level...
