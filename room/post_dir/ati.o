It will probably have a little different description.\nThings are kind of unstable here right now.\nAdd to the fact I do not know exactly what the claw did, I cannot make a copy of it.\nI have created a 2 handed weapon in my area, and its usable by mages.  \nI made most of mobs in my area 'hold' friendly.  Perhaps you should try it again sometime.\nJust watch out for the Shivan dragon.  He is not hold friendly.\nThe description of most of my non-hold-friendly mobs states that they are\nimmune to paralyzation magics.\n\nHope this helps,\nAnla'shok Na\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: ati\nSubj: claws\nDate: Mar  9\n\nGuess what I found lying around in whisky's directory?\nNow I just have understand it and get it to work.\nHe used stuff from Gambit's directory to make it work, and\nGambit no longer has any files here.\n\n\nAnla'shok Na\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: ati\nSubj: wolvie claws\nDate: Mar 10\n\nfixed.  no I just need a mob to put them on\nmake that NOW I just need  a mob to put them on\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: ati\nSubj: invisible\nDate: Mar 12\n\nwith the exception of the bosses of black, and the infernal spawn of evil, \nall mobs on my black level no longer see invisiblre\n\n**\n"
