I ran into her accidently on Lark. She dropped her baseball hat\nas she approached me and I picked it up. \n\nWe started talking about you. She said that you were her little carrot-head. She said that you had the\npersonality of a chair and the brains of a sheep. \n\nI tried to defend your honor, but then she grabbed my left testicle and said she loved me. I pretended that\nnothing had happened, but when she offered me a tortilla chips my resistance collapsed. I'm sure you'll\nunderstand. \n\nBy the way, can I borrow your Viper for my big date with your \"Ex\" this weekend?\n\nYour friend, \n\nJeremy\n\n\n**\ntuppence\n**\nTo: relgar\nSubj: ack!!!\n\nCc: baer peraphon flannel rosman\nDate: Nov 12\n\nyou told them!!! you promised you wouldnt!\nsee if i share any more of my chips with you!\nits not like i told peraphon about you and yer weekend with baer,bananas and tape!\nhrumph!\n\n**\nperaphon\n**\nTo: tuppence\n Re:   ack!!!\nCc: relgar baer flannel rosman\nDate: Nov 14\n\nYes you did!
