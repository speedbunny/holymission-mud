You seem to be not\nonly knowledgeable about code, but also able to convey that knowledge\nin written form.\n\nWould you be interested in preparing lessons which we could use to teach\npeople new to code how to do so effectively? Each week you could prepare\na lesson in any format you chose, through posts on your own board, lessons\nin a file, etc. \n\nNot only would these make for excellent doc files later on, we could\ndevelop a testing system which would work well for HM as you go. This \nwould also give you the ability to develop the instruction for the book\nyou were planning on writting. By limiting it to a lesson a week it will \nallow a constructive environment for teaching as many people as possible,\nespecially if you were willing to make yourself available to answer \nquestions during the week.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nAirborne\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: margusko\nSubj: Some things to note\n\nCc: sauron kryll\nDate: Feb  8\n\nWell the news has hit the fan. It is well known to the general people what\nsome of us have known all along. that you are Leslie. Now, I also hear that\nyou will be helping Airborne with the help files. That is definately needed\nhere.\n\nWell, just wanted to drop you a line and let you know that you are not\nin danger of being removed like you forced us to do Leslie. (If we had\nben really worried then margusko would have been gone a while back.)\nMost everyone deserves a second chance,just use it well. Last of all\nI know there are ALOT of holes in mud security that we have not plugged.\nAs I told you before I do not want to plug them unless there is no other\nchoice in the matter. I would like to trust wizards to know what is right.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: margusko\nSubj: Deadline.\n\nDate: Mar  1\n\nHey man.\n\nWhen I spoke to you a few weeks ago, we agreed that you had until the end\nof Februrary to demonstrate that the project you were working on would\ncome to fruition. Today is March 1st, and I see that nothing has changed.\nI stood up for you, and probably will again, but I must keep my word and\nso you have been demoted until you can demonstrate to me that you have\nsomething substantial to contribute to HM. You can email your proposal\nto me at airborne@wizvax.net.\n\nAirborne\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: margusko\n Re:   Deadline.\nDate: Mar  2\n\nI understand man, I am not holding it against you. But I did attach the \ndeadline, and so I have to stick to it. Since all you are doing is reading\nthe boards, being an Apprentice shouldn't get in the way.\n\nLet me know when you have time again, and we can work from there.\n\nAirborne\n\n**\n"
