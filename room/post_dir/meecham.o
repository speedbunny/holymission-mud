They are looking for a druid only room to act as a place to leave\nthings for others and maybe have the board moved there. At present, thieves\nfollow us around and take the things we leave for others at the room.\n\n2. The headband.....when you go linkdead you lose it but not the flameblade.\nAlso unlike the flameblade, when we drop the headband it is still there and\nanyone who picks it up gets a bunch of error messages.  I know the\nmage staff disappears when dropped.\n\nThanks\nSaffrin\n\n**\nemerald\n**\nTo: meecham\nSubj: ?\n\nDate: May 10\n\nHi.  I'm Wyderna on dragonstorm.  I have about 25 rooms left to do on my\narea there, but can't get into it.

I feel I have\ndone nothing to deserve this treatment. 80%+ of the items you\nlay the blame on me for I did not do and had no part of. This\ncontinual use of foul and abusive language is starting to wear\nthin. If you have nothing constructive to say, then please keep\nyour comments to yourself.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: meecham\nSubj: spell idea\nDate: Aug 25\n\nTake a look at this, and let me know what you think:\n\nstring cmd_delay_function,cmd_delay;\nint cmd_delay_time;\nobject cmd_delay_object;\nmixed *cmd_delay_args;\n\nint set_delayed_cmd(int time,object ob,string fun,mixed *args,string cmd) {\n  if(cmd_delay) {\n    printf(\"You are already busy preparing for the command '%s'.\\n\",\n           cmd_delay);\n    return 0;\n  }\n  else if(!time || !ob || !fun || fun==\"\") {\n    write(\"Invalid argument to set_delayed_cmd.\\n\");\n    return 0;\n  }\n  else if(!function_exists(fun,ob)) {\n    printf(\"Could not find the function '%s' in the target object '/%s'.\\n\",\n           fun,file_name(ob));\n    return 0;\n  }\n  else {\n    cmd_delay_time=time;\n    cmd_delay_object=ob;\n    cmd_delay_function=fun;\n    cmd_delay_args=args;\n    cmd_delay=cmd;\n    return 1;\n  }\n}\n\nint query_delayed_cmd() {\n  return cmd_delay?1:0;\n}\n\nstatic void clear_delayed_cmd() {\n  cmd_delay_time=0;\n  cmd_delay_object=(object)0;\n  cmd_delay_function=(string)0;\n  cmd_delay_args=({});\n  cmd_delay=(string)0;\n}\n\nstatic void exec_delayed_cmd() {\n  apply(#'call_other,cmd_delay_object,cmd_delay_function,cmd_delay_args);\n  clear_delayed_cmd();\n}\n\nvoid heart_beat() {\n  if(cmd_delay) {\n    if(!cmd_delay_time)\n      exec_delayed_cmd();\n    else\n      cmd_delay_time--;\n  }\n}\n\nThe only thing of note is the use of apply() in the exec stage... Not sure\nif you are aware of this, but that fun expands the last arg if it is a\nan array, and hence it perfect for uses like this.\n\nI talked to Mangla, and he said that kryll has something written into\na version of player.c and is just waiting to upload it, but he's said\nthat about several things recently, and it's getting to the stage where\nI get pissed off and code it anyway...\n\nAnyways, let me know what you think. Of course, this system will only\nwork if we get everyone to use it, and check for it in their cmds, but\nI can't worry abou that for now.\n\nSauron\n\n**\nfigleaf\n**\nTo: meecham\nSubj: Addy\nDate: Sep  1\n\nMark Wheeler\n3200 E.

I have a druid copy for you.  You can find it at\n/players/saffrin/misc/_legendlevels.txt\n\nit is hard to be a legend level druid without knowing how far \nwe are from the next level.\n\nThanks\nSaff\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: meecham\nRe:   help legendlevels\nDate: Nov  8\n\nWe havent yet and being a legend level druid gets tough when you\narent sure how far you have to go.  \n\nSaff\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: meecham\nSubj: potion shop\nDate: Nov  8\n\nHey the mages are asking for a potion shop.  What do you need for\nme to have one in there?\n\nSaff\n\n**\nsargon\n**\nTo: meecham\nRe:   query_immortal\nDate: Dec  1\n\nEasy enough to get there anyhow, just that i hate getting moved unexpectadly:)\n\n  Sargon\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: meecham\nSubj: guild room code changes (very minor)\nDate: Dec 11\n\nThere was a problem with disguised Thieves sneaking into your guild equip\nroom west of the main Druid guild room, so I recoded the guild check to stop\nthis. The new code is in /players/meecham/guild/room.c (the old, unchanged but\ncommented out, code is still in /players/meecham/guild/quip_room.c).\n\nLet me know if you have a problem with the changes I made. I allowed\nimmortals into the room since it helps us if a player asks us a question or\nwants to talk to us in the same room as them.\n\nSauron\n\n**\nredsexy\n**\nTo: meecham\nSubj: Hi hi hi\nDate: Jan  2\n\nWasn't meaning to ignore you I was just writing a mail!\n\nHappy new year, Meech...\n\nRed\n\n**\nexos\n**\nTo: meecham\nRe:   DS\nDate: Jan  2\n\nI might, but I just have little itme to be online anymore.\nI'll think about it.\n\n**\nkitty\n**\nTo: meecham\nSubj: hiya\nCc: kitty\nDate: Jan 12\n\nI see we are still married huh?
