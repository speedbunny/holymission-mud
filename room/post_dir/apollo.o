All old files have been backed up.\nAll commands can be found in /p/a/guild/bin\nOther than that the soul has been adjusted to the new structure.\nHope you can agree with the way I did it. Only the barbarian\ncombat commands are not bin'd, because they belong to another object.\nSee you around,\n\nViking Lord Uglymouth\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: apollo\nSubj: sewers\nDate: Feb 11\n\nI was wondering, if you are retired, if I could recode this area?\n\nSaffrin\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: apollo\nSubj: oops I meant the...\nDate: Feb 11\n\nlinkage area.\n\nSaffrin\n\n**\nmisticalla\n**\nTo: apollo\nRe:   hi\nDate: Jun 28\n\nHey there, I was just thinking about you as I logged in.\nI hope all is well with you and hope to hear from you soon.\n\nLove,\nShelley\n\nPS.

It is not meant\nas a promotion level. You may retain your current level as is without\nincurring any demotion for a while, but if you are inactive for more than\na year (ie not logging on at all) then you run the risj of removal during\nautomated purges.\n\nHope this puts your mind at rest.\n\nDave\n\n**\n"
