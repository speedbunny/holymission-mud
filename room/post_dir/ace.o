Except, I did have a date a few nights ago...there's a story I'll\ndefinitely have to save for a time when I can talk to you :).

Or don't you want to?\n\nYour crushed little wife,\nMe\n\n**\nroxanne\n**\nTo: ace\nSubj: Hey you :)\n\nDate: Apr 15\n\nI wanted to mail you here because I wasn't sure if your email address has changed or not....since you're moving and all that good stuff.  \nI've been going crazy (nothing new there).  I have 3 papers and a test this week so I'm stressing pretty severely right about now.  I just wanted to get in touch and say hi and all that god stuff.  Let me know how things are going with your job and life in general :).\n\nHopefully talk to you soon.\n\nLove,\n\tChrista\n\n**\nroxanne\n**\nTo: ace\nSubj: where have you been?\n\nDate: Apr 25\n\nI miss my hubby :(.\nCome back to me soon.\n\nWaitito kiss you all over ;) (in her sexy neglige)\n\nYour darling wife\n\n**\nroxanne\n**\nTo: ace\nSubj: HELP\n\nDate: May  4\n\nI desperately need your help if you can do it with your vase knowledge of computers.  .[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[Dt.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C\nI can't really explain everything that's wrong with it here, but I was wondering if you would mind if I called you and hopefully you can help me figure it out.  I haven't been able to get into my email for over a week and now I'm starting to have problems with more of my programs.  I don't know where I put your number *sorry*, but if you'd be willing to try to help me figure this out, I would love you forever. :)  ... and that way I can sing Happy Birthday to you in person :).  \n\n\tYou'll be my eternal hero....\n\nLoves and stuff,\n\n\tChrista\n\n**\nroxanne\n**\nTo: ace\nSubj: where the hell's my damn husband?\n\nDate: Jun  2\n\nYou're never around...I feel so neglected.\n You never take me out anymore...I never get any flowers.\nI think our marriage has gone stale.  I think we need to rev up our sex life...maybe that'll do the trick.  ;)\n\nAre you EVER here anymore?   \n\nPining for you....\n\n\tMe  :)\n\n**\nroxanne\n**\nTo: ace\nSubj: Hello love...\n\nDate: Jun 23\n\n\nI thought I would write you here since I rarely get mail on this game...and I like coming on to see that I \nhave NEW mail :).  Anyway...I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed talking \nto you a few days ago.  It's good to hear your voice every once in a while.  \n\nI have been totally miserable all weekend.  Major head pain so I've been popping Advil\nlike candy *yummy*.  It's getting a little better, but it's just no fun, you know?\nI got that job at Network Video...did I te about that?  Well, I'm working at a \nvideo store now and believe it or not it's paying me $.70 more an hour.  I'll be able to work full time, it's about 2 minutes away from my house and I won't have to deal with rush hour any more.  Pretty good deal, eh?\n\nOh, I went to check out my apartment again on Friday to show my friend Denise before we\nwent out that night...and I was thoroughly disgusted to find that there were ROACHES\neverywhere...eeewwwwww.  One thing I can not handle is creepy crawly things.  ICK.  So\nI'm going to have a little talk with the landlord and see what's going on there.  \n\nI have to get going now, dear.  I'll talk to you soon and send you some email...hopefully\nwe'll catch each other on here someday.  \n\nTake care.\n\nLove,\nChrista\n\n**\nroxanne\n**\nTo: ace\nSubj: hi love\n\nDate: Aug  1\n\ni miss my hubby....it's getting cold and lonely between my sheets :)   *who said that?*\n\n\n*smooch*\n\nme\n\n**\nroxanne\n**\nTo: ace\nSubj: Where's my hubby?\nDate: May  7\n\nI guess you don't stay whenever you're here so there's slight chance of meeting you here :(.  I feel bad that I forgot your birthday...I know you hinted and I forgot...no dumb excuses....I'm sorry.  But since you forgot mine too we'll just have to make it up to each other.  ;)\n\n\nOK...talk to you soon :)\n\nLove, your adoring wife....\nMe\n\n**\n"
