I wanted to make this request of all \nof you.  I am sorry if i could not included everyone as I brought up\nmost of your names from memory.\n      I was removed banished because Herp was told on the wizline \nby Leslie that It was me who had altered his prison file.\nLeslie said this because i was mentioning the abuse of the\nprison file earlier that day.  I have made almost no attempt\nto reinstate my self in the last few months but I am coming\nto the point where I really miss being here and talking with most\nof you.  When I was here I made a difference.  I want to do so again\nMy life has settled down and I am no longer in transition.  I hold\nthe postion of General Manager and Partner of Hawk Manufactured Housing\nbased in Warren PA and have recently opened the 5th Sanchin Karate Academy \nthere.  But anyway.\nI have sent mail to Herp explaning everything that transpired and trying\nto clear up the whole mess.  I need support.\nI would like to ask each and every one of you to mail a short message\nto Herp.  Say what you can.  If only that you believe what happened \nwas a mistake and you would like to see Tatsuo unbanished.\nI am counting on each one of you.  I hthink I have helped each one \nof you over the years and I REALLY WANT TO COME BACK.\nplease drop me a mail if you sent something so i can keep track.\nThank You,\n         David Grant Goodman, AKA Tatsuo\n           814-226-7228\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: haplo\nSubj: ezo\n\nCc: sauron,mangla,silas, trout, akira, unuscione,jewel\nDate: Jul 29\n\n\nREquesting write access to patience directory.\nObjective: TO recode ezo and oriental areas of mud.\nArea to include: Ezo, Ishikawa, Iheya-Shima, unuscione's island,\n                 possible areas from akira and trout.\nGuilds involved: Ninja, Samurai(to be recoded), Wu-Jen (to be proposed)\n                  and Psionisist (trout/akira)\n\nPeople: Tatsuo, Akira, Haplo, Trout, Unuscione, and other wiz with\n        these interests in mind.\n\nRequirements:  I will  need general access to several directories\n               and at least Lord status returned.  These wizards\n               have worked as a team for over a year, some longer\n               than that (peers at haplo).  Team coding is the\n\t        best possible way i can see to accomplish long\n\t        term projects without usual procrastination.\n\t        The synergy between elements allows leverage \n\t        for each element to accomplish his own goals.\n\nIMHO: Beelzebub is not fit for the position handed to him, it is\npossible to restore the old ninja guild if we find ONE file.\nThat file is nskills.h (NOT THE VERSION IN DICE DIRECTORY)\nGive me some time i will find out if I can buy the disk from Gambit, \nor, request herp check for backups of HM from 1993\n\nThank you gentlemen for your consideration. \nThe longer you ponder, the longer it takes us to complete.\n\nTatsuo\n\n**\nsmurf\n**\nTo: thorm\nSubj: SCHOOL IS IN!!!\n\nCc: demolian,marco,cara,hootie,kutya,docreason,tsubaki,sipher,gorlin,wa, joyful, dreamer,exos,unuscione\nDate: Aug 26\n\nHI GUYS AND GIRLS!!!!\nI am finally back to school and boy have i missed you all!!!\nMy e mail address hasn't changed....so MAIL ME!!\nS_mlkilgore@vaxa.clarion.edu\nTalk to you all soon!!!!!\n\nLove and miss you all!!!\nSmurf\n(Michelle)\n\n**\njewel\n**\nTo: unuscione\nSubj: heya\n\nDate: Sep  1\n\nI saw that you were on today!\n\nYou didn't reply to my mail! :(\n\nAre you mad at me?\n\nHow was your summer?
