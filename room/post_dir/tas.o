Also if we have a problem with a pker etc you can't legally bring\non more than one person so it would be useless to have more than one char in.\n\nRelgar. :)\n\n**\nperaphon\n**\nTo: relgar\nSubj: New member\n\nCc: tuppence figleaf kryten izekiel tetsuhara manfred tas quazar tinkerbell\nDate: Aug  9\n\nI have the pleasure of announcing a new member, inducted a \ncouple of days ago by yours truly.\n\nThe member is....
