You appear to have gone net dead.\n     -Alagahd\n(A shout will do if I'm on)\n\n**\nsargon\n**\nTo: semalena\nSubj: Hi\n\nDate: Apr  5\n\nSo how often are you on here?\nStop by sometime.\nMike\n\n**\nsargon\n**\nTo: semalena\nSubj: Hi barb\n\nDate: Apr 23\n\nMost of the time i'm invis but if you shout or ask a wiz or higher they can give me the message.  Good to hear from you and sorry i missed you.\nMike\n\n**\nsargon\n**\nTo: semalena\nSubj: Hi Barb\nDate: Oct 15\n\nI don't know about the shout-curse thing, i'll look into it.\nAs for tells?  That should work, maybe some wiz screwed up.\nWe have a chat line now, just use chat.  If any wiz or higher is no\nthey should be able to tell me you are here.  I try not to be invis\ntoo often but when coding its alot easier as you know.\nI'd really like to run into you, been on realms several \ntimes and just miss you.\nThanks for the notes and stopping in.\nMaybe one of these times we'll hook up, we'll just have to keep\ntrying.\nMike\n\n**\n"
