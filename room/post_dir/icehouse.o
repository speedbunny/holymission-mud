I have given some thought to the question\nyou put to me at our last discussion. Through much research and inquiry\nof some of the worlds top scientists it has become clear to me that the\nanswer to your question is in the negative. I'm sorry...\nAsper Cream is not a ratio.\n\nBest Regards,\nRelgar\n\n**\nbaer\n**\nTo: relgar\nSubj: viagra\nCc: tuppence, widge, peraphon, icehouse, rossi, neimad, fuzzy, linsolent, jimpa, waldo, beelzebub, beezlebub, boadicia, whoever, else, why, isnt, there, anyone, logged, in, here?\nDate: Mar  8\n\nhey want to know what makes you feel younger than viagra?\njust get your player file wiped and it wipes hundreds of days off your age.\ni havent felt this young since rossi and i pk'ed each other to nothing.\nalthough it does suck not having any alieses or nicknames or guild or money.\nbut i do feel younger ..\nor did i already mention that?\ni must be getting old\n\n**\nicehouse\n**\nTo: widge\nSubj: whats wrong?\nCc: icehouse\nDate: Mar 17\n\nI'd like to know what your problem is with me.\nEver since I organised that nice weekend away for us, and later visited you in Sydney, and rang you after I got back, you seem to be not interested in me.\nYou havent called me at all, you send me short sharp emails or that one mud mail, either not signing it at all, or if I'm lucky, a 'luv' at the end.\nI make a special effort to come see you today on here and you just say how you want a divorce so you can talk to people, yet you have nothing to say to me.\nThen you just announce you are leaving, hug the other guy, not me and without a goodbye, or letting me know when you are coming back, you are gone.\nI wait here for 4 hours and you didn't come back. What a waste of time.\nYour plan says you want to sort your life out. I am getting a strong impression it is to be a life without me. Life is pretty hard for me without you being here and you don't seem to be making the effort your promised you would since moving back.\nI try to be positive and helpful as much as I can, and I get nothing back. For someone like you who spends so much time on the net and loves writing letters so much I thought I would get a few more and better emails. And for someone who talks to people from overseas on the phone, I expected more than half a dozen phone calls a year to her BOYFRIEND\nI've been trying to organise how we can see each other over easter the last few days. Don't know why, I bet you havent done anything about it. Even when your mum offered to drive you to Orange to see me at the James Morison concert, you weren't interested! I suppose you had better things to do than show any interest in me.\nWell get a mud divorce if thats what you want. You don't want to talk to me and thats a fine excuse not to.\nWhy do I bother?\nAnd what do you care anyway.\n\nIf you want things to be better you can just make more of an effort this time, because I get the strongest messages from you that I am merely a friend and not much else.\n\n**\nredsexy\n**\nTo: icehouse\nSubj: Quest\nDate: Mar 17\n\nHi,\n\nYou'll find that this is actually a mudlib bug -- it is the same if\nyou go linkdead when writing a message to the boards - it will\nsay there is someone already writing a note.\n\nShame I wasn't online because it is one of the most regular complaints\nfrom people who use the boards and I know what to do about it.\n\nReally sorry.  Not a fault in my code though.\n\nRedsexy\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: icehouse\nFwd:  Archood\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Archood\nCc: akira, uruz, waldo, redsexy, bobo, wilbie, tinman, sargon, tatsuo, shadowmonk, nae\nDate: Mar 22\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a final effort at swaying you towards seeing a reasonable course of action\nfor Holy Mission, a great game that is not fun with the people that are running it\nthe way it is and has been run.  I have layed out many reasons why i want to be arch\nand i am consistantly put off and ignored.  The arches want to do everything behind \nclosed doors.  I am sending this letter to Mangla, who of all the arches, is the\nonly one that codes, and has been here, and who has admittedly pointed out that\nhe forgets things, and misses things, because of everything that needs done.\n\nCoding for HM is something that I enjoy to the fullest, but it has not been fun.\nAt every turn I have an archwizard speaking down at me, lying about me or at\nleast continuing an untrue rumor to others, THIS IS LOGGED, I have sent it to \nmangla.  We have archwizards who last coded 5 years ago.  We have archwizards\nwith outside commitments that take up space here.  We have archwizards that\ntake off 5 months and turn up like messiahs reasserting their rightful positions\nand casting down judgements. And we have one coding arch.\n\nFor 3 and one half years I watched the mud go through death throws, as players\nand wizards were driven off by shitty policies, guild closings, and the mud\nbeing moved around( all reasons I have heard).  Sauron, of the beloved\nninja guild had 3.5 years to recode ninja, he also had 3.5 years to\nput the monk into a bin system, and do something to balance it.  It just wasn't\ndone.  I do not know what he has done, but i can only speak of what wasn't done,\nand ask if opening and fixing these guilds was less important that what was done.\n\nThere was plenty of time for these people to \"shit or get off the pot\".\nIt wasn't done.  For those of you who do not know, or who have prescribed to\nthe rumors that abound.  I was banned by mistake.  I was kept away and put\noff without reason.  Untrustworty was heard. All sorts of things.\nFor the brief time i was unbanned, i was NEVER returned to my position,\nalthough it was a mistake that i lost it.  I was kept and treated as\na wiz with suspicion, and comments being made about me.  It sucked.\n\nI was restored to my position.  Airborne said it was a check on Mangla.\nMangla said it was to bring back HM.  Silas voted for me cause i asked him.\nIn the time that i made elder, I restored the ninja with wilbie, tinman,\nand bobo, restored the summoners with redsexy.  recruited and set up\n7 new Gm's, reviewed and opened 5 areas, coded a clan system, and fixed\n2 whole areas.  There is much more that needs done.  And i log on every\nday to find some social archwizard speaking down from above.  Or active\nones talking down about me or to me.  Telling me what is wrong with me, \nand refusing to listen to all the facts established about what is wrong\nwith what they have done.  I have done archwizard work.  I was an archwizard.\nI have used elder position to help everyone on here, even the assholes.\n\nMany other wizards have been inspired to come back, but that momentum is dying.\nThey have been put off, forgotten, while the ALL important archwizards\nsit back for a month to discuss things.  Redsexy was ignored for a year.\nHer area forgotten.  Bobo has done more coding than any other person\nat his rank, he is ignored and put off.  I don't blame him for cutting back.\nThere are wizards that are banished and wanted to come back, but they are\nignored.  And Exos is still here even after the testimony of 7 or 8 people\nattested to his absolute wrongdoings.\n\nAfter the ninja guild was restored, players and wizards started calling for\nnew archwizards with my name being mentioned many times.  These people were\ntold point blank to shut the hell up.  I have no conception of what\nyou arches have going on in that little room, and what bullshit ideas are\nfloating around.  But face it. One coding arch, isn't going to cut it.\nThe mud blew up in sargons workroom, understandings were reached, Then ignored.\nThat Tuesday came and went a month ago.  The old ways are no longer needed.\nWho is gonna help you put in the 100 level system? Airborne? Silas?\nKryll?, maybe Warlord and Uglymoth.  Maybe Sauron when he comes back from\nhis next extended vacation.  Hello, Tatsuo has the ability, and has shown it.\nThe mantras of me being some evil son of a bitch won't work forever when\nthey are demonstrably untrue.  You know what Redsexy is right, I am BOTH.\n\nI cannot fathom the resistance to the move when everything points to a positive.\nWhen there is a chance to remove the dead weight and move up the people\nthat are bringing back the players.  The momentum as you put it is starting to slip\nwith the players.  I can spark it back up.  I will claim responsibility\nfor a large percent of the comeback that is started.  I give the rest to the\npeople who have been ignored and put off.  From what i know, there are\npotentially 3 mudlib level coders on the game besides you Mangla.\nThose are your archwizards.\nTatsuo, Wilbie, and Sargon.\n\nPlease stop bogarting the highest position in the game when others can fill \nthose positions.  calling kryll to login hasn't made him come back and fix the\nplace. and saurons instant appearance also has done little but piss me off.\nPut the level where the level belongs.  With the people that code this place,\nand enjoy it.\n\nYou want the 100 level system in, arch those people.\nYou want the guilds running and balanced, arch those people.\nYou want players coming back, arch those people.\nYou want new players, arch those people.\nYou want wizards coding and being helped with code, arch those people.\nYou want Holy Mission back, arch those people.\n\nIf you want things the way they were. Sit back and dicuss things some more with\nthe deadbeats that brought her down.\nMake some changes, shake the boat. Take action, make it fun.\nIf not, I am outta here.  \n\nI have forwarded this to every wiz that gives a damn, and i will ask that\nthese wizzes write their feelings to MANGLA and cc it to TATSUO.  I want\na clean and open debate.  I also ask that it not be sent to other arches\nwhose feelings may be hurt by it.  That is not my intention.  I i have\nspoken an untruth, let it be known.  If i am right, tell mangla to fix the\nplace.\n\nTatsuo, for Holy Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: redsexy\nFwd:  Tatsuo / Archwiz\nCc: sargon, akira, uruz, waldo, wilbie, bobo, tinman, widge, icehouse, ati\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo / Archwiz\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nWell I'm only a beginner, and actually this is the 1st MUD i've ever been on. And I may not know much about what all the details are, but I can say that Tatsuo is someone on here who I could immediately tell that he knew what he was doing.\nWhen there was a bug, Tatsuo fixes it. When we bump into each other, he converses with me. I constantly see him on here and he has never EVER said anything like \"Well hold on. I'm busy.\"\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding. But once I met people like Tatsuo and Redsexy who were this friendly, I haven't even tried one of the other 500 muds on this list of mine. That should show how attractive this place is. And if all the other Archwizzes made it what it is today, I'm sure those two can help make it what it will be tomorrow.\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding.
