Anyway, I have a shitload of work to do, but I wanted to say hi :).  I've missed talking to you.  Hopefully we can get together soon.  Let me know what you've been up to.  I know you've been busy....\n\nLater!\n\nLove,\n\tChrista\n\n**\nslick\n**\nTo: septian\nSubj: e-mail\n\nCc: **\nDate: Apr 28\n\nhey dude been trying to get up with u to give u my e-mail address well here it is. kingmick@hotmail.com please send the requested info there. thanks mick :) ps write me!! let me know whats up w/you ok? :) **\n\n**\nkryll\n**\nTo: septian\nSubj: room chats\n\nCc: emerald\nDate: May  9\n\nwell, my job got into the way of coding it, but i promise i \nwill get to it this weekend so that monday you can look\nat it...i do apologize, but my job cannot be helped as i do\nneed money\n\ntake care and have a good weekend\n\nkryll\n\n**\nkryll\n**\nTo: septian\nSubj: room noises\n\nCc: emerald\nDate: May 14\n\nok, i have finally got my test rooms online and tested.\njust take a look at bulp.c, test1.c, test2.c, test3.c, test4.c\nthe bulp.c is the main room which contain all the functions \nto provide the noises to the rooms that need it and the\n4 test rooms are sample rooms on how to make it work.\n\nif you have any questions, just ask.\n\nKryll\n\n**\nkryll\n**\nTo: torpapa\nSubj: multiple characters\n\nCc: sylvan, septian, figleaf, saffrin, haplo, kryll\nDate: Jun 25\n\nIf you are caught one more time playing multiple characters\nsimultaneously then the higher level one will be removed.\nYou have been warned enough, and cheating will not be\nallowed.
