I sent you a postcard,so don't say I never gave ya nothing!  I got the new issue of Cosmo while I was waiting there (about 4 hours), and the trip over the big panna wudder was rough as well.  about half way through the flight I got up to take out my contacts, and while I was waiting for a free bathroom, I got soooooo dizzy I thought I was going to pass out and die.  The stweradrdess was like \"are youalright?\"and handed me a barf bag of my very own, which I then discreetly used.  Yuck.  I feel like such a wimp.  I felt alot better after it though.  I think tortellini in thick cheese sauce, while good, was not the best thing for a bmpy flight.  The guy next to me was really nice, but he was drinking like a fish during the whole flight, and I just don't see how he managed not to puke.  He sais he travels alot, though, so I guess that's it.\nI think I'm going to start talking with a Dutch accent pretty soon.  It's reallly weird.  When I hear words in my head now, they sound kind of Elmer Fudd-ish (I weally wouldn't wanna huwrt hwim)  hehe. Today we wer supposed to go the the VanGogh Museum, but it started pouring, so we'll prolly go tomorrow.  He's nice, and his cat is goodly as well.  She looks exactly like jimpa, the face shape and body structure, except she's white and all slutty.  yum yum.\nSandra (the cat) gives Malo a run for his money.  I gotta check and see if she stretches later...hehe\nI tried getting to realms, but the mud was down, my character deleted, and when it came back up, I couldn't find the post office.\nSo tell Mom and Dad that things are going well here--I'm recovering from jet-lag (I was sooooo dead when I got here) and I'll be travelling to paris next Monday.  Maybe I can find a cyber-bar there or something, at any rate, I'll send out some tulip postcards tomorrow :)\nHow are you? and how is little Schpaaa-birdie?\nMy poorlittle abandoned kitten...\n*sigh*\nI miss you, so write me some big long letter.\nLove,\nMary\n\n**\nmikey\n**\nTo: jimpa\nSubj: hiya\nDate: Sep 17\n\nHiya Jimpa!\n\nI'm still alive!!!
