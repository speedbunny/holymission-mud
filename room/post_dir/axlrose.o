Stay, just for a few minutes, then we can all go together\"\n\n\n**\naxlrose\n**\nTo: saffrin\nSubj: ...\n\nCc: axlrose\nDate: Aug 13\n\nIn simplest sense - I've had enough.\n\nThis back and forth - one day you're talking to me, the next day you aren't,\nhas aggrevated me.  I am tired of practically having to get anything out of\nyou.  All last week you did not say a damn thing.  Two weekends ago there \nwas NO sign of you - maybe you were on Patterns the whole time.  Came to \nRealms to answer my rant and then left.  Finals I figured out, but did you\nsay anything to me beforehand, or even during?  Not a damn thing... call me\nSaturday, nice as it was, but nothing, no plans, couldn't even answer my\nquestion about us in the future.  Saturday night, all day Sunday - nothing\nuntil you came on Sunday night drunk and yelled at me about something.  Then\nyou were trying to be nice - back and forth.  Come Monday - nothing at all -\nmaybe you were out looking for work, maybe you were out with the couple guys\nyou said were with you Saturday night..... so I logon here and idle, but do\nyou notice me?  Nope, sitting there talking away with Figleaf, Nae, Silas and\n~then~ you finally noticed me.  Me, the so-called important person in your\nlife gets pushed aside again.\n\nTonight, you logon and go straight to Silas it seems.  Give me some tells - I\nguess I am not good enough to have your prescence eh?  Ran off with him too \nit seems, but so what at this point.  Should I go on?  The little shit - like\nhow you can run around marrying this person and that on muds galor, but on\nRealms, do we get married?  You're never around long enough to even ask.  You\ndon't want people to know here so that's why you stay married.  The coming to\nRealms the one night to ask if you can marry off your test character was clas-\nsic!  You couldn't even stay around there long enough to talk to me.  Me!  The\nlove of your life and all - no, push me aside.  I'll be around when ~you~ feel\nlike it.  And sex - bah!  I have to beg and grovel dozens of times before you\ndecide you're up for it.  Or tell me about what you did on your own but not\ninclude me...\n\nSo you want to know why I feel I don't need to talk to you anymore?  Because\nI am tired of playing second fiddle with you damnit!\n  - me...\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: axlrose\nSubj: the file\nDate: Aug 26\n\nI am making it detailed, my netcom kept crahsing, there are a few more names I need\nto get for you.\n\nCindi\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: axlrose\nSubj: thak you\nDate: Sep 16\n\nThank you for defending me, you did help\n\n**\naxlrose\n**\nTo: saffrin\nSubj: *shrug*\nCc: axlrose\nDate: Sep 17\n\nI tried to be friendly, but nope, you do not want it.  No matter what I do, it\nis not good enough, that everything I say is against you.  I'm telling you this\nCindi, you bitch to me how I twist and turn things around yet you do not ever\nsee what you do.  And you have done it, don't play the innocent again.  Come on\nnow, how many times have I heard you over the phone complain about people like\nFigleaf and Kryll, yet come here to the mud and everything is fine and dandy.\nIt then makes me wonder what you say about me behind my back.  I told you after\nour arguement that I will try to be the friend I was, but you put up barriers\non everything.  I tried and tried and after so many times of feeling like you \ndo not want to talk to me, I mention it to you in a last hope and what do you\nthen tell me?  \"Fuck you\" - geesh, to use your words, \"you have shown me a lot\nwith those words...\"\n\nI've tried to be nice, but this is not worth it.  If one line of mine can bring\nabout total hatred towards me, fine, I'll accept it.  But if you're so thin-\nskinned to not accept any apologizes, any attempts to make amends, then I don't\nwant to be a part of you carrying around guilt.\n  - Peter...\n\n**\ndaniella\n**\nTo: axlrose\nSubj: talk\nDate: Oct 31\n\nhey, whats up?  you said you kinda wanted to talk to me...\ni havent been on lately, and havent seen you\nwanna mail me about it?\ni have had so much shit to do, exam tomorrow, paper next thursday\ntons of cleaning to do, etc etc etc\nmail me if you want to\ndanielle\n\n**\ndaniella\n**\nTo: axlrose\nRe:   More talking...\nDate: Nov  1\n\nhmmmm, why will your brother always remember that night...\n\ndani\n\n**\nredsexy\n**\nTo: axlrose\nRe:   E-mail addy...\nDate: Nov  2\n\nsaah@peerless-stampings.co.uk\nmake that\nsarah@peerless-stampings.co.uk\n\nThat will change pretty soon.. \n\nSarah\n\n**\ndaniella\n**\nTo: axlrose\nRe:   *ponder*\nDate: Nov  2\n\nalright?\nnot really, no...\nbut one must press on\ndo you know where he is?\ndani\n\n**\namethyst\n**\nTo: axlrose\nRe:   Hiya!\nDate: Nov 25\n\nboo.. .how are you?\n\n**\namethyst\n**\nTo: axlrose\nRe:   *smile*\nDate: Nov 28\n\nWe';Well i'll missy a\nYA fun to talk to\nAmethyst hugs you =)\nSo what have youb een doing with yourself?\nI amvisitng my boyfriend right now.. so i gotta go\nTTFN\n\n**\n"
