After a hectic week,\nclass is slowing down again - COBOL doesn't seem to be a difficult\nlanguage to understand... just very wordy. It's as boring as I expected\nit to be. ;) How long do you think it will be before you need some of the\nstuff you sent over? I wish I could get my hands on a CD burner - even after\ncompressing my dos partition I don't have all that much HD space to spare.\nOh for a job (and hence some money)!\n\nAnything exciting happened on the mud while I've been absent? The boards\nseem as quiet as ever. I'm still working on quite a few things, and I\nstill haven't heard anything from James - I'll try writing to him again\nthis weekend and see if I get a responce. Just getting my hands on whatever\nhe's done up til now would be good.\n\nI've got to get going for now - got to get ready for class - but I hope to\nbe around more this weekend so we should bump into each other at some point.\nThanx again for the stuff - I can see that I've got alot of reading ahead\nof me!\n\nDave\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: access to ninja\nCc: warlord,sauron\nDate: Jun 30\n\nCould I get access to Patience's directory (at least the ones for ninja).\nI am testing out some ninja weapons and need to inherit some of the files.\n\nTanx.\n\n**\nsypher\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: playerkilling\nDate: Jul  6\n\nmangla-\ntop 3 reasons for killing fritz:\n1) he stole from me,\n2) he snared, mudballed, and attacked me,\n3) he repeatedly did the same to alexg... a newbie and a friend of mine.\n\nwhile killing him for alexg is not a valid reason, his stealing\nand attacking me is (at least in my mind)....\nI know playerkilling is illegal now, but i think that the old rules of pk-ing\nshould apply.\n\nif I am mistaken, please let me know.\n\n   sypher\n\n**\nquilt\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: thieves\nCc: blade,brainsprain,septian\nDate: Jul 30\n\nok i basically am gonna compare thieves and monks (cos you guys already wiped out the other guilds)\nmonks can hide in dark - why?\nmonks have death blows..fine..they can use them as many times as they want..thieves only get one backstab\ndeath blow does 2/3 damage of backstab i suppose\nmonks have HEAPS of other combat abilities\nadmittedly..some of those abilities are shit..but when you consider that we only have one\ndoesn't seem to make sense\n\nnow i'm not trying to take down monks...(although they are overpowered) but thieves are now too underpowered without ambush or throw..\nnow they were buggy (or so blade told me)..fair enough..but surely we can get something to complement backstab\n\nand i think also that most of the thief abilities are pk orientated..because to put it simply they are relevant to most npcs who a)have more hp and b)are not effected by mudballs and stuff\n\nanyway..i had a few suggestions in the past..i'll mail them to you if you like..\n\nP.S. we don't want to powerup backstab..just want some combat options\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Sheankala\nDate: Jul 31\n\nSheankala has a death shout that contains the name and guild of the player\nwho kills her.

Look in /p/a/psi/bin and\nlook at nosebreak and summon and rage. Summon rage will take\nthe place of barbarian combat once I or you get it to work\nand nosebreak will be a high level hold.

I think that we should \ndo whatever we can to me the mud more challenging for players, and \nthat the abundance of healing definately has something to do with \nthat. 40-60 gold per HP for a carried is not unreasonable, however\nwe need to look at how that balances with guild regenerative abilities\nas well.  Once we limit the availability of portable healing, suddenly\nany guild that offers healing is considerably more potent.  I think if \nwe do things like this that we should perhaps balance meditation skills\nwith something like 'can only meditate in a temple'... with that being \njust one example.\n\nW.\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: airborne\nRe:   healing\nCc: arches\nDate: Oct 31\n\nI don't know that we should remove all meditation outside of a 'temple' but\nmaybe we could reduce the healing rate outside of that player's guild rooms.\nSeems to me that being in their temple, or at their shrine, or whatever,\nshould heal them faster, or conversely, being away from there should heal\nthem slower (since we want to reduce the healing, not increase it).\n\nDave\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: mangla\nFwd:  healing\nCc: arches\nDate: Nov  1\n\nTo: airborne\nRe:   healing\nCc: arches\nDate: Oct 31\n\nI don't know that we should remove all meditation outside of a 'temple' but\nmaybe we could reduce the healing rate outside of that player's guild rooms.\nSeems to me that being in their temple, or at their shrine, or whatever,\nshould heal them faster, or conversely, being away from there should heal\nthem slower (since we want to reduce the healing, not increase it).\n\nDave\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: healing...\nCc: arches\nDate: Nov  1\n\nSorry about that, zigged when I should have zagged.\n\nHere's the idea that I have been bouncing about in my head.  \n\nOk, suppose we limit meditation/healing skills to only the guild room\nand \"shrines\".  Then we give guild members the ability to create \nshrines in various locations.  Players will be able to have their \nhealing, but they would have to work a bit for it.  \n\nTo start, we'd have the shrine needed to be built.  An easy way to\nget players to spend a bunch of gold on all sorts of things, bowls, \nstatues, insense, etc.  Then they would have to protect those locations\nonce they were built.  Certainly leaving lots of valuables laying \naround would tempt almost any player, which would kinda be the point.\nAdd in the idea that some elements of theshrine would degrade with\ntime (insence comes to mind) and have to be replaced every so \noften.  \n\nThe idea is to create an economy by finding reasons for players to gather\nor purchase things that aren't just for killing.  If insence were only\navailable in a small handful of locations, and there was a demand for it\nwe'd create the demand.  It helps control healing rates, keeps money\ndown a bit, adds a roleplaying element to the mud, and encourages guilds\nto work together.\n\nIdeas and critics?\n\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: reopen ezo and ishikawa\nCc: wilbie, airborne\nDate: Nov  3\n\n\nWilbie and I would like to reopen at least the areas of ezo and ishikawa, the area\ncoded by patience, that i recoded, and the area, haplo and I, (secret: I coded whole \nthing),  coded with the ishikawa quest.\n\npriorities for project.\n\n1. Get Ezo reopened save for the ninja guild halls, upgrade monsters, and equipment\n  to current standards.\n\n2. Reopen Ishikawa, reinstate quest, recode as necessary.\n\n3. Reopen Ninja guild, I believe i have the talent and experience necessary after\n   completion of first two steps to get it working.  Wilbie as well.\n\n4.  Recode and reopen of samurai guild. \n\n\nThese eastern areas were a HUGE attraction in during the old days, and wilbie and\nmyself remember enough of it, having been part, and coding extensivly with these areas.\n\nPlease approve the project, and give instructions for implementation of each part.\n\nTatsuo & Wilbie\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: Ezo etc\nCc: mangla\nDate: Nov  3\n\nAs far as I know, Ezo is completely open and complete.  Warlord has the ninja\nguild coming slowly but surely.  I have been doing some weapons for my \nFuzhou area that are ninja compatable (was working with Darastor on that).\nBecause we are implementing SAP here at work, I haven't done much but we're\nnow done implementing, so I will be coding a lot more now.\n\nAs far as Samurai/Ishikawa go, I will help out with whatever.  Actually, you\ncan put Fuzhou in Ishikawa.  It's a small fishing village.\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: more stuff, with some facts this time\nDate: Feb  4\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Ideas and proposals for Holy Mission, Displayed in Non marketed format.\n\n\n1.  Allow force command for Sage or Lord levels to assist players without\n    having to dictate every action necessary.\n    \n    Example.  Player bob has problem with spell not working, upon\n    snooping Eldr wiz believes it to be alias problem instead of asking\n    player to type alias, or nickname, the force command would save time\n    and bickering from spammy players!  Also allows forced saves, etc.\n   \n    Fact.  Every other mud i have experienced allows this at midlevels\n\n2.  Wizlist,  I believe the list_wiz function is still in the master object.\n    I have all these print outs from the period in which i was an archwizard.\n    The sad part is that i actually kept them in a box.  This could be\n    interesting command for wizards to see who else is a wizard and I \n    never understood why it was reserved for the wiz levels,  if there\n    is a reason, enlighten me.\n\n3.  Can we officially appoint GM's, and ask around or post for GM's to \n    take over for inactives.  Even inexperienced ones would be beneficial\n    as there are some coders around to assist them now.  Some names come\n    to mind.  Waldo, Wilbie, Bobo.\n\n4.  I would like to place an idea board in the elevator room just west\n    of church.  I would also like to place a sign in the description of\n    the church that when read reveals the location, directions to, description\n    of the various newbie areas, as well as indicating the newbie should\n    explore the knowledge in 'help newbie'  The idea board would specifically\n    address ideas to be added, changed, deleted from the game from players.\n    Wizards willing to take up the challenge could post their interest in\n    coding the idea in response.  Once ideas get posted, then other players\n    usually draw on the idea, and when players log in and see that ideas\n    are actually being taken care of quickly, they may want to try them, and\n    may stick around more than the average 2 minute login to check mail, and\n    say HI.\n\n5.  Would like endorsement of the clan system, so i can standardize and establish\n    creation rules,  It is VERY popular, there are now 4 clans role playing\n    different groups.  Each is sponsered by [WIZ] or higher.  The code\n    is available to any who want it as are all my files.\n\n    Tatsuo - Wing Cong -  Oriental Assassins and spies\n    Waldo- Lycanthropes - Psuedo shape changers (titles and short desc only)\n    Bobo-  Heiliolites - Fanatically pagan sun worshipers!\n    Wilbie - Inquisitors - MORE fanatics!  Group of evil wannabes.\n    Several other wizards including Sargon have voiced interest in starting\n    a clan.\n\n    Clans have NO benefit to the players attributes,  only neat emotes, chat line,\n    title sets, a pose, and common areas hidden in the mud, perhaps with a board.\n    This unites players, and rivalries are friendly.  The Clanmaster must make\n    it clear that Pking in the name of the clan is forbidden because of the\n    last great 'Clan war'.  \n\n    The guilds provide abilites for players, the Clan provides the personality \n    of the character.  Hopefully more wizards will have better ideas.\n\n6.  Bobo has done an excellent job in redesigning Kellie's area, this area\n    is ready for final inspect and installation.  It is very near your\n    area and you would be more familiar with it than I.  It is 99% bug free, as\n    I might have missed something.\n\n7.  In case you are wondering why this not is so damn long, I am doing it on notepad\n    on a stupid 386, at work.  It is 4am and I am training this dumbass kid\n    how to audit.  He is pretty much doing it on his own, So i am a babysitter for\n    the rest of the week.  So I decided to bother our esteemed arch staff.\n\n8.  From what i can tell, the summoner code has been deemed inefficient \n    because each creature is using call_outs and hearbeats every tick of its\n    existance.  This does not seem to be a problem as I checked the active\n    heartbeats on the mud for the last several days, and found that a consistant\n    15 to 20 obj/monsters are active at any time.  There will never be more\n    than 2 or 3 summoners on at any time, thus increasing this number by\n    6 to 9 hbs.   It looks a hell of alot more efficient than that damn \n    mage guild shadow that has been around since llort first threw it together.\n    Did you know every mage staff carrys a heartbeat to restore the hp/sp of\n    the player?\n\n    I am trying to get some facts for the reinstallation of summoner guild.\n    Again, correct me if I am wrong.  Also as much as you correct me for\n    speaking for Wilbie,  I know for a fact he would like running the \n    Summoner guild.  I wish Matt was still around and arched to keep it in the\n    game!  \n\n9.  Another area ready for final inspect is a newbie area that I coded\n    myself,  The first 1/2 of the area, the halfling part is complete and\n    located in /players/tatsuo/halfling.  It will link up nicely with\n    the oppressing kobold area, the area contains a newbie level 3 star \n    quest.  I will have the kobold area working in less than a week.\n    At about the same time Ishikawa will reopen with inspection as\n    one of those ULTRA high level areas,  It is far off and difficult to\n    get to.   Thumper also has an area approaching approval quickly, i will\n    advise when its ready for final inspect.  Bobo has commenced an area\n    with the same theme as his clan.\n\n10.  You were right about Exos being pissed.  At first he declared to \n     the masses that he was quitting HM.  This was soon changed to his\n     badmouthing me at every chance, publically.  I have not snooped, \n     interfered with or lied about him to anyone during this period.\n     Last night his chastising included talking publically about \n     opening a munchkin/midget infested area.  This offends two fold\n     He knows that I myself am terrified of midgets (blush), its\n     irrational, but Turbo knows me and told exos about it.  Secondly\n     and more offensive is Airbornes reaction if he happened to log\n     on during this.   I don't give a shit about him talking about it.\n     (but if a midget walked in the door, i would be out the back door!)\n     He is just being very bitter, and does not contribute,  He was again\n     very pissed 4 days ago when players asked me for help rather than\n     him and ignored him when he showed up to help.  ( it was an alias \n     problem with the single alias bug)  He doesn't contribute he\n     just uses that tongue of his as poison.  Do what you will.  I make\n     no suggestions.  I personally dispise him because of his multiple\n     sexual harassment episodes that i know are factual.\n\nThat about wraps up everything I can think of at the moment.  I believe that\nwe need some short term fixes that are easy to implement before we start \naddressing the long term problems.\n\nOh yeah.\n\n11.  When can we kick up to 3 to 5 day reboot.\n     Hope you can do it asap.\n\nTatsuo\n\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: redsexy\nDate: Mar  6\n\n\nQC complete\nWas excellent\n\nYou don't even need to go through it.

THIS IS WHAT I WANT DONE NOW!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI want wizards to be able to help newbies.  Yes, actually take them killing\nshow them the MUD, tell them information and directions they may\notherwise not find out, get them get items.\n\nFAILIURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS WILL RESULT IN ME LEAVING\nTHE MUD FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER AND EVER AND SULKING\nEVERY TIME YOUR NAME IS MENTIONED!!!!!!\n\nOhhh laugh out loud.\n\nSeriously though, I think if there's only a clueless newbie and a wiz\nthe rules on interaction can afford to be relaxed a little.  The two \noptions are you give them basic directions and hope they find some\nweapons or something or you log off your wiz character and come\non with your player character and hope they don't associate the two.\nIt may sound like an alien concept, but there are people who don't\nknow that \"n\" is an abbreviation for \"north\".  I came in on this\nguy having a conversation with the Paperboy.\n\nIn my opinion (and I'm not suggesting this as a \"norm\", I'm a very\nlenient person anyway...) there is no harm in a wiz helping a newbie\nget up to level 5, provided there's no cloning of weapons, no\ngiving away of money (even then, what's the harm in 1000 coins?)\nand no quest hints invovled.  If anything, having a wiz help \na newbie SHOULD turn them into a good player.\n(get them into the habit of examining things in rooms, etc.).\nOK, we should be concentrating on coding or something wizlike.\nBut what's the point in coding if no-one's gonna be around to\nenjoy the code.\n\nOther stuff?  Ohhh there's plenty of other stuff, trust me :-)\nBut it can wait.\n\nIf you're dead set against this idea, I understand why.\nIt goes against everything we've ever been taught about\nwizplayer interaction.\n\nIf not then congratulations!\n\nYou've just had a \"playerkeeping\" idea!\n\nGet it implemented!\n\nDo it unexpectedly!\n\nWatch everyone run around in \ncircles of confusion!\n\nYour mentee,\n\nRedsexy\n\nPS I've also made some brief posts about the MUD on various sites\nand bulletin boards.

The 10k gold you get for slaying Garschmirak is quite pathetic. What\ndragon would have such a little hoard. THinking about this i got an idea.\nWhat if a monster of big caliber would guard a fountain that fulfills a wish\nif you drink from it. The wish could be for example an increasement in\na stat. Like +5 to anything you want, BUT not permanantly, just untill reboot,\nand one could have only one wish on a stat or maybe only one stat increasing\nwish at one time. You could also wish for experience and get some, like 50-100\nthousand, but the monster[s] guarding it would give much more, so it's only\nnominal, but it makes it more interesting. Eg if you alredy wished for a\nstat and an hour later you hack up all the guards again and couldn't wish for\na stat increasement you can wish for exp, or for a weapon or armor, and there\ncould be several different magic items available and when you wish for a weapon, you get a random weapon or one selected for your guild or whatever.\n                                             \nwell, see you\n                                              Ati\n\n**\nexos\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Rwhere\nDate: Mar 11\n\nI went to enter those rwhere addresses.\nI guess I don't have access to ARCH directories!\n\nI'd assume we are using Sauron's copy.\n\n**\ncantus\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: /players/turbo/MANGLA.c\nCc: exos tatsuo\nDate: Mar 11\n\nAll ready for inspection.

I haven't updated the\nfiles to point to the Guild Master yet - should be simple enough\nbut if you could change the GM for me, much appreciated.\n\n2) The guild would work fine as is.  Its vastly underpowered after\nsuch a long absence and I know there's got to be thorough testing,\nbut I'm telling you this for a couple of reasons:\n  a) I can start testing now and play around with various powers\n    to get them in line with other guilds - or -\n\n   b) I can go about stripping down the code now and THEN\n  get on to testing.\n\nThe basic code is going to be easy to play around with (creatures,\narmour, objects) - but the actual soul code is different from\nall the others I've worked on.  There are a lot of \"add_action\"s\nin it which I'm sure could be handled better but this could take\nmonths to fix.  I don't mind spending that time doing it,\nbut its as much of a learning process as a doing process for me.\n\nWhat I would suggest is:\n\n1) I test the guild and try not to crash the MUD.\n2) I alter creature and spell power accordingly.\n3) I tidy up creature and object code.\n4) Re-test - make sure.\n5) We open the guild (cue fanfare)..\n6) I set about recoding the add_actions in soul one by one...\n\nTHe one thing I wanted to ask was about spells.  At the moment these\nare in \"/players/redsexy/guild/spells\" and that dir doesn't\nload as all spells are referrential to declarations in the soul.\nIs that standard?\n\nActually if I could get someone to show me how to move an add_action\nto a bin command that'd be cool.

I have layed out many reasons why i want to be arch\nand i am consistantly put off and ignored.  The arches want to do everything behind \nclosed doors.  I am sending this letter to Mangla, who of all the arches, is the\nonly one that codes, and has been here, and who has admittedly pointed out that\nhe forgets things, and misses things, because of everything that needs done.\n\nCoding for HM is something that I enjoy to the fullest, but it has not been fun.\nAt every turn I have an archwizard speaking down at me, lying about me or at\nleast continuing an untrue rumor to others, THIS IS LOGGED, I have sent it to \nmangla.  We have archwizards who last coded 5 years ago.  We have archwizards\nwith outside commitments that take up space here.  We have archwizards that\ntake off 5 months and turn up like messiahs reasserting their rightful positions\nand casting down judgements. And we have one coding arch.\n\nFor 3 and one half years I watched the mud go through death throws, as players\nand wizards were driven off by shitty policies, guild closings, and the mud\nbeing moved around( all reasons I have heard).  Sauron, of the beloved\nninja guild had 3.5 years to recode ninja, he also had 3.5 years to\nput the monk into a bin system, and do something to balance it.  It just wasn't\ndone.  I do not know what he has done, but i can only speak of what wasn't done,\nand ask if opening and fixing these guilds was less important that what was done.\n\nThere was plenty of time for these people to \"shit or get off the pot\".\nIt wasn't done.  For those of you who do not know, or who have prescribed to\nthe rumors that abound.  I was banned by mistake.  I was kept away and put\noff without reason.  Untrustworty was heard. All sorts of things.\nFor the brief time i was unbanned, i was NEVER returned to my position,\nalthough it was a mistake that i lost it.  I was kept and treated as\na wiz with suspicion, and comments being made about me.  It sucked.\n\nI was restored to my position.  Airborne said it was a check on Mangla.\nMangla said it was to bring back HM.  Silas voted for me cause i asked him.\nIn the time that i made elder, I restored the ninja with wilbie, tinman,\nand bobo, restored the summoners with redsexy.  recruited and set up\n7 new Gm's, reviewed and opened 5 areas, coded a clan system, and fixed\n2 whole areas.  There is much more that needs done.  And i log on every\nday to find some social archwizard speaking down from above.  Or active\nones talking down about me or to me.  Telling me what is wrong with me, \nand refusing to listen to all the facts established about what is wrong\nwith what they have done.  I have done archwizard work.  I was an archwizard.\nI have used elder position to help everyone on here, even the assholes.\n\nMany other wizards have been inspired to come back, but that momentum is dying.\nThey have been put off, forgotten, while the ALL important archwizards\nsit back for a month to discuss things.  Redsexy was ignored for a year.\nHer area forgotten.  Bobo has done more coding than any other person\nat his rank, he is ignored and put off.  I don't blame him for cutting back.\nThere are wizards that are banished and wanted to come back, but they are\nignored.  And Exos is still here even after the testimony of 7 or 8 people\nattested to his absolute wrongdoings.\n\nAfter the ninja guild was restored, players and wizards started calling for\nnew archwizards with my name being mentioned many times.  These people were\ntold point blank to shut the hell up.  I have no conception of what\nyou arches have going on in that little room, and what bullshit ideas are\nfloating around.  But face it. One coding arch, isn't going to cut it.\nThe mud blew up in sargons workroom, understandings were reached, Then ignored.\nThat Tuesday came and went a month ago.  The old ways are no longer needed.\nWho is gonna help you put in the 100 level system? Airborne? Silas?\nKryll?, maybe Warlord and Uglymoth.  Maybe Sauron when he comes back from\nhis next extended vacation.  Hello, Tatsuo has the ability, and has shown it.\nThe mantras of me being some evil son of a bitch won't work forever when\nthey are demonstrably untrue.  You know what Redsexy is right, I am BOTH.\n\nI cannot fathom the resistance to the move when everything points to a positive.\nWhen there is a chance to remove the dead weight and move up the people\nthat are bringing back the players.  The momentum as you put it is starting to slip\nwith the players.  I can spark it back up.  I will claim responsibility\nfor a large percent of the comeback that is started.  I give the rest to the\npeople who have been ignored and put off.  From what i know, there are\npotentially 3 mudlib level coders on the game besides you Mangla.\nThose are your archwizards.\nTatsuo, Wilbie, and Sargon.\n\nPlease stop bogarting the highest position in the game when others can fill \nthose positions.  calling kryll to login hasn't made him come back and fix the\nplace. and saurons instant appearance also has done little but piss me off.\nPut the level where the level belongs.  With the people that code this place,\nand enjoy it.\n\nYou want the 100 level system in, arch those people.\nYou want the guilds running and balanced, arch those people.\nYou want players coming back, arch those people.\nYou want new players, arch those people.\nYou want wizards coding and being helped with code, arch those people.\nYou want Holy Mission back, arch those people.\n\nIf you want things the way they were. Sit back and dicuss things some more with\nthe deadbeats that brought her down.\nMake some changes, shake the boat. Take action, make it fun.\nIf not, I am outta here.  \n\nI have forwarded this to every wiz that gives a damn, and i will ask that\nthese wizzes write their feelings to MANGLA and cc it to TATSUO.  I want\na clean and open debate.  I also ask that it not be sent to other arches\nwhose feelings may be hurt by it.  That is not my intention.  I i have\nspoken an untruth, let it be known.  If i am right, tell mangla to fix the\nplace.\n\nTatsuo, for Holy Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**\nakira\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: mail\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nI recently reseved a letter that had some stronge statements made in it.\nOdds are you know the one I am talking about.

The answer would seem to be with the arches. I have\nno clue what you guys do, but I see what you don't do, and this is help\nthis place. We need new arches and new changes to be made.

When we bump into each other, he converses with me. I constantly see him on here and he has never EVER said anything like \"Well hold on. I'm busy.\"\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding. But once I met people like Tatsuo and Redsexy who were this friendly, I haven't even tried one of the other 500 muds on this list of mine. That should show how attractive this place is.

Let me start\nby saying this.  No matter how much we say that this is only a game, it is\nalso a great part of our lives.  I see the hours everyone puts in here and\nthere's no way any of us can deny that what goes on in the MUD effects\nwhat goes on in our lives.  I say this because everyone involved in this\ndebate is a friend of mine, one way or another.  I hope I haven't\ncome out as being too hypocritical in any of this.  I think I have\nstood up for what is right, and I think I have praised when praise\nhas been due and criticized when criticism is necessary.  But it\nis always the action I criticize, not the person behind it.\n\nSo I will say here what I have said to you all individually. And I will\nstart by praising what Tatsuo has done for Holy Mission.  He has\nturned the MUD around, that is undeniable.  I could go through the\nlist of things he has achieved (I'm sure he'd like me to do that)\nbut we all know what he has done here.  He is a motivational leader,\nwithout him I doubt I would have hung around for so long.\n\nI will also agree that the coding effort around here was appalling\nup until a few months ago.  Now Tatsuo and Sauron narrowly missed\neach other, but this much was obvious.  When Sauron went away\na LOT of projects fell by the wayside.  It was the final\nstraw in my prolonged absence (alongside my area not being looked at)\nand I know one or two others who had stuff going on that could\nonly be worked on with Sauron.  I think Tatsuo underestimates\nSauron's ability to code and the amount of stuff that is ready to\nship.  At the same time, in doing the lib stuff, monk was neglected.\nCoding here falls into two categories: The visible and the invisible.\nSauron was working on the invisible stuff RIGHT up till his\nabsence.  He was putting in 18 hours a day here some times. And not\njust socialising - far from it.  But there's no way monk \nshould have been left to rot for so long so visibly.  Gives\npeople the wrong impression.\n\nAnd as for Airborne and Mangla in the period up until I went away -\nI can't really comment.  Mangla was working with me on jedi, Airborne -\nI don't think I've seen Airborne code anything since 1993.  But\nmaybe he's the same as Sauron and keeps his achievements quiet?\n(actually that bit about Airborne - I *do* remember him recoding the\nBaal Rog quest).  But a revamped quest and new skills for one\nguild do not a happy MUD make.  Everyone was lax because HM was dying.\nIt took Tatsuo to wake some of us up to the fact that HM could be\ngreat again.\n\nTatsuo has livened up place, but in doing so livened up the arches.\nAnd now he too wants to be an arch.  But the arches have reservations.\n\nThis is where it all gets a bit blurry.  I hear one story from one side\nand then another story from Tatsuo.  I can understand the initial concern for\nnot making Tatsuo an arch.  He has a reputation.  He goes on crusades that\nwear everyone down.  There are questions about his coding ability. You never\nget a moment's peace when he is online.  And not forgetting the security\nconcerns.  The fact he doesn't tow the traditional arch-line.\nThe fact there are people he would remove within the second on promtion.\nAnd the biggest reason for Tatsuo not being arched of course.\n\"There are no arch positions\".  That brings me nicely onto Silas.\n\nWhat IS Silas doing now?  Why is he still an arch here?  OK I'm gonna stay\ncalm about this, but I would like to know if he is going to be inclided\nin the quarterly reviews.  Silas is one of the friendliest, nicest\npeople on here.  But if he's not doing anything for the MUD (as far as we\nare aware) then I really think that should be looked at.\n\nI sound like Tatsuo's yes woman.  I have disagreed with him on many things.\nI sometimes find he exaggerates statistics and his charisma can sometimes\nborder on the edge of manipulation.  But if he says fifteen players want\nsomething, he will go out and find those fifteen players who want it.\nAnd I'm not even saying Tatsuo should be your first choice arch.\nYou all know I'm not backing Exos on this either, Exos is, for all\nintents and purposes GONE.\n\nNow let me bring this back round to me and my life.  You may think\nI got involved in this because I like stirring trouble.  Or because I like\nthe sound of my own writing.  That's not the reason I got involved at all.\nFirst I saw Tatsuo personally attacking Mangla and I didn't like it.\nThen Tatsuo explained to me why he was attacking Mangla and I saw his\nreasons, but didn't approve of his methods.  Between us (and I hope he\ndoesn't mind me taking the credit a little) we worked that one out.\nBut things exploded again when Sauron came in.  Again I'm seeing Tatsuo\nfrustrated, and again I am getting mixed stories.  You know what?\nI've been here for eight years, I can barely remember what I got banished\nfor, let alone expect anyone else to remember.  I'd love to get you\nall in a room together and tell me exactly what you've all told ME\n(er - make that tell each other what you've all told me).\n\nCommunication is the key that is missing here.\n\nTatsuo.  Look at what Sauron has done as opposed to knocking him for stuff\nhe didn't do.  Try talking to the arches without insulting them.\n\nArches, the whole lot of ya.  Listen to Tatsuo.  Don't arbitarily threaten\nhim with banishment. Yes, I know I have suggested banishment myself.\nAnd I still go with that.  If you are not going to Arch him then banish him.\nYou're going to say that you have listened to Tatsuo.  I know you're going\nto say that you've had as much Tatsuo as you can take.  The thing is,\nas many different viewpoints of an event there are, there is only one set of\nfacts.  Someone along the way is lying or seriously mislead in their beliefs.\n\nEveryone.  Please treat each other with respect.  Do not judge without\nhard facts.  Do not launch into mindless attacks on each other.  I can\nhonestly say I haven't said anything to anyone that I would be ashamed\nof having distributed.  I will gladly sit in a room with you all\nand defend everything I've said here.\n\nIf Tatsuo goes, and seeing as Exos is as good as gone, who are we going\nto have left?\n\nI guess I'll start work on master.c now then?\n\nRed\n\n**\nsargon\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo's mail\nCc: redsexy tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nHere are my thoughts. \nBasically this can be broken down into 2 parts.\n1.  Current status of arches and their contributions.\n2.  Tatsuo's desire to be Arch\n\n1.  The current satus of arches is not great.  We have two active arches and one who codes.\n  Mangla has been here through thick and thin and has taken a ton of shit from every \ndirection.  I've had very few problems with him that haven't been worked out.  \nHe has \nasked for my advice on issues and gotten it and he's given me coding help many times. \n He is approchable and open to new suggestions that are workable.  He holds the highest \ncredibility with me...i can't speak for others.  This is my experience with Mangla.\nIn my view the single most important quality of being a wizard or arch wizard is\n\ncredibility.  People can be taught to code, but honesty and a solid recognition of right and \n\nwrong are things that one needs to have as a foundation.  Without it they should not be wiz \n\nor arch.  There are many things which have been promised and not accomplished and \n\npinning the blame on Mangla is at once unfair and misdirected.  There are/were 4 other \n\narches who also promised these things.  Mangla cannot be expected to bear the brunt of all \n\nof their shortcomings.   As I said, he has stuck it out and coded while other arches didn't. \n \nTo remove or want Mangla removed is arrogant and stupid.\n\n\n\n2.  Tatsuo asks that if he has spoken an untruth in his mail to us that we bring it up.  I \nwon't say that he's delibrately misled, but I will say that he has distorted some facts, \nintentional or not.  First, Exos and I had been looking into the guild master problem for \nsome time and i've approached Mangla concerning this problem even before Tatsuo was \nback.  I told Mangla that I would like to be GM of fighter guild and recruit Bobo and \nWilbie to look into other guilds that have been missing GM's.  I wanted Red to do Jedi \nalso.  Even though Tatsuo has done an enormous amount to get HM back and enstill \nenthusiasm here again there are things that others have been doing before and now continue \nto do...just because we don't post on every little thing we do doesn't mean it isn't being \ndone.  So actually, Tatsuo exagerates the point of Gms.\n\n\tTatsuo also exagerates of the review of areas.  There were many of us involved in \nreviewing areas, specifically Redsexy's.  Not that Tatsuo didnt' contribute to this, more or \nless than others, but his point is that HE did it alone.  This is also an exageration.\n\n\tAsk yourself this;  If someone told you 10 things and 2 were exagerations or false, \nand these things you know about, what are you to think of the other 8 things they tell you?  \nCredibility IS the issue.  Tatsuo may be capable of being Arch in technical areas, but he \nleaves too many questions in other areas.  He should be promoted to Arch only when he \nhas demonstrated that he can be trusted to be stable and credible.  In my opinion, he must \nbe able to work with Mangla.  He can do all these things.  When he does, I will put in my \nsupport for him as an arch.\n\n\tAs for the rest of the mail from Tatsuo, I will not respond.  I will only discuss \nmatters of which I have first hand knowledge and won't get into dragging anyone in the \nmud.\n\n\tThese are my opinions.\n\n\n  Sargon\nHope the format is easy to read...copying into mailer was a pain.\n\n\n**\ntinman\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nI think what tatsuo says is true.  the mud died because of all the changes\nand being a arch here you have responsibility.  And people who lack the\nresponsibility should be taken off arch immediately.  Once people see\nhow great hm was and what it really was.  I can even say i left hm because\nof lack of work being done and no one gives a damn about the mud but Tatsuo\ncan make a difference.  He made me realized the mud can change.  Therefore\ni have help him with the ninja guild.  He show me many things that can\nbe added to improve hm.  I say why don't we just give tatsuo a try.  \nare you afraid of him??  if so, you can watch him and see his ability\nto work. you will find your suspiouicans are wrong.  This mud will die\nagain and make all the people here lost hope if nothing is being done.\nI have talk to a few people about hm.  they say the arch doesn't care\nabout the mud anymore and at the moment they have saw tatsuo making\nchanges which made people come back.  and actually take a look at this place.\nLet us not neglect hm again.  Give Tatsuo the arch position.\n\nTinman\n\n**\ntinman\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: guilds.txt\nDate: Mar 22\n\n\nI was also working on the ninja guild, you forgot my name in that\ndoc.  and i wonder if i can work on the druid guild.  \n--> Proposing.\n\nTinman\n\n**\nnobunaga\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\n\nI am a really old player of Holy Mission, was Jaer.  I have seen\nmany things happen on this mud.  This was my first mud have played\nand it was so good in the beginning........Suddenly in the middle\nwith all the changes and the staff doing nothing.  I found out\nholy mission was getting boring and becoming bullshit.  Until recently\ni have come back due to the fact that something is being done.\nThe arches gives promise which they never live up to.  (some even)\nlike the ninja guild being fixed and stuff.  I have found out Tatsuo\nwould make a great arch since he is willing to spend time for this mud\nwhich a lot of us have neglected.  If i am betray by the wiz on this\nmud, i will never come back to this mud anymore and i will of course\ngive hm a bad name, which the wiz cannot be trusted.  Man i miss\nthe old times of hm.  Wish we can become back the way we were.\n\nNobunaga\nI think Tatsuo can hold that promise making hm back the way it was.\n\n**\nthumper\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Holy Mission\nCc: tatsuo,sargon\nDate: Mar 22\n\nMangla,\nI see by the files that exos still exists on HM.  I would\nhave thought that after all the complaints that you got that\nthis matter would have been delt with by now.  I would ask why\nyou are dragging your feet on this, but knowing your responses\nin the past I would just get more of the same.  BS from an Arch\nwho does little to punish wrong doings, and lets those who are\ntrying to get this mud up again flounder on thier own.  Tatsuo\nhas done much to get HM standing again and to get new blood\nhere.  Yet you still put off making him an Arch. WHY? Are you\nso insecure that you feel threatened by him.  You have Arches\nhere who are missing half the time, and the other half they\njust wish to be social.  This place needs a heart transplant and \ngetting rid of dead arches who could care less would be a step\nin the right direction.  (You know when I first came to HM it\nwas awsome. Half the time it was so full I had to wait to log in.\nNow , well lets just say there is room to spare. I personally can't\nbelieve this is what you want for a mud where you are an arch.)\nSometimes change is good mangla, it does not need thinking about, \nor committees.  Just DO IT!\nWould you want to be a player here?\nThumper\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: thumper\nSubj: Exos\nCc: arches\nDate: Mar 22\n\nI have a set of complaints, and we are watching to catch\nhim in the act. So far the only act was have caught him in\nis talking to kitty. Nothing threatening. If he is guilty,\nthen he will slip up. At that time, caught red-handed,\nwe will do it. Have some patience. It will be addressed.\n\nAs for Tatsuo. That will be taken care of in its own\ntime also. There are many many facts that have been\nleft out. There are no insecurity issues.\n\n-Mangla\narches\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: this arch stuff\nCc: sargon, akira, uruz, tatsuo, bobo, tinman, redsexy, airborne\nDate: Mar 22\n\nLeaving all personal issues aside, and leaving all political bullshit aside,\nI think Tatsuo and the others who have spoken up have some good points.\nWhether that means new arches or just new roles for lower levels, the fact\nremains that we need change.\n\nRight now we have one active arch.  In order to accomplish everything that \nneeds to be done here, that just won't do.  We either need new arches or the\narches need to pass on some roles to the elders.  It's very simple.\n\nThis is not a rip on Airborne, or any other arch.  Actually, let me rephrase\nthat part...  This is not a rip on Airborne, but it IS a rip on the others.\nAirborne still logs in, and he still makes a visible effort.  But the fact\nremains that Mangla is the only arch who plays a primary role in Holy Mission.\nMangla makes the decisions.  Mangla makes the policy.  Airborne acts as sort\nof a check - just to keep things balanced.\n\nAs for the other arches, how in the hell can a person be considered an arch\nwhen they never log on and do anything?  Popping in now and then to vote on\nsomething that you don't even care about doesn't count.\n\nThis is also not a rip on Mangla.  Personally, I have no problem with Mangla.\nThe problem I have is that Mangla (purposely or not) has placed the entire\nMud on his shoulders.  One person just doesn't cut it.  It doesn't matter if\nyou have the best intentions in the world.  One person does not make a mud.\n\nPersonally, I think Tatsuo would make a very good arch.  Quite frankly, I \nthink a great number of the people we have right now would make great arches.\nLet's stop thinking of the \"arch\" position as some elite rank.  It's just \nanother level with more work involved.  If someone has the ability, and the\ndesire, they should be given the opportunity to do the work.  \n\nThey certainly have more business with that rank than someone who never\nlogs in.\n\nOne last thing, for the record.  I don't want to be an arch.  If raising my\nlevel will help me help this mud then yes, I'm all for promotion.  Promote\nme to whatever I can best help you with.  To me, that's all rank is.  It's\naccess to do more good for the Mud.\n\n**\ntetsuhara\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: Archood\nCc: mangla\nDate: Mar 22\n\nwell....lots of things said in all that.......\nhaving been a player for the better part of six years i think i've seen a lot\nof what's gone on from the players perspective..... although this doesn't\ngive me authority to say whats gone on behind the scenes as it were, its\nstill painfully obvious to anyone who plays for an extended period that things\naren't running as smoothly as they should.....\n\nfrom the point of view of the work done by wizzes, elders and arches.... there\nis definitely a trend towards who is actually working and who is on for the more\nsocial aspects of the mud...\n\ncredit given where its due... given the amount of time elapsed since tatsuo's\nbanning and subsequent re-instatement (well almost) isn't it obvious that  \nthe fears of wrong-doing were ill-founded?\n\non the subject of propsing wizzes or elders that should be arches... i must\nadmit that i was more than a little peeved at being slapped down for the suggestion.....\nconsidering that a lot of players log far more time on the mud at the moment\nwould'n't it make sense to take on board suggestions rather than dismissing\nthem out of hand?  one would almost think that these players didn't have the\nexperience and the prior knowledge of the way the mud operates to make a\nsimple nomination......\n\n\nanyway.... there's some more two-cents worth of opinion......\n\ntets.\n\n**\nwidge\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo 4 arch\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 23\n\nDear Mangla\nWell having read all that Tats had to say, I can honestly back him up for the position of arch wiz. Like Psi says, Tatsuo is a very nice guy who always has time to talk and basically doesnt treat us lower level players (like me LL1) like we are worth \nnothing. I have noticed that many arches and those high up (I dont refer to you here, i hardly know you) have disregarded the mud and only use their posotion for their own advantage.\nTatsuo to me seems more than capable of fulfilling the role of arch, he is on here regularly, and I sincerely hope that he is promoted. As he says, one particular arch, Exos, seems to do nothing but use his position for his own advantage, snooping on us \nplayers when we might well be engaged in some very private conversations, like myself.\nThis is a very serious concern of mine, and its making me think of leaving the mud again if this matter is not addressed. Indeed others ma be doing the same thing, and whats worse is that us players have no way of knowing.\nI think Tatsuo would make a trustworthy arch who would not abuse his position. I believe Tatsuo can encourage people to like and trust the mud and its people again, like myself. \n\nTatsuo for arch ...........restore the mud to its former glory, banish those high up who do nothing for it.........lets make it enjoyable for everyone NOW\n\n**\nbobo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Patience dir\nDate: Mar 23\n\nI would like to have access to it, it would benefit my coding efforts of Ezo\ngreatly.

I've read the letter he wrote to you about this topic.\nThe 'political' part of it does not interest me, as politics on muds\nnever did as long as they didn't hurt me.\nThe part that's about thet \nthet=that is about that Tatsuo would like to take resposibility in coding\nthe lib does interest me howerver. As far as i know Tatsuo is a skilled\ncoder, and what is at least this important is that he has the time to\ncode here.\nThe last time when there was noticeable coding on HM (at least for me)\nwas at the time when Llort was still here and coding the mages guild.\nThis is all i have to say, and i think it's quite enough.\n                                    Ati the somewhat faithful player of HM\n\n**\nredsexy\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Wiz list so far\nDate: Mar 24\n\n/players/redsexy/secure/actwiz\n\nSauron updated location logs :-)\n\n\n**\nuruz\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Strange Days\nDate: Mar 24\n\nWell, seems you've gotten the point from severasl people.\nWhile I don't ahve\nhave a problem with coding, there is a problem with finding arches\nor anyone else to help/get things done.\nI believe Tatsuo has proved himself in the past, and does so right\nnow. HE apparently is very willing to put the time and effort in.\nI suppoert him 100%. But if he leaves, I seriously doubt that anyone\nwill fill his shoes.

There is a very good chance that\nI'll be returning to active coding in a few weeks.  I still need some time \naway from this place, but not as much as I originally intended to take.\nFor the record, it was never my intention to leave forever - I just wasn't\nsure when or if I would want to code again.  After some thought, I think\nthat a few weeks should be enough time to cool off with.\n\nAs I'm sure you realize, things are going to have to change for this mud\nto work.  I won't get into specifics right now, because frankly I don't\nhave all the specifics.

The reason that i would guess this is that\nthe undercity coded by appollo no longer works.  As i remember the thieves\nguild used to be numbered 1, yet now it is numbered 5, this makes the undercity no \nlonger work, this could have effected other things, just wanted to let you know, if you oculd let me know what the changes have been that would be appreciated,\ni have a room in my area that is guild specific that will\nneed to be fixed.\n\n\nTHe sprain**\n\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: random list of cloneable items\nCc: sargon\nDate: Apr  4\n\nI am trying to make a random cloning of treasure for a mob\nFor details, see\n/p/t/monsters/artifact/teekas_dragon.c\n\nthank you\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: /players/mangla/guild/obj/parry_shad.c\nCc: sargon\nDate: Apr  4\n\nWhen there is time, I need this broken down into english.\n\n**\nsargon\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Error in player object\nCc: sargon\nDate: Apr  4\n\nHi\nWhen logging i was in a void.\nTried to quit and got the following error message.\nBad argument 1 to call_other()\nprogram: sys/player.c\nobject : sys/wiz#7151\nline   : 1406\n\nWent netdead and came back and all is well except there are two of me.\nAnd you don't want two of me:)\n\n  Sargon\nI'll copy myself to be sure my format of the error came through.\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: turbo\nSubj: bard skill\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr  8\n\n     One of the bard skills somehow allows a bard to sidestep a backstab.\nThis does not make snese to me, how can you sidestep an attack that\nyou do not know is coming, it is not even like the bard guild is a guild who \nis incredibly dextrious.  If there is a valid skill reason for this, I\nwould like to know, otherwise it should be changed, thieves are meant\nto rely on this one skill, backstab, for most of their damage and it is\na onetime only attack, if it is going to be blocked by your guild\nI need to decide what that means towards my guilds skills\n\nBrainsprain\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: brainsprain\nRe:   bard skill\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr  8\n\nskill?  I can think of a spell, irish luck, but a skill?\nIrish luck has a LONG recast time, and from my understanding of it\ngives AT BEST 15 dodges.  While this may seem like a lot,\n\nkeep in mind that the shadow lasts longer than 9000 seconds, \nwhich is the MAX time for their Armour of ithan.\n\nAlso, how did this come to be known?\nWhy was a thief backstabbing a bard to begin with.\nOh, and as far as not know its comming, that is why its called\nIrish Luck.  Luck can account for a lot of things, including \navoiding an attack you do not see coming.  While the message this dodge\nreturns may not be descriptive of the attack,\nthat does not disqualify it.\nAfter all, as a player, I have pounded skeletons into a pile of blood\nand body parts many times.\n\nThe message may be innaccurate, but the effect is the same.\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: turbo\nSubj: in reply to both\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr  8\n\nYeah, arches will mail all of the arches, i think wizzes works as well\nto send to everybody.\n\nAs to to skill or spell, that is fine, what happened was malice and treat\nwere in the arena and I was watching the battle over malices shoulder.\nI watched treat sidestep a backstab, which made no sense whatsoever to me.
