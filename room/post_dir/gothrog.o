It must\nbe serious !!\nWe'll be there..with junior in tow of course !\nI'll not be working and David can take his holidays whenever he wants so\nany time suits us. Is it going to be the works or a small do ?\nYou'll have to write and tell us all about it  :)\n\nWhat else have you been up to lately then ? \nWe're decorating at the mo...the nursery ....I can't wait til its finished\nits getting exciting.....you wouldn't recognise me anymore..I'm huge !!!!!\nI feel possessed at the mo...it won't stop wriggling around and kicking me !\n\nWe were on holiday a few weeks ago...it was dreadful...a week on the Norfolk\nBroads on a boat and it rained for 6 out of the 7 days !\nI mean rain ! Not just showers but monsoon weather which kinda ruined it abit.\nI couldn't wait to get home to my cosy house and freedom from my Mum and Dad\nwho were really getting on my nerves being in a confined space . It could\nhave been good if we could have got off the boat and had our own freedom\nbut the weather had other plans !!\nIt was certainly an experience...one I never want to repeat ...but an\nexperience all the same !!\nTake my advice ...don't go on holiday with your parents in a potentially\nsmall space.....murder could ensue !1\n\nHows the new job going ? I've only 7 weeks left of mine then no more work\nfor a year or two  *GRIN*\n\nWell its time for me to head for bed so take care...\n\nLove Diane\n\n**\n"
