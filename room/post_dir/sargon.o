I have layed out many reasons why i want to be arch\nand i am consistantly put off and ignored.  The arches want to do everything behind \nclosed doors.  I am sending this letter to Mangla, who of all the arches, is the\nonly one that codes, and has been here, and who has admittedly pointed out that\nhe forgets things, and misses things, because of everything that needs done.\n\nCoding for HM is something that I enjoy to the fullest, but it has not been fun.\nAt every turn I have an archwizard speaking down at me, lying about me or at\nleast continuing an untrue rumor to others, THIS IS LOGGED, I have sent it to \nmangla.  We have archwizards who last coded 5 years ago.  We have archwizards\nwith outside commitments that take up space here.  We have archwizards that\ntake off 5 months and turn up like messiahs reasserting their rightful positions\nand casting down judgements. And we have one coding arch.\n\nFor 3 and one half years I watched the mud go through death throws, as players\nand wizards were driven off by shitty policies, guild closings, and the mud\nbeing moved around( all reasons I have heard).  Sauron, of the beloved\nninja guild had 3.5 years to recode ninja, he also had 3.5 years to\nput the monk into a bin system, and do something to balance it.  It just wasn't\ndone.  I do not know what he has done, but i can only speak of what wasn't done,\nand ask if opening and fixing these guilds was less important that what was done.\n\nThere was plenty of time for these people to \"shit or get off the pot\".\nIt wasn't done.  For those of you who do not know, or who have prescribed to\nthe rumors that abound.  I was banned by mistake.  I was kept away and put\noff without reason.  Untrustworty was heard. All sorts of things.\nFor the brief time i was unbanned, i was NEVER returned to my position,\nalthough it was a mistake that i lost it.  I was kept and treated as\na wiz with suspicion, and comments being made about me.  It sucked.\n\nI was restored to my position.  Airborne said it was a check on Mangla.\nMangla said it was to bring back HM.  Silas voted for me cause i asked him.\nIn the time that i made elder, I restored the ninja with wilbie, tinman,\nand bobo, restored the summoners with redsexy.  recruited and set up\n7 new Gm's, reviewed and opened 5 areas, coded a clan system, and fixed\n2 whole areas.  There is much more that needs done.  And i log on every\nday to find some social archwizard speaking down from above.  Or active\nones talking down about me or to me.  Telling me what is wrong with me, \nand refusing to listen to all the facts established about what is wrong\nwith what they have done.  I have done archwizard work.  I was an archwizard.\nI have used elder position to help everyone on here, even the assholes.\n\nMany other wizards have been inspired to come back, but that momentum is dying.\nThey have been put off, forgotten, while the ALL important archwizards\nsit back for a month to discuss things.  Redsexy was ignored for a year.\nHer area forgotten.  Bobo has done more coding than any other person\nat his rank, he is ignored and put off.  I don't blame him for cutting back.\nThere are wizards that are banished and wanted to come back, but they are\nignored.  And Exos is still here even after the testimony of 7 or 8 people\nattested to his absolute wrongdoings.\n\nAfter the ninja guild was restored, players and wizards started calling for\nnew archwizards with my name being mentioned many times.  These people were\ntold point blank to shut the hell up.  I have no conception of what\nyou arches have going on in that little room, and what bullshit ideas are\nfloating around.  But face it. One coding arch, isn't going to cut it.\nThe mud blew up in sargons workroom, understandings were reached, Then ignored.\nThat Tuesday came and went a month ago.  The old ways are no longer needed.\nWho is gonna help you put in the 100 level system? Airborne? Silas?\nKryll?, maybe Warlord and Uglymoth.  Maybe Sauron when he comes back from\nhis next extended vacation.  Hello, Tatsuo has the ability, and has shown it.\nThe mantras of me being some evil son of a bitch won't work forever when\nthey are demonstrably untrue.  You know what Redsexy is right, I am BOTH.\n\nI cannot fathom the resistance to the move when everything points to a positive.\nWhen there is a chance to remove the dead weight and move up the people\nthat are bringing back the players.  The momentum as you put it is starting to slip\nwith the players.  I can spark it back up.  I will claim responsibility\nfor a large percent of the comeback that is started.  I give the rest to the\npeople who have been ignored and put off.  From what i know, there are\npotentially 3 mudlib level coders on the game besides you Mangla.\nThose are your archwizards.\nTatsuo, Wilbie, and Sargon.\n\nPlease stop bogarting the highest position in the game when others can fill \nthose positions.  calling kryll to login hasn't made him come back and fix the\nplace. and saurons instant appearance also has done little but piss me off.\nPut the level where the level belongs.  With the people that code this place,\nand enjoy it.\n\nYou want the 100 level system in, arch those people.\nYou want the guilds running and balanced, arch those people.\nYou want players coming back, arch those people.\nYou want new players, arch those people.\nYou want wizards coding and being helped with code, arch those people.\nYou want Holy Mission back, arch those people.\n\nIf you want things the way they were. Sit back and dicuss things some more with\nthe deadbeats that brought her down.\nMake some changes, shake the boat. Take action, make it fun.\nIf not, I am outta here.  \n\nI have forwarded this to every wiz that gives a damn, and i will ask that\nthese wizzes write their feelings to MANGLA and cc it to TATSUO.  I want\na clean and open debate.  I also ask that it not be sent to other arches\nwhose feelings may be hurt by it.  That is not my intention.  I i have\nspoken an untruth, let it be known.  If i am right, tell mangla to fix the\nplace.\n\nTatsuo, for Holy Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: redsexy\nFwd:  Tatsuo / Archwiz\nCc: sargon, akira, uruz, waldo, wilbie, bobo, tinman, widge, icehouse, ati\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo / Archwiz\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nWell I'm only a beginner, and actually this is the 1st MUD i've ever been on. And I may not know much about what all the details are, but I can say that Tatsuo is someone on here who I could immediately tell that he knew what he was doing.\nWhen there was a bug, Tatsuo fixes it. When we bump into each other, he converses with me. I constantly see him on here and he has never EVER said anything like \"Well hold on. I'm busy.\"\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding. But once I met people like Tatsuo and Redsexy who were this friendly, I haven't even tried one of the other 500 muds on this list of mine. That should show how attractive this place is. And if all the other Archwizzes made it what it is today, I'm sure those two can help make it what it will be tomorrow.\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding.

We stand at a cross roads,\nit is no secret that this mud is dead, but there is hope. Recently the old\ncoders have returned, and with them some new players. This mud can be\ngreat once again. \"These are the time that try mens souls\" Henry V. I\nsay that because people don't seem to like change, it seems to try there\nsouls. Well its time to put the games aside and start to do what is best\nfor the mud. Tatsuo has shown that he can get things done. Why then do\nwe not let him do this. The answer would seem to be with the arches. I have\nno clue what you guys do, but I see what you don't do, and this is help\nthis place. We need new arches and new changes to be made. I FULLY suport\nthe ideas set forth by Tatsuo and some of the others wizes. Given this\nI stand with them and or walk with them, please let it be the former than\nthe latter.\n                                       Akira\n\n**\nredsexy\n**\nTo: sargon\nFwd:  Archood\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: tatsuo\nRe:   Archood\nCc: redsexy, mangla\nDate: Mar 22\n\nEveryone knows I am in a particularly awkward position on this one.  Let me start\nby saying this.  No matter how much we say that this is only a game, it is\nalso a great part of our lives.  I see the hours everyone puts in here and\nthere's no way any of us can deny that what goes on in the MUD effects\nwhat goes on in our lives.  I say this because everyone involved in this\ndebate is a friend of mine, one way or another.  I hope I haven't\ncome out as being too hypocritical in any of this.  I think I have\nstood up for what is right, and I think I have praised when praise\nhas been due and criticized when criticism is necessary.  But it\nis always the action I criticize, not the person behind it.\n\nSo I will say here what I have said to you all individually. And I will\nstart by praising what Tatsuo has done for Holy Mission.  He has\nturned the MUD around, that is undeniable.  I could go through the\nlist of things he has achieved (I'm sure he'd like me to do that)\nbut we all know what he has done here.  He is a motivational leader,\nwithout him I doubt I would have hung around for so long.\n\nI will also agree that the coding effort around here was appalling\nup until a few months ago.  Now Tatsuo and Sauron narrowly missed\neach other, but this much was obvious.  When Sauron went away\na LOT of projects fell by the wayside.  It was the final\nstraw in my prolonged absence (alongside my area not being looked at)\nand I know one or two others who had stuff going on that could\nonly be worked on with Sauron.  I think Tatsuo underestimates\nSauron's ability to code and the amount of stuff that is ready to\nship.  At the same time, in doing the lib stuff, monk was neglected.\nCoding here falls into two categories: The visible and the invisible.\nSauron was working on the invisible stuff RIGHT up till his\nabsence.  He was putting in 18 hours a day here some times. And not\njust socialising - far from it.  But there's no way monk \nshould have been left to rot for so long so visibly.  Gives\npeople the wrong impression.\n\nAnd as for Airborne and Mangla in the period up until I went away -\nI can't really comment.  Mangla was working with me on jedi, Airborne -\nI don't think I've seen Airborne code anything since 1993.  But\nmaybe he's the same as Sauron and keeps his achievements quiet?\n(actually that bit about Airborne - I *do* remember him recoding the\nBaal Rog quest).  But a revamped quest and new skills for one\nguild do not a happy MUD make.  Everyone was lax because HM was dying.\nIt took Tatsuo to wake some of us up to the fact that HM could be\ngreat again.\n\nTatsuo has livened up place, but in doing so livened up the arches.\nAnd now he too wants to be an arch.  But the arches have reservations.\n\nThis is where it all gets a bit blurry.  I hear one story from one side\nand then another story from Tatsuo.  I can understand the initial concern for\nnot making Tatsuo an arch.  He has a reputation.  He goes on crusades that\nwear everyone down.  There are questions about his coding ability. You never\nget a moment's peace when he is online.  And not forgetting the security\nconcerns.  The fact he doesn't tow the traditional arch-line.\nThe fact there are people he would remove within the second on promtion.\nAnd the biggest reason for Tatsuo not being arched of course.\n\"There are no arch positions\".  That brings me nicely onto Silas.\n\nWhat IS Silas doing now?  Why is he still an arch here?  OK I'm gonna stay\ncalm about this, but I would like to know if he is going to be inclided\nin the quarterly reviews.  Silas is one of the friendliest, nicest\npeople on here.  But if he's not doing anything for the MUD (as far as we\nare aware) then I really think that should be looked at.\n\nI sound like Tatsuo's yes woman.  I have disagreed with him on many things.\nI sometimes find he exaggerates statistics and his charisma can sometimes\nborder on the edge of manipulation.  But if he says fifteen players want\nsomething, he will go out and find those fifteen players who want it.\nAnd I'm not even saying Tatsuo should be your first choice arch.\nYou all know I'm not backing Exos on this either, Exos is, for all\nintents and purposes GONE.\n\nNow let me bring this back round to me and my life.  You may think\nI got involved in this because I like stirring trouble.  Or because I like\nthe sound of my own writing.  That's not the reason I got involved at all.\nFirst I saw Tatsuo personally attacking Mangla and I didn't like it.\nThen Tatsuo explained to me why he was attacking Mangla and I saw his\nreasons, but didn't approve of his methods.  Between us (and I hope he\ndoesn't mind me taking the credit a little) we worked that one out.\nBut things exploded again when Sauron came in.  Again I'm seeing Tatsuo\nfrustrated, and again I am getting mixed stories.  You know what?\nI've been here for eight years, I can barely remember what I got banished\nfor, let alone expect anyone else to remember.  I'd love to get you\nall in a room together and tell me exactly what you've all told ME\n(er - make that tell each other what you've all told me).\n\nCommunication is the key that is missing here.\n\nTatsuo.  Look at what Sauron has done as opposed to knocking him for stuff\nhe didn't do.  Try talking to the arches without insulting them.\n\nArches, the whole lot of ya.  Listen to Tatsuo.  Don't arbitarily threaten\nhim with banishment. Yes, I know I have suggested banishment myself.\nAnd I still go with that.  If you are not going to Arch him then banish him.\nYou're going to say that you have listened to Tatsuo.  I know you're going\nto say that you've had as much Tatsuo as you can take.  The thing is,\nas many different viewpoints of an event there are, there is only one set of\nfacts.  Someone along the way is lying or seriously mislead in their beliefs.\n\nEveryone.  Please treat each other with respect.  Do not judge without\nhard facts.  Do not launch into mindless attacks on each other.  I can\nhonestly say I haven't said anything to anyone that I would be ashamed\nof having distributed.  I will gladly sit in a room with you all\nand defend everything I've said here.\n\nIf Tatsuo goes, and seeing as Exos is as good as gone, who are we going\nto have left?\n\nI guess I'll start work on master.c now then?\n\nRed\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: redsexy\nFwd:  Tatsuo\nCc: sargon, wilbie, akira, uruz, bobo, shadowmonk, thumper\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nI think what tatsuo says is true.  the mud died because of all the changes\nand being a arch here you have responsibility.  And people who lack the\nresponsibility should be taken off arch immediately.  Once people see\nhow great hm was and what it really was.  I can even say i left hm because\nof lack of work being done and no one gives a damn about the mud but Tatsuo\ncan make a difference.  He made me realized the mud can change.  Therefore\ni have help him with the ninja guild.  He show me many things that can\nbe added to improve hm.  I say why don't we just give tatsuo a try.  \nare you afraid of him??  if so, you can watch him and see his ability\nto work. you will find your suspiouicans are wrong.  This mud will die\nagain and make all the people here lost hope if nothing is being done.\nI have talk to a few people about hm.  they say the arch doesn't care\nabout the mud anymore and at the moment they have saw tatsuo making\nchanges which made people come back.  and actually take a look at this place.\nLet us not neglect hm again.  Give Tatsuo the arch position.\n\nTinman\n\n**\nthumper\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Holy Mission\nCc: tatsuo, sargon\nDate: Mar 22\n\nMangla,\nI see by the files that exos still exists on HM.  I would\nhave thought that after all the complaints that you got that\nthis matter would have been delt with by now.  I would ask why\nyou are dragging your feet on this, but knowing your responses\nin the past I would just get more of the same.  BS from an Arch\nwho does little to punish wrong doings, and lets those who are\ntrying to get this mud up again flounder on thier own.  Tatsuo\nhas done much to get HM standing again and to get new blood\nhere.  Yet you still put off making him an Arch. WHY? Are you\nso insecure that you feel threatened by him.  You have Arches\nhere who are missing half the time, and the other half they\njust wish to be social.  This place needs a heart transplant and \ngetting rid of dead arches who could care less would be a step\nin the right direction.  (You know when I first came to HM it\nwas awsome. Half the time it was so full I had to wait to log in.\nNow , well lets just say there is room to spare. I personally can't\nbelieve this is what you want for a mud where you are an arch.)\nSometimes change is good mangla, it does not need thinking about, \nor committees.  Just DO IT!\nWould you want to be a player here?\nThumper\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: sargon\nSubj: board notes\nDate: Mar 22\n\nYou should be able to already. If not then get me the\npath to the board.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: this arch stuff\nCc: sargon, akira, uruz, tatsuo, bobo, tinman, redsexy, airborne\nDate: Mar 22\n\nLeaving all personal issues aside, and leaving all political bullshit aside,\nI think Tatsuo and the others who have spoken up have some good points.\nWhether that means new arches or just new roles for lower levels, the fact\nremains that we need change.\n\nRight now we have one active arch.  In order to accomplish everything that \nneeds to be done here, that just won't do.  We either need new arches or the\narches need to pass on some roles to the elders.  It's very simple.\n\nThis is not a rip on Airborne, or any other arch.  Actually, let me rephrase\nthat part...  This is not a rip on Airborne, but it IS a rip on the others.\nAirborne still logs in, and he still makes a visible effort.  But the fact\nremains that Mangla is the only arch who plays a primary role in Holy Mission.\nMangla makes the decisions.  Mangla makes the policy.  Airborne acts as sort\nof a check - just to keep things balanced.\n\nAs for the other arches, how in the hell can a person be considered an arch\nwhen they never log on and do anything?  Popping in now and then to vote on\nsomething that you don't even care about doesn't count.\n\nThis is also not a rip on Mangla.  Personally, I have no problem with Mangla.\nThe problem I have is that Mangla (purposely or not) has placed the entire\nMud on his shoulders.  One person just doesn't cut it.  It doesn't matter if\nyou have the best intentions in the world.  One person does not make a mud.\n\nPersonally, I think Tatsuo would make a very good arch.  Quite frankly, I \nthink a great number of the people we have right now would make great arches.\nLet's stop thinking of the \"arch\" position as some elite rank.  It's just \nanother level with more work involved.  If someone has the ability, and the\ndesire, they should be given the opportunity to do the work.  \n\nThey certainly have more business with that rank than someone who never\nlogs in.\n\nOne last thing, for the record.  I don't want to be an arch.  If raising my\nlevel will help me help this mud then yes, I'm all for promotion.  Promote\nme to whatever I can best help you with.  To me, that's all rank is.  It's\naccess to do more good for the Mud.\n\n**\nthumper\n**\nTo: sargon\nFwd:  map\nCc: sargon\nDate: Mar 23\n\nTo: thumper\nSubj: map\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Feb  5\n\n    (enter)\n      |\n      |\n     (hall1)\n      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (chamb1a)\n                            |\n                            |\n                         (chamb1b)\n                            |\n                            |\n                         (chamb1c)\n    (hall2)------------------|\n       |\n\n       |\n       |\n     (dcave1)---------(move boulder)(chamb2a)\n                                       |\n                                       |\n                                       |\n                                     (chamb2b)\n                                       |\n                                       |\n                                       |\n                                     (chamb2c)\n     (hall3)----------------------------|\n        |\n        |\n        |\n      (dcave2)--------(move boulder)(chamb3a)\n                                        |\n                                        |\n                                        |\n                                     (chamb3a)\n                                         |\n\n                                         |\n                                     (chamb3c)\n      (hall4)----------------------------|\n         |\n         |\n         |\n      (dcave3)----------(pull level on wall)\n                        (mob shows up to guard Lord6)\n                        (fight lord6) (if you loose you loose \n                         two levels)\n\n**\nthumper\n**\nTo: sargon\nFwd:  map\nCc: sargon\nDate: Mar 23\n\nTo: thumper\nSubj: map\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Feb  5\n\n    (enter)\n      |\n      |\n     (hall1)\n      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (chamb1a)\n                            |\n                            |\n                         (chamb1b)\n                            |\n                            |\n                         (chamb1c)\n    (hall2)------------------|\n       |\n\n       |\n       |\n     (dcave1)---------(move boulder)(chamb2a)\n                                       |\n                                       |\n                                       |\n                                     (chamb2b)\n                                       |\n                                       |\n                                       |\n                                     (chamb2c)\n     (hall3)----------------------------|\n        |\n        |\n        |\n      (dcave2)--------(move boulder)(chamb3a)\n                                        |\n                                        |\n                                        |\n                                     (chamb3a)\n                                         |\n\n                                         |\n                                     (chamb3c)\n      (hall4)----------------------------|\n         |\n         |\n         |\n      (dcave3)----------(pull level on wall)\n                        (mob shows up to guard Lord6)\n                        (fight lord6) (if you loose you loose \n                         two levels)\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: Strike\nCc: sargon, shadowmonk, nae, bobo, nunu, turbo, tinman, thumper, akira, nylakoorub\nDate: Mar 27\n\nI propose a coding strike, to let the arches know that we are not going to\nput up with their shit anymore.  They have had THREE YEARS to get this mud\nback together, and so far they've failed miserably.  Furthermore, they've\nallowed personal vandettas to hinder the progress of the mud.\n\nI suggest the following conditions to begin coding again:\n\n1.  Reinstate Tatsuo.  That's a given.  He's done more for this mud in a\n    month than all of the arches did in three years.\n\n2.  Demote ALL inactive arches.  Kryll, Magnal, Sauron, Airborne.  These four\n    have done nothing for three years.  Sauron has been \"working on the lib\",\n    Airborne comes in to read boards, and Kryll hasn't done shit.  As for\n    Magnal - who the hell is Magnal?  \n\n3.  Mangla must either step down from arch or promote at\n    LEAST one more arch in order to balance the power.\n\nIf you agree to this, post it.  If not, do whatever you like.  Personally,\nI don't see the point of having the mud if things stay as they are.\n\n\n**\nnae\n**\nTo: wilbie\nRe:   Strike\nCc: redsext, sargon, shadowmonk, nae, bobo, nunu, turbo, tinman, thumper, akira, nylakoorub\nDate: Mar 27\n\njesus christ, this is such crap. \ni'm sorry, i try to stay out of politics, but tatsuo has\nmanaged to brainwash people. so here's the deal, as far\nas i'm concerned.\n\ni'm gonna keep doing what i'm doing. coding, enjoying the\nmud. it's a GAME!!!!!!! i have fun here.\n\nif you want to leave, then be my guest... *shurg* but\na strike???
