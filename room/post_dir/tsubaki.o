Eg. what kind of driver\nare you going to use? If you intend to use Amylaar, will you run in compat or\nnative mode? Also, which files do you want to look at? What info do you\nspecifically need? If you tell me what you want, I'll see what I can do. I\nhave experience of running Amylaar in both compat and native modes, and\nrunning MudOS so there shouldn't be that much I don't know (I hope!).\n\nHope to hear from you soon.\n\nSauron\n\n**\nsmurf\n**\nTo: thorm\nSubj: SCHOOL IS IN!!!\n\nCc: demolian,marco,cara,hootie,kutya,docreason,tsubaki,sipher,gorlin,wa, joyful, dreamer,exos,unuscione\nDate: Aug 26\n\nHI GUYS AND GIRLS!!!!\nI am finally back to school and boy have i missed you all!!!\nMy e mail address hasn't changed....so MAIL ME!!\nS_mlkilgore@vaxa.clarion.edu\nTalk to you all soon!!!!!\n\nLove and miss you all!!!\nSmurf\n(Michelle)\n\n**\nnasus\n**\nTo: tsubaki\nSubj: Hey\n\nDate: Nov  6\n\nHey there..\nI tried to email you..I guess you didn't get it..\nThings are okay with me but also not too good at times, bt\nbut too much to explain in a mail...I'm usually on Archon\n(formerly Fury of the Dragon) 204.118.244.4 3000 instead \nof here...\nWell, I'll talk to you soon..My address is the same at school..\nIf you lost it..it's\n\nSusan Horton\nASU Box 18305\nBoone, NC 28608\nemail:sh21009@appstate.edu\n\nSee ya later,\nSusan\n\n**\nfigleaf\n**\nTo: figleaf\nSubj: The Holy Mission Picture Gallery\n\nCc: airborne, avron, baer, beezlebub, cara, cougar, creed, daniella, demolian, dreamer, eponine, etmol, gorlin, gossamer, helmut, iishima, jewel, joerg, joyful, linsolent, maalth, mickyfin, mikey, misticalla, morrolan, muesli, muzmuz, nemchinov, nylakoorub, relgar, saffrin, schpankay, silas, smeghead, soozie, steerpike, sushi, tas, tegerl, thorm, tiana, tsubaki, unuscione, waldo, widge, zooey\nDate: Nov 11\n\nOk, this is a bulk mailing to all of you that I have pictures for.
