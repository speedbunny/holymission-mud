Basically, I'm not going to be able to have you over during Spring break for several reasons.\nFirst, overwork. I found out now I've got two papers due immediately after, plus I owe some big practice time.  My jury (where I play for the head of the guitar department) is coming up soon, and I can't play my piece worth a damn, much less do I have it memorized.\nAlso, I found out we're going to have to scrounge up an apartment for May first.  The idots we rent from are raising the rent, plus they keep giving us stupid excuses when they give out flase information (like he must have been new, when the guy's worked there at least since May).  So over break is the only time my roommate and I can look together.  Both of have crayz schedules and are never at home at the same time, so it's now or never.  Also, many of the apartments have already been signed, so it's going to be difficult finding something new.\nI've also been down the whole semester, and what I really want is to be alone without scheduled working hours or classes to go to, and just be.  It may sound selfish, but I just don't want to have to deal with hostessing.  I've had some doubts about your coming down to Bloomington and staying with me, ones I should have expressed, but didn't.  Basically I don't like the way it looks, and I think there might be some expectations that I cannot fulfill.  I just want to hibernate.  I'm not up to having a guest around, not even someone I know extremely well, like my sister.  I thought about having her down for a weekend, but decided not to, because I just want time to myself.\nI'm really sorry about this.\nPlease give me a call when you read this...A letter is a shitty way to say these things, but I'd rather do that than have you phone the night before and say, ummm..don't come.\nMary\n\n**\nschpankay\n**\nTo: bobo\nSubj: address, etc.\nDate: Sep  2\n\n3209 East 10th, Apt.

I have layed out many reasons why i want to be arch\nand i am consistantly put off and ignored.  The arches want to do everything behind \nclosed doors.  I am sending this letter to Mangla, who of all the arches, is the\nonly one that codes, and has been here, and who has admittedly pointed out that\nhe forgets things, and misses things, because of everything that needs done.\n\nCoding for HM is something that I enjoy to the fullest, but it has not been fun.\nAt every turn I have an archwizard speaking down at me, lying about me or at\nleast continuing an untrue rumor to others, THIS IS LOGGED, I have sent it to \nmangla.  We have archwizards who last coded 5 years ago.  We have archwizards\nwith outside commitments that take up space here.  We have archwizards that\ntake off 5 months and turn up like messiahs reasserting their rightful positions\nand casting down judgements. And we have one coding arch.\n\nFor 3 and one half years I watched the mud go through death throws, as players\nand wizards were driven off by shitty policies, guild closings, and the mud\nbeing moved around( all reasons I have heard).  Sauron, of the beloved\nninja guild had 3.5 years to recode ninja, he also had 3.5 years to\nput the monk into a bin system, and do something to balance it.  It just wasn't\ndone.  I do not know what he has done, but i can only speak of what wasn't done,\nand ask if opening and fixing these guilds was less important that what was done.\n\nThere was plenty of time for these people to \"shit or get off the pot\".\nIt wasn't done.  For those of you who do not know, or who have prescribed to\nthe rumors that abound.  I was banned by mistake.  I was kept away and put\noff without reason.  Untrustworty was heard. All sorts of things.\nFor the brief time i was unbanned, i was NEVER returned to my position,\nalthough it was a mistake that i lost it.  I was kept and treated as\na wiz with suspicion, and comments being made about me.  It sucked.\n\nI was restored to my position.  Airborne said it was a check on Mangla.\nMangla said it was to bring back HM.  Silas voted for me cause i asked him.\nIn the time that i made elder, I restored the ninja with wilbie, tinman,\nand bobo, restored the summoners with redsexy.  recruited and set up\n7 new Gm's, reviewed and opened 5 areas, coded a clan system, and fixed\n2 whole areas.  There is much more that needs done.  And i log on every\nday to find some social archwizard speaking down from above.  Or active\nones talking down about me or to me.  Telling me what is wrong with me, \nand refusing to listen to all the facts established about what is wrong\nwith what they have done.  I have done archwizard work.  I was an archwizard.\nI have used elder position to help everyone on here, even the assholes.\n\nMany other wizards have been inspired to come back, but that momentum is dying.\nThey have been put off, forgotten, while the ALL important archwizards\nsit back for a month to discuss things.  Redsexy was ignored for a year.\nHer area forgotten.  Bobo has done more coding than any other person\nat his rank, he is ignored and put off.  I don't blame him for cutting back.\nThere are wizards that are banished and wanted to come back, but they are\nignored.  And Exos is still here even after the testimony of 7 or 8 people\nattested to his absolute wrongdoings.\n\nAfter the ninja guild was restored, players and wizards started calling for\nnew archwizards with my name being mentioned many times.  These people were\ntold point blank to shut the hell up.  I have no conception of what\nyou arches have going on in that little room, and what bullshit ideas are\nfloating around.  But face it. One coding arch, isn't going to cut it.\nThe mud blew up in sargons workroom, understandings were reached, Then ignored.\nThat Tuesday came and went a month ago.  The old ways are no longer needed.\nWho is gonna help you put in the 100 level system? Airborne? Silas?\nKryll?, maybe Warlord and Uglymoth.  Maybe Sauron when he comes back from\nhis next extended vacation.  Hello, Tatsuo has the ability, and has shown it.\nThe mantras of me being some evil son of a bitch won't work forever when\nthey are demonstrably untrue.  You know what Redsexy is right, I am BOTH.\n\nI cannot fathom the resistance to the move when everything points to a positive.\nWhen there is a chance to remove the dead weight and move up the people\nthat are bringing back the players.  The momentum as you put it is starting to slip\nwith the players.  I can spark it back up.  I will claim responsibility\nfor a large percent of the comeback that is started.  I give the rest to the\npeople who have been ignored and put off.  From what i know, there are\npotentially 3 mudlib level coders on the game besides you Mangla.\nThose are your archwizards.\nTatsuo, Wilbie, and Sargon.\n\nPlease stop bogarting the highest position in the game when others can fill \nthose positions.  calling kryll to login hasn't made him come back and fix the\nplace. and saurons instant appearance also has done little but piss me off.\nPut the level where the level belongs.  With the people that code this place,\nand enjoy it.\n\nYou want the 100 level system in, arch those people.\nYou want the guilds running and balanced, arch those people.\nYou want players coming back, arch those people.\nYou want new players, arch those people.\nYou want wizards coding and being helped with code, arch those people.\nYou want Holy Mission back, arch those people.\n\nIf you want things the way they were. Sit back and dicuss things some more with\nthe deadbeats that brought her down.\nMake some changes, shake the boat. Take action, make it fun.\nIf not, I am outta here.  \n\nI have forwarded this to every wiz that gives a damn, and i will ask that\nthese wizzes write their feelings to MANGLA and cc it to TATSUO.  I want\na clean and open debate.  I also ask that it not be sent to other arches\nwhose feelings may be hurt by it.  That is not my intention.  I i have\nspoken an untruth, let it be known.  If i am right, tell mangla to fix the\nplace.\n\nTatsuo, for Holy Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: Strike\nCc: sargon, shadowmonk, nae, bobo, nunu, turbo, tinman, thumper, akira, nylakoorub\nDate: Mar 27\n\nI propose a coding strike, to let the arches know that we are not going to\nput up with their shit anymore.  They have had THREE YEARS to get this mud\nback together, and so far they've failed miserably.  Furthermore, they've\nallowed personal vandettas to hinder the progress of the mud.\n\nI suggest the following conditions to begin coding again:\n\n1.  Reinstate Tatsuo.  That's a given.  He's done more for this mud in a\n    month than all of the arches did in three years.\n\n2.  Demote ALL inactive arches.  Kryll, Magnal, Sauron, Airborne.  These four\n    have done nothing for three years.  Sauron has been \"working on the lib\",\n    Airborne comes in to read boards, and Kryll hasn't done shit.  As for\n    Magnal - who the hell is Magnal?  \n\n3.  Mangla must either step down from arch or promote at\n    LEAST one more arch in order to balance the power.\n\nIf you agree to this, post it.  If not, do whatever you like.  Personally,\nI don't see the point of having the mud if things stay as they are.\n\n\n**\nnae\n**\nTo: wilbie\nRe:   Strike\nCc: redsext, sargon, shadowmonk, nae, bobo, nunu, turbo, tinman, thumper, akira, nylakoorub\nDate: Mar 27\n\njesus christ, this is such crap. \ni'm sorry, i try to stay out of politics, but tatsuo has\nmanaged to brainwash people. so here's the deal, as far\nas i'm concerned.\n\ni'm gonna keep doing what i'm doing. coding, enjoying the\nmud. it's a GAME!!!!!!! i have fun here.\n\nif you want to leave, then be my guest... *shurg* but\na strike??? WHO FUCKING CARES????\n\njesus, maybe i shouldnt mail when i'm drunk. but this is just\nsuch crap... whining about shit that tatsuo obviously has no clue about.\n\nwilbie, and whoever else supports this strike... i have a suggestion for\nya- go on strike. turn off your machine, get out into the world,\nand realize that there's more to it than this game. cause\nthis game doesnt mean a damn thing.\n\nnae\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: akira\nSubj: strike\nCc: nae, turbo, bobo, nunu, redsexy\nDate: Mar 29\n\nThe whole point of the strike was not to stop the mud.  The point was to\nshow the arches that we're united.  But I guess we're not.  I guess only a\nfew of us give a rat's ass that the mud is falling apart.\n\nNae - I agree, this is only a game.  It's supposed to be a fun game.  But \nI'll tell you what Nae...  After you've spent the time coding hundreds of\nrooms, items, and monsters, and after you've spend the time testing and \nrecoding a few guilds - only to have it mean NOTHING because a couple \narchwizards decide to play dictator - you tell me you're not a little \npissed about it.  You listen to three years of bullshit and tell me you're\nnot frustrated.  \n\nAt the very least, I would have at least expected a litte consideration from\nyou.  I thought we were friends - my mistake.\n\nAs for the rest of you, I'll say it again.  It's your mud...  if you want it,\nyou've gotta take it.\n\nThere's a good chance that I'll be banished soon - it's how our arches deal\nwith us \"subversive\" types.  If I am, have a good one.  I hope the best for\nHoly Mission and for all of you.  \n\nWilbie\ncphite@lightstream.net\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: turbo\nSubj: stuff\nCc: bobo, akira, redsexy, tuppence, nunu\nDate: Mar 29\n\nIf anyone wants to keep in touch, please send me an email\nat the following:\n\ncphite@lightstream.net\n\nInclude your ICQ number and nickname if you have one (if you don't have\nICQ you should get it - you'll like it)...\n\nThanks.\n\n**\nnae\n**\nTo: wilbie\nRe:   strike\nCc: nae, turbo, bobo, nunu, redsexy, akira\nDate: Mar 30\n\nYes, we ARE friends. But I'm sorry, I'm not a sheep.\n*I* don't agree with you that the arches are dictators.\n*I* dont agree that they're ruining the mud.\nI happen to think that the best way we can make the\nmud better is to all work together... which is CLEARLY\nnot what you were asking for.\n\nI'm sorry. If you open a discussion, and call for\nresponses, dont act like it's the end of the world\nwhen they dont agree with you.\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: sargon\nSubj: Promotions\nCc: arches, tinman, shadowmonk, brainsprain, redsexy, bobo, turbo\nDate: Mar 31\n\nAs was promised, the promotions have been made.\nThanks for your time and patience.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\n"
