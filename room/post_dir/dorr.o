So he got removed for his opinion.\n\nThere is more to it, but that is the general gist.\n>>>>>Axlrose - ...<<<<<\n\n**\nhaplo\n**\nTo: dorr\nSubj: Hello\nDate: Apr 28\n\nPlease don't take this as an insult, I am still working to perfect my German\nhowever, I read your note on the ninja board and just though I would pass along\na little bit of advice. The word wear when changed to past tense is worn not \nweared. Weared is not really a proper conjugation (word change) Also when you \nuse a plural such as knives \"was\" should be \"were\" example: The knives were \nworn by the ninjas. \nThe only other thing is women is plural and does not need an \"s\" added at the\nend. Woman is singular meaning 1 adult female and \"women\" applies to more than\n1 adult female.\n\n   Again I am not trying to insult just thought you might like to know. I have\nto say your English is much better than my German. Well hope this mail has \nhelped.\n\n   Haplo\n\n**\n"
