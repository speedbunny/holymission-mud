A few guys were releasing latin sayings through the\nchat line. just because it sounded good, maybe they didn't even know what they meant. then figleaf comes: chat line is english only.\nyou know, this rule has gone a little too far. many people here are not\nnative english, and i myself don't get harrassed if someone speaks a language that i don't understand, but i'll try to understand that others do.\nhowever, what happened today is that after figleaf came with english\nonly, others including myself started to say things through the line. like \"argelbargel kalahu\", which means nothing.\nfigleaf then jailed 2 of us. jailed me after my question: wo ist das Jail?\nsomething is wrong here. i get the rules, but it's an abuse of power. we\ndon't come here to play in a police state.\n\nnot to mention another case: i was talking to a good friend in hungarian.\nthen i realized that someone was standing on our square. i saw stiletto was on.\nso we rushed to the church (we don't have a house). and continued there.\nthen stiletto complained to exos that we speak a \"foreign language\" in a \npublic room. exos came and forbade us. all of this is going too far.\n\ni speak 4 languages, and i feel that i have the right to speak any of\nthem whenever i want to. if many are bugged by it, ok, i won't, but it\nshouldn't go beyond rational measures. I'm not sure about the solution.\nIt would be great for instance to have a twin brother of the chat line\nthat is international (that's easy to code, I guess).\nIn short, this disorganized letter is asking you to do something about the problem.\nI ask you as someone I find most cooperative and rational.\nI represent the opinion of several people.\n\nRegards:\nCigaretta\n\n**\n"
