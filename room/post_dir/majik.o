I just got back from the post office and I mailed that letter and picture\noff to you, so it'll be at your house by like Wed. or Thurs. \njust thought I'd give you something to look forward too!!\n\nLuv,\nRin\n\n**\nbobo\n**\nTo: majik\nSubj: note\nDate: Feb 27\n\nI saw your note on the thief board and thought that I'd respond to you\nvia mail because it seemed better to do it that way.  First, about clans\nthere are currently two functional clans, with at three that I know of\nbeing coded now...If you would like to check out the clan that I have \ncoded then feel free to catch me when we are both online, I'll let you \nlook at it and then you can decide whether you want to be a part of that\nclan.  Second, areas...I am currently working on a really large area with\nmonsters that vary in level from 3 up to something that your average high\nlegend level character would think about killing...I coded a small area\nthat is being checked for errors as we speak, but the main thing that I \nwanted to say/ask about was what areas are you speaking of that are bugged?\nIf you are talking about mortal kombat area, no chance, it's gone, but if\nyou have other areas in mind, let me know cuz I wouldn't mind looking at\nit...In fact any general improvements that you think that the mud could use\nplease mail me, and if I can't work on it I'll at least pass it along...\n\nBobo\n\n**\n"
