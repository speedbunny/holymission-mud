Try 'judge gabrel'.\nCure: the usage (as stated in the help file) is 'cast cure >option>'\n      where <option> is one of wounds, poison or alcohol.\nParry: the usage (as stated in the help file) is 'cast parry'.\n\nHope this helps... In general, look at the first line of each help file,\nwhere it says 'USAGE: blah'.\n\nSauron\n\n**\n"
