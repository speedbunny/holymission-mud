I wanted to make this request of all \nof you.  I am sorry if i could not included everyone as I brought up\nmost of your names from memory.\n      I was removed banished because Herp was told on the wizline \nby Leslie that It was me who had altered his prison file.\nLeslie said this because i was mentioning the abuse of the\nprison file earlier that day.  I have made almost no attempt\nto reinstate my self in the last few months but I am coming\nto the point where I really miss being here and talking with most\nof you.  When I was here I made a difference.  I want to do so again\nMy life has settled down and I am no longer in transition.  I hold\nthe postion of General Manager and Partner of Hawk Manufactured Housing\nbased in Warren PA and have recently opened the 5th Sanchin Karate Academy \nthere.  But anyway.\nI have sent mail to Herp explaning everything that transpired and trying\nto clear up the whole mess.  I need support.\nI would like to ask each and every one of you to mail a short message\nto Herp.  Say what you can.  If only that you believe what happened \nwas a mistake and you would like to see Tatsuo unbanished.\nI am counting on each one of you.  I hthink I have helped each one \nof you over the years and I REALLY WANT TO COME BACK.\nplease drop me a mail if you sent something so i can keep track.\nThank You,\n         David Grant Goodman, AKA Tatsuo\n           814-226-7228\n\n**\namethyst\n**\nTo: gandalf\nSubj: do you own winds?\n\nDate: Jul 28\n\nif so when are you going back to akron\nand Simon needs help with luinx\ner liunx\nmail me back please\nthanx\nNemchinov\n((\n\n**\n"
