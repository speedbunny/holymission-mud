I have not had a break.\nKryll is looking at your area and says you still have the monsters\nall named the same thing. He will have a rep file for you by tomorrow\nafternoon. Do not be so glum, we are all only human. (Except for\nus aliens hiding in humans bodies, but no more mention of that.)\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nkairon\n**\nTo: cashimor\nSubj: The tag\n\nDate: Jul 19\n\nThought I'd tell you---When first logging in, the tag resets the compare \nvalue to -0-, instead of resetting to the current XP value of the bearer.\nThis doesn't seem quite right...\n\nThanks,\n\n         Kairon\n\n**\nexos\n**\nTo: cashimor\n Re:   The tag\nDate: Jul 24\n\nI never changed the tag, so it should still be yours.\nNot sure how to find out which tag Kairon is using,\nbut check the tags any other player is using, I believe they\nare all yours.\n\nI'll look into it, if I find anything out, I'll let you know.\n\nExos\n\n**\nkairon\n**\nTo: cashimor\n Re:   The tag\nDate: Jul 25\n\nCashimor---\n\nThanks.  I've also noticed that after login, the reset command followed by\nthe compare command must be issued in order to get the tag to compare prop-\nerly.  If `rst' is issued, then something killed, `cmp' then shows the total\nexperience points of the player instead of the gained experience points.\n\nNow that I understand this, it's much easier for me to use the tag.  I do\nbelieve, however, that resetting the compare value to current XP instead of\n0 at login would be beneficial.\n\nThanks again,\n\n        Kairon\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: cashimor\n Re:   Experience/levels\nDate: Aug  1\n\nWell, to try and answer your questions, the exp tables in the guild master\nwill be obsolete, but I think that the new funs I've added to player.c will\ndo the job you want.\n\n1. query_min_exp_for_level() - this returns the minimum exp a player should\n                               have for their current level.\n\n2. query_exp_for_next_level() - this returns the exp required for the next\n                                level.\n\n3. query_exp_to-advance() - this returns the actual amount of exp that the\n                            player needs to advance (ie the target exp minus\n                            the current exp). hence 0 means that they are\n                            ready to advance\n\n4. query_perc_exp_to_advance() - this does the same as the last fun, except\n                                 it converts the value into a percentage.\n\n5. calculate_exp_for_level() - pass this a level and it will return the\n                               amount of exp required for that level - I\n                               can add guild dependent factors into the fun\n                               if need be.\n\n\nLet me know if these don't cover what you want for the tag and I'll see\nwhat I can do.\n\nDave\n\n**\nquasimodo\n**\nTo: cashimor\nRe:   Bug report\nDate: Apr 20\n\nIt was at the eastern room on the main village road. There is a diggable sand\nIn the sand I was at the bottom of shaft and did 'dig south'. The message\nI reported appears - just after them I went up from the hole afraid of game\ncrash.
