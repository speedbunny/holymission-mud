Passwd sharing is strictly forbidden here, and as more\npeople find out the more likely you and Alexia will be punished for it.\nWhen its so simple to create a new character, I don't see\nwhy you would choose any other path.\n\nArborne\n\n**\nwednesday\n**\nTo: alexia\nSubj: ho ho \n\nDate: Jan 30\n\nyou call me\nlove mackenzie\n\n**\nwednesday\n**\nTo: alexia\nSubj: hoho\n\nDate: Feb  4\n\nlisten spud.  stop sending mail from here silly.  petey might get confuse\nd or something.  *KOOLAID GRIN*\n\nall u?....for WHAT pray tell?.....\nlisten spud....i just may need to put you out of your miserable suffering\nand bake u ...\nwuv u.\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: alexia\n Re:   pease\nDate: Feb  6\n\nCome visit!\n\nFriday night is UFC on Pay per View!

As for \nhaving more than 2 players, Tiana/Alexia/Kayla needs to select\none to be deleted.\n\nThe events of playing more than one at a time over the last week can\nnot occur again.\n\nSAff\n\n**\n"
