Have fun in New Zealand.  send me a pic of you plllluuueeezzz.\n\n**\nperaphon\n**\nTo: relgar\nSubj: Joke (::NETHED:: only)\n\nCc: tuppence figleaf kryten\nDate: Nov 26\n\nQ: How do you teach math to a blonde?\n\nA: Subtract the clothes\n   Divide the legs\n   Give her a square root\n   then see if she multiplies.\n\n=)\n\nPete\n\n**\nperaphon\n**\nTo: relgar\n Re:   Seafarer's indiscretion\nCc: tuppence kryten izekiel\nDate: Dec  4\n\nOk, so Kryten will bring Seafarer around to the correct way of thinking \non the title subject. Sounds cool to me.\n\nRegarding Figleaf, I think we'd better ask him if he still wants to be \ninvolved as ::NETHED::'s token wiz member (since our other token wiz \nwent back to being a player :) I think that democracy should rule if a\ndecision can't be made.\n\nBattle tactics: Seafarer's ability to parry could be a pain, which is why\nit's a shame that Figgy wizzed. We could have done with an L7 mage in\ndealing with her should the need arise. If Kryten can hold her to stop \nthe parry, all good and well. Maybe we can con some mitras out of Figgy \nfor such a battle :)\n\nWELCOME IZEKIEL!! It's good to have ya on board, man :) What sort of slice \ndid _he_ get? Something nice and gruesome? I would have liked to see him\nchow down on a nice slice of maggot. Jeremy being the chef type should be\nable to make a banquet out of it, poached in a white wine sauce or something\nlike that. :>\n\nSee y'all later.\nPete.\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: kryten\n Re:   address\nDate: Dec 24\n\nUmm, a last name would make the card easier to get to you silly.\n\nCindi\n\n**\nrelgar\n**\nTo: relgar\nSubj: ::NETHED::\n\nCc: peraphon tuppence kryten izekiel\nDate: Apr  4\n\nAll of y'all still here?

I know that\nsome of you, including myself, don't find Exos all that agreeable. Frankly,\nI could write the code and give it to a wiz to input for us but then they\nwould just be a coding monkey and wouldn't really have any meaning for bein'\nour immortal member. I think Figleaf would be a good nomination for it for\nseveral reasons, one he's one of the Sheriff's on the place and if we're\ngonna be pking it'd be nice to have him on our side, 2 he was once a member\nof ::NETHED:: so we know he is down with the program, 3 he's a nice guy and\na good coder. well I guess that would be 4 too. That'd be my nomination for\nour immortal member, I don't know if he would do it because he IS the rules\nsheriff for the place but we can give it a shot. If y'all have any other \nnominations, this isn't a dictatorship, we can vote on who we want to ask.\nGuarantee I will veto any request for Exos though >:) That's news from\nyour fearless leader. Lemme know what y'all think.\n\nRelgar, a.k.a.

I have given some thought to the question\nyou put to me at our last discussion. Through much research and inquiry\nof some of the worlds top scientists it has become clear to me that the\nanswer to your question is in the negative.

Also if we have a problem with a pker etc you can't legally bring\non more than one person so it would be useless to have more than one char in.\n\nRelgar. :)\n\n**\nperaphon\n**\nTo: relgar\nSubj: New member\n\nCc: tuppence figleaf kryten izekiel tetsuhara manfred tas quazar tinkerbell\nDate: Aug  9\n\nI have the pleasure of announcing a new member, inducted a \ncouple of days ago by yours truly.\n\nThe member is....
