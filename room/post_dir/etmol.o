I mean I haven't seen\n]you for months, I'm idle and suddenly I see that you start telling\n]me you're NOT KIDDING and all that shit (capital fucking letters\n]are yours). I'm sorry if this shit is your greatest concern, but\n]that should be your problem. Leave me alone, don't talk to me like\n]to a criminal and don't threaten me and all that please. I will\n]not initiate any contact as you could see I haven't because all\nmy attepmts to talk to you have failed and it was not my\nfault they failed, you simply didn't listen. You and I see the\nworld very differently and you often don't seem to be very \ntolerant of the way I do things or things I say. That should not\nbe a problem but you have a certain authority and power which\nyou have misused in the past because you have followed your own\nway of thinking and judgement. \nNext time please at least count to ten before you start talking to\nme.\n\n\n                                                    E.\n\n**\netmol\n**\nTo: saffrin\nSubj: .\nCc: etmol\nDate: Apr 28\n\n\n\nHmm, I reread that. Looks like I was a little upset.\nJust a little. Sorry for a few words, you know which ones.\n\n\n                                                   E.\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: etmol\nSubj: simple values\nCc: saffrin\nDate: Apr 28\n\nIt is a matter of simple values.  You accepted, by becoming a wizard, to uphold\nthe rules of this MUD.  It is not a matter of how we view the world.\nIf that is the case, then I am inclined to believe that you view the world\nas a place to cheat to gain what you want from life.  Maybe I am naive to\nbelieve that everyone will do what is right.  You once told me that\nyou had both on because it was a test on the system.  The simple factr\nis there is no excuse for not following the guidelines you agreed to.\n\nI have never misused the powers that I had when I was sheriff.  You only\nneed to ask any arch that.  To say such is a personal attack on me and my \nmorals but then again, coming from someone who has such a blatant \ndisregard for rules, I guess I should not be so offended.  The only\nones ever to accuse me of abusing the power were those who I caught\ncheating and they could not get out of it.\n\nI follow the rules and guidelines I agreed to follow when I wizzed on here.\nThere is no \"your own way of thinking\" when it comes to the rules that\nhave been laid down.\n\nS.\n\n**\netmol\n**\nTo: saffrin\nSubj: .\nCc: etmol\nDate: Apr 28\n\n\nThank for your letter, I'm glad you finally talked to me.\nI really am.\nWhy don't we talk once we're both here.\n\n**\netmol\n**\nTo: sauron\nSubj: .\nCc: mangla, etmol\nDate: Apr 29\n\n\nOk, here's the story. Evil killed me way back in the church with \na panther twice in a row. I told him I'd kill him for that once,\nand we actually had a nice conversation about the concepts of \nroleplaying and how this was what he has to do. I wizzed since\nand when I saw him with my player character today I remembered\nand killed him. THat was probably not a good idea.. :)\nAnyway, he came in to my house with his wizard then and starting\nspitting and all that so I came in to talk to him and went netdead\nwith my player. I later told him I was sorry several times but\nhe appeared very very very upset which is strange considering\nwhat I remember from our conversation... and that he was level 6\nnow. I told him I didn't know it meant so much to him and that\nwe could group up and I'd help him regain the lost xp but\nhe didn't seem to want to talk or listen just told me he'd kill\nme, and everyone from Hungary as a revenge. This lasted a long\ntime, me apologising, he telling me only this. Please talk\nto him if you can and in the meantime decide whether my kill was\njustified or not.\n\n\n                                           E.\n\n**\nvolkswagen\n**\nTo: etmol\nSubj: nem tudok bemenni a wiz. guildbe. vagy vigyel be, vagy...ne\nDate: Apr 29\n\nde.\n\negy magyar a 3. vilagbol\n\n**\nvolkswagen\n**\nTo: etmol\nSubj: vagy lehetoseg az is, hogy megyek, tenyuleg eleg sok dogom van, te meg kuldd el oket email\nDate: Apr 29\n\n\n**\nschpankay\n**\nTo: etmol\nSubj: my number\nDate: Apr  2\n\n01.47.07.02.74\n\nciao dearie!\nMary\n\n**\netmol\n**\nTo: schpankay\nRe:   my number\nCc: etmol\nDate: Apr  9\n\nMary dearest,\n\n(Un)fortunately I reached my plane just in time,\nit was funny, since daylight saving time started\nin Europe the day I was flying, causing a little\nconfusion in my tired head, anyway, I didn't have\ntime to call you.
