Everyone knows that you intended to bring Pyro on just to kill\nStiletto. You may not have gone looking for him today, but who's to know\nthat you didn't bring Pyro on for the same reason?\n\nThis is what happens when you threaten to kill someone. People who don't \nlike your threats go after you. Learn not to make the threats in the \nfirst place yur chances of people going after you are slim.\n\nDon't demand that someone else be banished. Stiletto will be dealt with in\nthe manor that is seen fit. \n\nAirborne\n\n**\nperaphon\n**\nTo: pyro\n Re:   ::NETHED::\nDate: May  5\n\nI'll think about it\n\n**\nlynne\n**\nTo: pyro\nSubj: hi\nDate: Oct  8\n\nAs soon as we are both on together again we'll get engaged. \nAnd as for who I am- a crazy pyschopath from NY :)  \ndont beleive me ask peraphon.\ntalk to you soon\nLynne\n\n**\nlynne\n**\nTo: pyro\nSubj: nothing\nDate: Oct 22\n\nHey there, how are you?
