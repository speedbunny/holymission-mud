I don't believe\nwhat happened yesterday morning.  I couldn't even decipher the messages I was\nsending to you or you to me, apparently it was to do with the storm and line\ninterference  Oh well.\n\nI love ya loads, and once this job interview is over (on Friday) who knows,\nmaybe I can make some solid plans to come out and visit you.  Getting the\nrl boyfriend out of the way could be a problem, but even if we just get\nan hour together, it would be worth a lifetime to me.\n\nI miss you soooo much... *sigh*, you and your humour and your love.\n\nI hope we can talk tonight, just hang out together, but who knows what this\nlife will throw in my direction next.\n\nAll my love, I love you Tristan...\n\nSarah\n\n**\n"
