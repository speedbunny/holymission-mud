I gues I feel bad\nabout some things...I'm sorry for\nthe last few weeks. I know its\nbeen hard.  I wish I could\nmake it better.  I'm hurting inside\nand i'm sure you are too\n...\n\ndont forget me,\nshel\n\n**\napocalypse\n**\nTo: misticalla\nSubj: hiya\n\nDate: Sep 23\n\nHows things going with you? Hope they are well.\nHavent talked to you in ages.\nPlease dont let linsolent or anybody else get to you because of me\nThere was a sexual harrasment case taken against me recently as I have\nprobably told you in the past. People have tried to use this against me\na lot recently and I was copping a lot of flak over it. There was an attempt\nto link it to things that have happened in the past by some people.\nTuesday last week I was told of the universities official position on the\ncase against me. The final finding was that the seven pages of complaints\nagainst me were unfounded and that the sexual harrasment case was an\nimproper forum for the claims because there was nothing sexual about them.\nI would also like to add that the panel that arrived at these results\nwas almost entirely female and had a strong feminist stance. I will be\ntaking my own action against several people on this campus over what was\nbasically a slag campaign and has totally fucked up several months of my\nlife. I really dont want to see other people getting attacked for sticking\nup for me. Those people are basically a bunch of deadhead fuckwits which\nthe world would definately be better off without.\nAs an important point warmaster is not gone. I asked for his name to be \nchanged because of some of the shit that was going round and someone\nobliged me. I dont know how legal that was but warmaster is now gizmo.\nThis is only known by 3 people at the moment (including yourself) and\nI hope to keep it that way.\nI tried emailing you earlier on but our server is fucked and it bounced.\nWe are looking at setting up a mud here soon. There is currently no\nplans for how it will run or what sort of game it will be etc. I must\nalso add that we haven't even got permission yet although going on\ntalking to the people in the computing center there should be no problems\nwith that. I was wondering if you would be at all interested in helping\nus setup the thing and if you had any ideas for a game. If you are\ninterested then email me at arco@blitzen.canberra.edu.au .I would like\nto have you in with us because I know you wont fuckup or screw around.\nIts being blunt but its true :) . Too many of the people I see on here\nand other games just fuck around. I'll keep you in touch with what has\nbeen decided and how things are going. I have a large say in what\nhappens though because the machine it will be running on is one I own.\n\nHope things are going well for you in real life as opposed to mud life\nwhere there seems to be a lot going on that I dont know about that isn't\nreal nice. I hope your ok and not stressing about things too much\n\nTake care of yourself Shell\n\n\nPaul\n\n**\nwarlord\n**\nTo: misticalla\nSubj: Mud marry\nDate: Jun 30\n\nWanna get mud married?\n\n**\nbladecutter\n**\nTo: misticalla\nSubj: heya back\nDate: Sep 24\n\nSomehow, my connection got severed, so if ya got the first messaage, \nthis is going to seem repetative...\nHowever, if this doesn't look familiar, ignore the above two lines...\n\nDon't worry about missing my birthday... Being 24 sucks... Suggestion:\nDon't turn 24!!\n\nSecond, How can ya have a heart attack about me having an accisent, \nwhen I haven't even told you about it yet?\nMakes me wonder how ya found out...  I guess I'm calling people\nin my sleep again... Would explain my phone bill, though :)\n\nBut anyway, yeah, some lady decided to rear end my bike at 1am while i was on my way home from work back in May...\nOther than being broke, and having a sore back, I'm fine...\nAnd so is the bike :)\n\nSo other than being broke (which is nothing new), and having a sore back \n(which also isn't anything new, either), I'm actually doing fine, which,\nif ya've been watching carefully fer the past couple years, is something\nnew :)\n\n Kinda sucks that i hafta get runover by a car, and put into a coma\nbefore things start turning fine though, don'tcha think?\n\n Besides, i figured if anyone was gonna run me over, it prolly would\nhave atleast been one of you ladies from on here... After all i've put\nyou girls through, i think i deserve it :)\n\nAnyway, I'm outta here...\n\nOpps, almost forgot...\n\nHow would i tell ya if yer not even on, anyway?\nNot like I coulda called ya while I was laying in the hospital unconcious, anyway\n\nJust being myself,\n\nIan.\n\n**\nmisticalla\n**\nTo: bladecutter\nRe:   heya back\nCc: misticalla\nDate: Sep 25\n\nYeah, I know, you cant call or email while in a coma -\nbut Tuppy did tell me about you only a few days ago when i asked her if\nshe'd seen/heard from you.\n\nI'm glad you're okay and I'm glad\nthat you seem to be doing better (in all aspects\nof life, etc.\n\nThings are good here.  I am on ocasionally, but not as much as the days i had no life.\n\nDont ask me how but that came out wrong.\nI lvoe typing messages when i cant see the words.  My telnet screen sucks.\n\nThanks for lettin me know you're alive.  I miss you.\n\nTake care hon,\nShelley\n\n**\nbladecutter\n**\nTo: misticalla\nRe:   heya back\nDate: Sep 26\n\nAhh, you've always had a life, you just din't realize it back then.\nBut I do understand yer life now starting to get a bit overwhelming...\nHusbands, ya just have to keep your eyes on them at all times, \ndon't ya? Otherwise they can get into so much trouble :)\n\nHeck, if ya think he's a handful, wait until you have yer first kid :)\nRemember all those times when your mom told you that she hopes you have\nkids just as rotten (if not worse) than you were to her?\nGuess what... It always comes true...\nHence the reason why Grandparents always spoil them rotten :)\nYet another way to get even... Not fair, is it? :)\n\nSo what have you actually been up to lately? And how can you find the\ntime to miss someone as un-memorable as I am?\nSometimes, I wake up, and can't remember who I am... :)\nWorst part is what happens after I do remember who I actually am...\n(the constant stream of curses that ensue probably would upset a \nhardened bar-fighter...)\n\nAnyway, only thing I've really been up to lately is trying to catch back\nup with life, and again I'm stuck with a female problem that\nI don't know how to cope with...\n\nBut that's a whole different story for a whole different note...\n\nAnd I hafta run right now...\n\nTalk to ya later, I hope :)\n\nIan (a.k.a. :Jack, Brent (who you never liked :) ), Bladecutter, and \nmany others, both past and present...)\n\n**\nbladecutter\n**\nTo: misticalla\nSubj: Heya\nDate: Oct 31\n\n  Guess what I did back on Oct 1st...\nI wrecked my bike and got shipped off to the hospital with a broken hip.\nA lady in her Black Acura pulled out in front of me, and i hit her car\njust infront of her drivers door.\nSo I've been out of action for a while, and will stay this way \nfor a little while longer...\n\nTalk to ya later,\n   Ian.\n\n**\nbladecutter\n**\nTo: misticalla\nSubj: Going home\nDate: Nov 28\n\nHeya Shells...\n\n   Guess what?  This screwed up hip has taken its toll on my body, \nand the lack of working has taken its toll on my wallet.  So I'm once\nagain going to live in Canada with my parents\n   Life just seems to be one big circle, doesn't it?\n   But this time i'm going to bring my computer with me, so i shouldn't\nvanish off the face of the earth this time for six months.\n   How long am I going to stay in Canada?  Who knows...  I've broken\ndown pretty good this time, and don't know if i will return to the states.\nI hope only for a year, when the legal mess is solved, signed, and the money \npaid out.  Atleast I won't have to worry about money for a while.\n   I'd get to replace my bike with a nice, shiny new one, and if there's\nenough money left over, i'll buy a truck, too.\n   Anyway, thought i'd let ya know i'm moving back to my old adress and \nphone number up in Canada.  The phone number i can give you, don't remember the \naddress off hand... (506) 832-4519.\n\n  Talk to ya later \n  Ian.\n\n**\n"
