I think I want to focus more on coding my area.\nLemme know, 'casue I said I would help, and will not go back on my word.\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: darastor\nSubj: guild\nDate: Mar 24\n\nNeither did I.\n\n**\nnae\n**\nTo: darastor\nFwd:  Strike\nDate: Mar 27\n\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: Strike\nCc: sargon, shadowmonk, nae, bobo, nunu, turbo, tinman, thumper, akira, nylakoorub\nDate: Mar 27\n\nI propose a coding strike, to let the arches know that we are not going to\nput up with their shit anymore.  They have had THREE YEARS to get this mud\nback together, and so far they've failed miserably.  Furthermore, they've\nallowed personal vandettas to hinder the progress of the mud.\n\nI suggest the following conditions to begin coding again:\n\n1.  Reinstate Tatsuo.  That's a given.  He's done more for this mud in a\n    month than all of the arches did in three years.\n\n2.  Demote ALL inactive arches.  Kryll, Magnal, Sauron, Airborne.  These four\n    have done nothing for three years.  Sauron has been \"working on the lib\",\n    Airborne comes in to read boards, and Kryll hasn't done shit.  As for\n    Magnal - who the hell is Magnal?  \n\n3.  Mangla must either step down from arch or promote at\n    LEAST one more arch in order to balance the power.\n\nIf you agree to this, post it.  If not, do whatever you like.  Personally,\nI don't see the point of having the mud if things stay as they are.\n\n\n**\nnae\n**\nTo: mangla\nFwd:  Strike\nCc: darastor\nDate: Mar 27\n\nTo: wilbie\nRe:   Strike\nCc: redsext, sargon, shadowmonk, nae, bobo, nunu, turbo, tinman, thumper, akira, nylakoorub\nDate: Mar 27\n\njesus christ, this is such crap. \ni'm sorry, i try to stay out of politics, but tatsuo has\nmanaged to brainwash people. so here's the deal, as far\nas i'm concerned.\n\ni'm gonna keep doing what i'm doing. coding, enjoying the\nmud. it's a GAME!!!!!!! i have fun here.\n\nif you want to leave, then be my guest... *shurg* but\na strike??? WHO FUCKING CARES????\n\njesus, maybe i shouldnt mail when i'm drunk. but this is just\nsuch crap... whining about shit that tatsuo obviously has no clue about.\n\nwilbie, and whoever else supports this strike... i have a suggestion for\nya- go on strike. turn off your machine, get out into the world,\nand realize that there's more to it than this game. cause\nthis game doesnt mean a damn thing.\n\nnae\n\n**\nnae\n**\nTo: darastor\nFwd:   What your Month!\nDate: Mar 28\n\nTo: nae\nSubj:  What your Month!\nDate: Mar 27\n\nHey, Nae...
