Although I have\nnot played for several years, I noticed my character file still exists\nI have no idea what my password could have been, but it would be kind\n.  If you would check to be sure it is in fact\nthe same character (high level troll fighter created back in '92 (or\nsometime around then)) and mail me my password, I would be most \nappreciative.\n\n      E-mail address (formerly thadd@ksu.ksu.edu)  now -- treplogl@mesastate.edu\n\n\n                             Thanks,\n                              Thadd\n.\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: airborne\nSubj: list\nDate: Mar  9\n\nNot a very long list, I'm afraid.

I have layed out many reasons why i want to be arch\nand i am consistantly put off and ignored.  The arches want to do everything behind \nclosed doors.  I am sending this letter to Mangla, who of all the arches, is the\nonly one that codes, and has been here, and who has admittedly pointed out that\nhe forgets things, and misses things, because of everything that needs done.\n\nCoding for HM is something that I enjoy to the fullest, but it has not been fun.\nAt every turn I have an archwizard speaking down at me, lying about me or at\nleast continuing an untrue rumor to others, THIS IS LOGGED, I have sent it to \nmangla.  We have archwizards who last coded 5 years ago.  We have archwizards\nwith outside commitments that take up space here.  We have archwizards that\ntake off 5 months and turn up like messiahs reasserting their rightful positions\nand casting down judgements. And we have one coding arch.\n\nFor 3 and one half years I watched the mud go through death throws, as players\nand wizards were driven off by shitty policies, guild closings, and the mud\nbeing moved around( all reasons I have heard).  Sauron, of the beloved\nninja guild had 3.5 years to recode ninja, he also had 3.5 years to\nput the monk into a bin system, and do something to balance it.  It just wasn't\ndone.  I do not know what he has done, but i can only speak of what wasn't done,\nand ask if opening and fixing these guilds was less important that what was done.\n\nThere was plenty of time for these people to \"shit or get off the pot\".\nIt wasn't done.  For those of you who do not know, or who have prescribed to\nthe rumors that abound.  I was banned by mistake.  I was kept away and put\noff without reason.  Untrustworty was heard. All sorts of things.\nFor the brief time i was unbanned, i was NEVER returned to my position,\nalthough it was a mistake that i lost it.  I was kept and treated as\na wiz with suspicion, and comments being made about me.  It sucked.\n\nI was restored to my position.  Airborne said it was a check on Mangla.\nMangla said it was to bring back HM.  Silas voted for me cause i asked him.\nIn the time that i made elder, I restored the ninja with wilbie, tinman,\nand bobo, restored the summoners with redsexy.  recruited and set up\n7 new Gm's, reviewed and opened 5 areas, coded a clan system, and fixed\n2 whole areas.  There is much more that needs done.  And i log on every\nday to find some social archwizard speaking down from above.  Or active\nones talking down about me or to me.  Telling me what is wrong with me, \nand refusing to listen to all the facts established about what is wrong\nwith what they have done.  I have done archwizard work.  I was an archwizard.\nI have used elder position to help everyone on here, even the assholes.\n\nMany other wizards have been inspired to come back, but that momentum is dying.\nThey have been put off, forgotten, while the ALL important archwizards\nsit back for a month to discuss things.  Redsexy was ignored for a year.\nHer area forgotten.  Bobo has done more coding than any other person\nat his rank, he is ignored and put off.  I don't blame him for cutting back.\nThere are wizards that are banished and wanted to come back, but they are\nignored.  And Exos is still here even after the testimony of 7 or 8 people\nattested to his absolute wrongdoings.\n\nAfter the ninja guild was restored, players and wizards started calling for\nnew archwizards with my name being mentioned many times.  These people were\ntold point blank to shut the hell up.  I have no conception of what\nyou arches have going on in that little room, and what bullshit ideas are\nfloating around.  But face it. One coding arch, isn't going to cut it.\nThe mud blew up in sargons workroom, understandings were reached, Then ignored.\nThat Tuesday came and went a month ago.  The old ways are no longer needed.\nWho is gonna help you put in the 100 level system? Airborne? Silas?\nKryll?, maybe Warlord and Uglymoth.  Maybe Sauron when he comes back from\nhis next extended vacation.  Hello, Tatsuo has the ability, and has shown it.\nThe mantras of me being some evil son of a bitch won't work forever when\nthey are demonstrably untrue.  You know what Redsexy is right, I am BOTH.\n\nI cannot fathom the resistance to the move when everything points to a positive.\nWhen there is a chance to remove the dead weight and move up the people\nthat are bringing back the players.  The momentum as you put it is starting to slip\nwith the players.  I can spark it back up.  I will claim responsibility\nfor a large percent of the comeback that is started.  I give the rest to the\npeople who have been ignored and put off.  From what i know, there are\npotentially 3 mudlib level coders on the game besides you Mangla.\nThose are your archwizards.\nTatsuo, Wilbie, and Sargon.\n\nPlease stop bogarting the highest position in the game when others can fill \nthose positions.  calling kryll to login hasn't made him come back and fix the\nplace. and saurons instant appearance also has done little but piss me off.\nPut the level where the level belongs.  With the people that code this place,\nand enjoy it.\n\nYou want the 100 level system in, arch those people.\nYou want the guilds running and balanced, arch those people.\nYou want players coming back, arch those people.\nYou want new players, arch those people.\nYou want wizards coding and being helped with code, arch those people.\nYou want Holy Mission back, arch those people.\n\nIf you want things the way they were. Sit back and dicuss things some more with\nthe deadbeats that brought her down.\nMake some changes, shake the boat. Take action, make it fun.\nIf not, I am outta here.  \n\nI have forwarded this to every wiz that gives a damn, and i will ask that\nthese wizzes write their feelings to MANGLA and cc it to TATSUO.  I want\na clean and open debate.  I also ask that it not be sent to other arches\nwhose feelings may be hurt by it.  That is not my intention.  I i have\nspoken an untruth, let it be known.  If i am right, tell mangla to fix the\nplace.\n\nTatsuo, for Holy Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: airborne\nSubj: stuff\nCc: mangla, sauron\nDate: Mar 25\n\nI appreciate your post on the inner board.  There is a very good chance that\nI'll be returning to active coding in a few weeks.  I still need some time \naway from this place, but not as much as I originally intended to take.\nFor the record, it was never my intention to leave forever - I just wasn't\nsure when or if I would want to code again.  After some thought, I think\nthat a few weeks should be enough time to cool off with.\n\nAs I'm sure you realize, things are going to have to change for this mud\nto work.  I won't get into specifics right now, because frankly I don't\nhave all the specifics.  Mainly, I think we need to take a good look at\nhow we as wizards - from arch to newwiz - intract and work together.\n\nAnyway, thank you for your remarks.  I appreciate it.\n\nWilbie\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: turbo\nSubj: craw wurm\nCc: mangla, airborne\nDate: Mar 26\n\nToday, the craw wurm instakilled a level 29 player (Malice). As a result, it's\nlevel has been reduced from 1000 (not a typo) to 100. Very few\n(if any) monsters should have their level over 100, and certainly not over\n200.\n\nSauron\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: malice/craw wurm\nCc: airborne\nDate: Mar 26\n\nFYI, Sargon pathed Malice back to his original levels, which I think is valid because the mob's\nlevel was a bit excessive. :)\n\nSauron\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: MAX wc and ac\nCc: exos, airborne, sauron.sargon\nDate: Mar 27\n\nI know there are max ac and wc for reasons.\nI agree that without a GOOD reason, no item should be allowed to exceed them.\n\ni would, however, suggest that higher be allowed on specific mobs\n\nexample:  a ring with a 3 armor class, but a - 3 light level.\na sword that has a 30 weapon class but does 10 damage a round to its wielder\na staff that hits a mob for a max of 100, but has a 5% chance of hitting it for 200, and wielder for 50\n\nAs is, the wand may be possible, but the others are not.\n\nI am not suggesting the 'caps' be removed from max wc and ac, just\non a case by case basis, they be allowed to be exceeded\n\n\nAlso, regarding armor.\n\nAllow an armor type to be multi-type \nexample: (a suit of FULL PLATE that includes gauntlets and boots and a helmet.\nthese items dont even need to exceed legal maximums when totaled, but\nit would be one item that provided the combined AC for all four items (armor, glove, boot, helmet).\n\nI have to go, so maybe more later.\n\nAnla'shok Na Turbo, master of 1000 bugs.\n\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: sargon\nSubj: Promotions\nCc: arches, tinman, shadowmonk, brainsprain, redsexy, bobo, turbo\nDate: Mar 31\n\nAs was promised, the promotions have been made.\nThanks for your time and patience.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\ngriffon\n**\nTo: airborne\nSubj: My quests.. \nDate: Apr  3\n\nNow, I am being honest with all of these.. I was a wiz once ya know *giggles*\nI've done a few that arent on the list too. but I cant recall\nwhat they're called. *shurgs* Ok, here goes...\n\n1. Elfcity/wolf\n2. Haunter\n3. Gnome King's Treasure\n5. Vampire King\n7. Bring the orb to the monk\n8. Secret Police/ Chaos Demon\n9. Vikings \n11. Help the girl in Chantilly's Garden\n12. Kazak\n14.

Newbie quest\n\nThanks Airborne!\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: turbo\nSubj: bard skill\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr  8\n\n     One of the bard skills somehow allows a bard to sidestep a backstab.\nThis does not make snese to me, how can you sidestep an attack that\nyou do not know is coming, it is not even like the bard guild is a guild who \nis incredibly dextrious.  If there is a valid skill reason for this, I\nwould like to know, otherwise it should be changed, thieves are meant\nto rely on this one skill, backstab, for most of their damage and it is\na onetime only attack, if it is going to be blocked by your guild\nI need to decide what that means towards my guilds skills\n\nBrainsprain\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: brainsprain\nRe:   bard skill\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr  8\n\nskill?  I can think of a spell, irish luck, but a skill?\nIrish luck has a LONG recast time, and from my understanding of it\ngives AT BEST 15 dodges.  While this may seem like a lot,\n\nkeep in mind that the shadow lasts longer than 9000 seconds, \nwhich is the MAX time for their Armour of ithan.\n\nAlso, how did this come to be known?\nWhy was a thief backstabbing a bard to begin with.\nOh, and as far as not know its comming, that is why its called\nIrish Luck.  Luck can account for a lot of things, including \navoiding an attack you do not see coming.  While the message this dodge\nreturns may not be descriptive of the attack,\nthat does not disqualify it.\nAfter all, as a player, I have pounded skeletons into a pile of blood\nand body parts many times.\n\nThe message may be innaccurate, but the effect is the same.\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: turbo\nSubj: in reply to both\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr  8\n\nYeah, arches will mail all of the arches, i think wizzes works as well\nto send to everybody.\n\nAs to to skill or spell, that is fine, what happened was malice and treat\nwere in the arena and I was watching the battle over malices shoulder.\nI watched treat sidestep a backstab, which made no sense whatsoever to me.  When i asked him how he did it\nhe refused to cooperate, so i asked him if it was a skill, and if it was\nthat it would suffice, he told me it was a skill, so i asked him what \nthat skill was, he wouldn't tell me (telling me, of course, would have\ns\nsettled this without you and I even having to discuss it, I think this is,\nbtw, a very valid skill.  \n\nThanks for the info, i wont be coding around the spell, i think it is very valid,\nbut I do have one question: What level does a bard have to be\nin order to get that skill and does it take the attackers level\ninto account, I think it should, that way lvl 22 bards arent dodging attacks\nfrom L10 thieves (just an example).  \n\nThanks turbo\n\nThe sprain\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: airborne\nSubj: First goldsun area\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr 14\n\nI have revised the first of goldsun's area .. the poorly named\n7-islands (since there are only 6)  However, I have my own\narea, a huge island, that i am going to rebuild into the \n7th island.  That aside, I would like to get the area put\ninto play as soon as possible, it is in:\n/players/brainsprain/goldsun/7-islands/\n\n\n**\n"
