If the newwiz goes directly\nto an arch or another wiz then that is the personal choice\nof the newwiz. The key to the whole thing is we do not\nwant newwiz areas in. (As has happened recently) and we do not\nwant poor areas that have not been check and have more errors\nthan rooms to make it into the mud. Seems like common sense to me!\n\n-Mangla\n\nPS: As for Turbo, he wanted a fast approval and so I told him to\nget some other wizzes to go through it and give comments then he\ncould ask an arch to do the run through thing and wallah!\n\n**\n"
