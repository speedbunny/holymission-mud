I am getting very angry with the thief guild and was wondering if you knew what the ruling is.  \n\nThanks\n\nTodd\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: tetsuhara\nSubj: my area\nDate: Dec 15\n\ni talked with my friend and he gave me several ideas for creatures \nin my area.  I am still waiting to catch tatsuo online\nso we can discuss the \"no fear\" property\nAND a no-spell property -- i want to make a critter immune to all spells\nExos did that a while ago with his lagbeast\n\n**\nexos\n**\nTo: daniella\nSubj: Merry Xmas\nCc: turbo, tuppence, bellissima, sargon, sauron, demolian, tetsuhara\nDate: Dec 18\n\nI just wanted to wish you all a Merry Christmas.\nI am not going to be around here much anymore.\nLets just say my time here is done.\n\nIf you wish to email me, you can reach me at greatkender@hotmail.com\nI check my email many times during day as I work on a niec T1.\n\nHappy Holidays and Good Luck to you all.\n\nExos / Steve\n\n**\nzathras\n**\nTo: tetsuhara\nSubj: area\nCc: exos, tatsuo, wilbie, tas\nDate: Jan 20\n\nfrom south of church, go west to the sand, then south until you reach my area!\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: tetsuhara\nSubj: My area\nDate: Jan 22\n\nNo hurry.  It isnt going anywhere (I hope!), so take your time\nI have to get going, I have a hard time being on late at night (for me anyway)\nLet me know what you think of it\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: tetsuhara\nSubj: Ninja\nCc: tatsuo. bobo\nDate: Mar 15\n\nI'm sorry to see you leaving Ninja.  Also, I apologize for the bullshit\nanswers that you got on the Ninja board concerning Ryu.  I'm not sure\nwhy Sargon was answering Ninja questions in the first place, but I didn't \nthink his \"stay in the church\" comment was at all appropriate.  You posed \nwhat was, in my opinion, a very reasonable question.\n\nThe reason that Ryu is so tough is the Daito.  When you earn a Daito, we are\nessentially giving you the most powerful weapon in the game - and making it\nautoloading.  In order to justify this, Ryu has to be an extremely difficult\nopponent.  I myself died about four times to him...  In the same day.  \nAfter getting my sword, I found it to be worth the effort :)\n\nBearing the prize in mind, I can't see making Ryu less difficult.  However,\nI do intend to make more information available about Ryu and what people \nwill be facing.  When I was doing the quest, there were literally dozens of\nNinja on at any given time to give me advice - these days, I think we need \nto have more information in the game itself.\n\nThanks for helping us playtest, by the way :)\nWilbie\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: ati\nFwd:  Archood\nCc: widge, tetsuhara\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Archood\nCc: akira, uruz, waldo, redsexy, bobo, wilbie, tinman, sargon, tatsuo, shadowmonk, nae\nDate: Mar 22\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a final effort at swaying you towards seeing a reasonable course of action\nfor Holy Mission, a great game that is not fun with the people that are running it\nthe way it is and has been run.  I have layed out many reasons why i want to be arch\nand i am consistantly put off and ignored.  The arches want to do everything behind \nclosed doors.  I am sending this letter to Mangla, who of all the arches, is the\nonly one that codes, and has been here, and who has admittedly pointed out that\nhe forgets things, and misses things, because of everything that needs done.\n\nCoding for HM is something that I enjoy to the fullest, but it has not been fun.\nAt every turn I have an archwizard speaking down at me, lying about me or at\nleast continuing an untrue rumor to others, THIS IS LOGGED, I have sent it to \nmangla.  We have archwizards who last coded 5 years ago.  We have archwizards\nwith outside commitments that take up space here.  We have archwizards that\ntake off 5 months and turn up like messiahs reasserting their rightful positions\nand casting down judgements. And we have one coding arch.\n\nFor 3 and one half years I watched the mud go through death throws, as players\nand wizards were driven off by shitty policies, guild closings, and the mud\nbeing moved around( all reasons I have heard).  Sauron, of the beloved\nninja guild had 3.5 years to recode ninja, he also had 3.5 years to\nput the monk into a bin system, and do something to balance it.  It just wasn't\ndone.  I do not know what he has done, but i can only speak of what wasn't done,\nand ask if opening and fixing these guilds was less important that what was done.\n\nThere was plenty of time for these people to \"shit or get off the pot\".\nIt wasn't done.  For those of you who do not know, or who have prescribed to\nthe rumors that abound.  I was banned by mistake.  I was kept away and put\noff without reason.  Untrustworty was heard. All sorts of things.\nFor the brief time i was unbanned, i was NEVER returned to my position,\nalthough it was a mistake that i lost it.  I was kept and treated as\na wiz with suspicion, and comments being made about me.  It sucked.\n\nI was restored to my position.  Airborne said it was a check on Mangla.\nMangla said it was to bring back HM.  Silas voted for me cause i asked him.\nIn the time that i made elder, I restored the ninja with wilbie, tinman,\nand bobo, restored the summoners with redsexy.  recruited and set up\n7 new Gm's, reviewed and opened 5 areas, coded a clan system, and fixed\n2 whole areas.  There is much more that needs done.  And i log on every\nday to find some social archwizard speaking down from above.  Or active\nones talking down about me or to me.  Telling me what is wrong with me, \nand refusing to listen to all the facts established about what is wrong\nwith what they have done.  I have done archwizard work.  I was an archwizard.\nI have used elder position to help everyone on here, even the assholes.\n\nMany other wizards have been inspired to come back, but that momentum is dying.\nThey have been put off, forgotten, while the ALL important archwizards\nsit back for a month to discuss things.  Redsexy was ignored for a year.\nHer area forgotten.  Bobo has done more coding than any other person\nat his rank, he is ignored and put off.  I don't blame him for cutting back.\nThere are wizards that are banished and wanted to come back, but they are\nignored.  And Exos is still here even after the testimony of 7 or 8 people\nattested to his absolute wrongdoings.\n\nAfter the ninja guild was restored, players and wizards started calling for\nnew archwizards with my name being mentioned many times.  These people were\ntold point blank to shut the hell up.  I have no conception of what\nyou arches have going on in that little room, and what bullshit ideas are\nfloating around.  But face it. One coding arch, isn't going to cut it.\nThe mud blew up in sargons workroom, understandings were reached, Then ignored.\nThat Tuesday came and went a month ago.  The old ways are no longer needed.\nWho is gonna help you put in the 100 level system? Airborne? Silas?\nKryll?, maybe Warlord and Uglymoth.  Maybe Sauron when he comes back from\nhis next extended vacation.  Hello, Tatsuo has the ability, and has shown it.\nThe mantras of me being some evil son of a bitch won't work forever when\nthey are demonstrably untrue.  You know what Redsexy is right, I am BOTH.\n\nI cannot fathom the resistance to the move when everything points to a positive.\nWhen there is a chance to remove the dead weight and move up the people\nthat are bringing back the players.  The momentum as you put it is starting to slip\nwith the players.  I can spark it back up.  I will claim responsibility\nfor a large percent of the comeback that is started.  I give the rest to the\npeople who have been ignored and put off.  From what i know, there are\npotentially 3 mudlib level coders on the game besides you Mangla.\nThose are your archwizards.\nTatsuo, Wilbie, and Sargon.\n\nPlease stop bogarting the highest position in the game when others can fill \nthose positions.  calling kryll to login hasn't made him come back and fix the\nplace. and saurons instant appearance also has done little but piss me off.\nPut the level where the level belongs.  With the people that code this place,\nand enjoy it.\n\nYou want the 100 level system in, arch those people.\nYou want the guilds running and balanced, arch those people.\nYou want players coming back, arch those people.\nYou want new players, arch those people.\nYou want wizards coding and being helped with code, arch those people.\nYou want Holy Mission back, arch those people.\n\nIf you want things the way they were. Sit back and dicuss things some more with\nthe deadbeats that brought her down.\nMake some changes, shake the boat. Take action, make it fun.\nIf not, I am outta here.  \n\nI have forwarded this to every wiz that gives a damn, and i will ask that\nthese wizzes write their feelings to MANGLA and cc it to TATSUO.  I want\na clean and open debate.  I also ask that it not be sent to other arches\nwhose feelings may be hurt by it.  That is not my intention.  I i have\nspoken an untruth, let it be known.  If i am right, tell mangla to fix the\nplace.\n\nTatsuo, for Holy Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n"
