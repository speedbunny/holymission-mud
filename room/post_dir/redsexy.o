Use\nthe efun ctime( adjusted_time_value ) to get the time returned as a string.\nThe biggest problem is that we don't have logged who is from which timezone.\nSo you could either build a huge database wherein you link sites with\ntimezones (note this needs continuous upgrading!!) or you could have players\ninput their own timezone somewhere along the line.\n\n2) the basic idea is to set into the room leading to the next world a type\ninteger (or better even a type status) variable monster_dead. Add a function:\nvoid set_monster_dead( int i ) {\n}\n\nThen check for if the move is allowed by using the move() function as is\ncoded in /room/room.c. I assumed the exit was 'enter'. The rest of the code\nis a pretty standard way to handle move checks. If unclear, just ask :-)\nThis would be the neatest way, but you might as well add an action enter,\nwhich uses the same check for monster_dead, if you like.int move( string str ) {\n  if( !str ) str = query_verb()\n  if( str == enter && monster_dead ) {\n    notify_fail( You cannot go that way right now.\\n )\n    return 0\n  }\n  return ::move( str )\n}\n\nNext, in the monster you need to add two things as well. At creation time\nyou need a call to the room, to allow the entrance to be used again:\nvoid reset( int arg ) {\n  ...other reset code...\n  call_other( room_file, set_monster_dead, 0 )\n}\n\nThen there is a function monster_died that automatically gets called when the\nmonster dies. It must return 0 for the monster to actually die (if non-zero,\nthe monster stays alive. can be used for some neat features as well):\nint monster_died() {\n  call_other( room_file, set_monster_dead, 1 )\n  return 0\n}\n\n3) There are basically two ways of doing this:\nA) In the monster_died() function you check all players online for the\nfile_name of the room they are in. If you have the area in a separate\ndirectory, you could check for that path in the room's file name and at\na match move the player back.\nB) When entering or leaving the area, you add/remove the player's name\nto/from a global variable (i.e. string *entered;) in the room. Then add\na function that moves the players stored in the variable back to the entry\nroom. Then add to monster_died() in the monster code a call to this\nfunction.\nFor either case consider the possibilities of teleports. If the area is\nnot entirely non-teleport, players may return there even after the monster\ndied.\n\nHopefully these remarks prove a bit useful to you.\nAll the best,\n\nUglymouth\n\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: comments\nDate: Nov 24\n\nDisclaimer: Please do not be personally offended by what you are about to\n            read... It is not a personal attack on you... just your\n            coding. ;D I do not pull punches.\n\nOk, lets start with general coding principles... :)\n\nI don't know who's code you copied when you started coding, but I really\nwish you'd asked either Mangla or Jez or myself for a decent example\nbefore you did...\n\nThe first rule of coding is indentation. This is very important for anyone\nwho is going to (attempt to) read your code now or in the future. Proper\nand consistent indentation helps the reader to follow the functions, help\nyou to keep track of things like curly braces for functions and if\nstatements, and hence helps you debug swiftly and painlessly. To this end,\ntake a look in /players/sauron/redsexy/ at the two files I indented. My\ngeneral rule is to indent 4 spaces whenever you open another { but you can\nindent anything from 2 - 4 as you see fit.  Spacing is also important to  \nmake the code clearer for people to read.\n\nMy suggestion would be to play around with different styles and see what\nis most comfortable for you to work with. Some ppl like to space   \neverything out. Others like to put ( )  around everything to separate \nthings. The driver will ignore spaces, and ( ) as long as they 'balance' \nso it's up to you. I have used my personal preference in the 2 files I\nindented, so you can look at those and see what you think. My only other\npiece of advice on this would be: don't take things to extremes. Too much\n(or too little) indentation/spacing can make code just as hard to read as\ncode which is inconsistently indented/spaced.\n\nThe second thing you will note is that the functions have extra words in\nthem. For example:\n\nreset(arg) {\n\nhas become\n\nvoid reset(int arg) {\n\nThis is called strict typing, and this also helps anyone reading your code\nto understand what is going on. In LPC, every function and every variable\nhas a type...\n\nThe type of a variable is the type of value it holds. The type of a\nfunction is the type of value it returns. If a function doesn't return\nanything, you can set it's return type to 'void' (and then use statements\nlike \"if(blah) return;\".\n\nIn principle, when creating your own functions, you can make these types\nanything you wish.  However, when working with predefined mud functions,\nyou have to follow mud rules. For example, the function reset() takes an\ninteger as an argument, and no return value is expected.\n\nHence the above definition. Similarly, init()  doesn't have any arguments,\nand no return value is expected. There are other mud defined functions\n(such as exit() which is called when you exit a room, and like init()\ntakes no arguments and returns no value) but reset() and init() are the\nmain two.\n\nThe other area where there are fixed rules regarding the types for a\nfunction is when creating functions for actions declared using\nadd_action(). In this case, the single argument to the function is always \na string, and the return type should always be an integer - 1 for a   \nsuccessful action, and 0 for a failure.\n\nYou can specify a failure message using notify_fail() if you so wish. In\nthat case, if the command fails totally, the msg will be displayed\n(assuming that no other notify_fail msg is specified in subsiquent\ncommands that match the cmd entered by the player). Note that if you\nreturn 1 from the function, it is considered to have succeeded, and hence\nthe notify_fail msg will not be used.\n\nAbove all, you should be consistent. You should not return 2 or more\ndifferent types from the same function (unless you mean to of course ;).\nHence, using your dig function as an example, if the argument doesn't\nmatch, simply return 0.\n\nOk, now onto specifics...\n\nI'm not sure what you were trying to do with the dig function in the\ninherit room, but it confused the hell out of me!  There must be a nicer\nway to do whatever it is you want to do. Do you ever plan to have that cmd\ndo anything useful, or is it just a 'goof-off'? :)  If you want it to be\nuseful, I can come up with a good system for you. If it's just a goofy    \ncmd, I can still come up with a good system... :)  Messing around with\nyour argument value like that isn't generally a good thing... you lose\ntrack of what the command giver actually typed (a piece of data which is\nsometimes very useful), and it can get kinda confusing.\n\nI only took a look at one of the actual rooms - I couldn't face the rest.\n;D The descriptions are fine... I'm not going to comment on those at this\ntime. Once again, the above suggestions apply... indentation, spacing,   \nstrict typing. I've also added a useful trick with dealing with long\nstrings in code... As you can see, you can 'wrap' a string onto a new line\nusing the '\\' character... This avoids string addition, and makes the code\nflow better when being read. It also means that you can see how the final\nlong_desc will turn out. I saw that you like to have 2 spaces after the\nend of a sentence. Personally I LOATHE that convention, but if you want it\nthat way, that's up to you. :)\n\nMy only other request/suggestion would be to make a map of the area so\nthat ppl who test the area for you can refer to it for things like  \nchecking exits, and finding their way around. Soon, I intend to make it a\nrequirement for area approval that a map is present in the area dir for   \nreference, so it's a good idea to get used to it. :)\n\nGeneral suggestions...\n\nOk, I always find it a good idea to separate the code for each area in  \nyour directory. This may not seem important now, but when you have 5\nareas, and the monsters for all of them are in /players/redsexy/monster/\nyou'll realise what i'm talking about. :) The easiest way is to create   \nsubdirs in each area dir. In this case, you created\n/players/redsexy/areas/island/. From there you could have a rooms subdir \nfor rooms (everything that is in /players/redsexy/areas/island now), a\nmonsters subdir (for whatever is in /players/redsexy/monsters) and an\nobjects subdir (for whatever is in /players/redsexy/objects). You may wish\nto create a secure subdir for 'sensitive' information such as quest\nsolutions or just info that you want to keep from the prying eyes of   \nwizards like the map for a maze where players can find good items. I would\nalso suggest limiting the number of such subdirs... For example, there is\nno need to create armour and weapons subdirs (IMHO) - everything can go in\nthe general 'objects' subdir. Once again, it's a personal preference. \n\nI see that you have a defs.h file. I also see that you copied it from\nMangla's dir and simply changed the paths... :) If you don't understand   \nhow they work, ask and I will explain them to you. They can be very\nhelpful if you use certain phrases alot in your code.\n\nHmm... have I said enough for now? I think so - you have alot to digest\nthere. If you have questions, please feel free to ask. Sometime soon I  \nhope to get some decent examples written for my mentees, so I'll let you\nhave a copy of them as well (assuming that I get done before you finish \nyour area :). I am also creating a general MuD/LPC web page, but I only  \nstarted that last week, so it's not got very far yet.\n\nHave a nice day... :) I'll be on later today.\n\nDave\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: address\nDate: Dec 17\n\nCindi Cardinale/Mark Wheeler\n15 Rollins Ave\nPearl River, NY 10965\nUSA\n\n:)\n\nOkay\nCin\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: I miss you\nDate: Jan  1\n\nWhere are you girl, i never see you around anymore, i miss you\nam i cast off as so much flotsam and \njetsam???\n\n\nStiletto (err Brainsprain)\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: my address\nDate: Apr  8\n\nMy school address\n\nEric Tucker\n3468 Freedom Quad\nUniversity At Albany\n1400 Washington Ave.\nAlbany NY, 12222\n\nat home (summer)\n\nEric Tucker\n173 North Rd.\nFort Ann, NY 12827\n\n\n**\nredlego\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: whats up???\nDate: Jul 28\n\nHEY YOU, whats goin on??????@!!!!?!??!????!!?!?\n\n\n**\ndoolotz\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: addie\nCc: q\nDate: Aug 29\n\n130.89.227.77 3400\nor\ndanceable.student.utwente.nl 3400\nDoo\n\n**\nparis\n**\nTo: redsexy\nRe:   Hi hi\nDate: Sep  2\n\nWhilst still on the subject, here's my numbers *laugh*\nMobile: 0973 326078\nHome:   0181 922 6935\n\nttfn\nmike\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: i am back\nDate: Sep 11\n\nI am back, where are you, would like to talk to you.\n\nMay have discovered some things of interest to you.\n\nTuck\n\n**\ngareth\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: Heya!\nDate: Sep 26\n\n\nNice plan! - hehehehe I'm a libra you know - heheheheheh.\n\nGar.\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: summonre\nCc: redsexy, wilbie\nDate: Mar  7\n\nI found the file that could possibly crash the mud in the summoners\nIt can be easily removed\nscontrol.c in the obj dir\nremoving the seeker is no big deal\nI can't find any other reason to to reopen the guild.\nI will bin it up and remove the seeker, and that should be good to go\nRedsexy or wilbie have bothed voiced interest in running that guild.\n\n2.\nBarb guild moved back to original location.\n\n3.

I have layed out many reasons why i want to be arch\nand i am consistantly put off and ignored.  The arches want to do everything behind \nclosed doors.  I am sending this letter to Mangla, who of all the arches, is the\nonly one that codes, and has been here, and who has admittedly pointed out that\nhe forgets things, and misses things, because of everything that needs done.\n\nCoding for HM is something that I enjoy to the fullest, but it has not been fun.\nAt every turn I have an archwizard speaking down at me, lying about me or at\nleast continuing an untrue rumor to others, THIS IS LOGGED, I have sent it to \nmangla.  We have archwizards who last coded 5 years ago.  We have archwizards\nwith outside commitments that take up space here.  We have archwizards that\ntake off 5 months and turn up like messiahs reasserting their rightful positions\nand casting down judgements. And we have one coding arch.\n\nFor 3 and one half years I watched the mud go through death throws, as players\nand wizards were driven off by shitty policies, guild closings, and the mud\nbeing moved around( all reasons I have heard).  Sauron, of the beloved\nninja guild had 3.5 years to recode ninja, he also had 3.5 years to\nput the monk into a bin system, and do something to balance it.  It just wasn't\ndone.  I do not know what he has done, but i can only speak of what wasn't done,\nand ask if opening and fixing these guilds was less important that what was done.\n\nThere was plenty of time for these people to \"shit or get off the pot\".\nIt wasn't done.  For those of you who do not know, or who have prescribed to\nthe rumors that abound.  I was banned by mistake.  I was kept away and put\noff without reason.  Untrustworty was heard. All sorts of things.\nFor the brief time i was unbanned, i was NEVER returned to my position,\nalthough it was a mistake that i lost it.  I was kept and treated as\na wiz with suspicion, and comments being made about me.  It sucked.\n\nI was restored to my position.  Airborne said it was a check on Mangla.\nMangla said it was to bring back HM.  Silas voted for me cause i asked him.\nIn the time that i made elder, I restored the ninja with wilbie, tinman,\nand bobo, restored the summoners with redsexy.  recruited and set up\n7 new Gm's, reviewed and opened 5 areas, coded a clan system, and fixed\n2 whole areas.  There is much more that needs done.  And i log on every\nday to find some social archwizard speaking down from above.  Or active\nones talking down about me or to me.  Telling me what is wrong with me, \nand refusing to listen to all the facts established about what is wrong\nwith what they have done.  I have done archwizard work.  I was an archwizard.\nI have used elder position to help everyone on here, even the assholes.\n\nMany other wizards have been inspired to come back, but that momentum is dying.\nThey have been put off, forgotten, while the ALL important archwizards\nsit back for a month to discuss things.  Redsexy was ignored for a year.\nHer area forgotten.  Bobo has done more coding than any other person\nat his rank, he is ignored and put off.  I don't blame him for cutting back.\nThere are wizards that are banished and wanted to come back, but they are\nignored.  And Exos is still here even after the testimony of 7 or 8 people\nattested to his absolute wrongdoings.\n\nAfter the ninja guild was restored, players and wizards started calling for\nnew archwizards with my name being mentioned many times.  These people were\ntold point blank to shut the hell up.  I have no conception of what\nyou arches have going on in that little room, and what bullshit ideas are\nfloating around.  But face it. One coding arch, isn't going to cut it.\nThe mud blew up in sargons workroom, understandings were reached, Then ignored.\nThat Tuesday came and went a month ago.  The old ways are no longer needed.\nWho is gonna help you put in the 100 level system? Airborne? Silas?\nKryll?, maybe Warlord and Uglymoth.  Maybe Sauron when he comes back from\nhis next extended vacation.  Hello, Tatsuo has the ability, and has shown it.\nThe mantras of me being some evil son of a bitch won't work forever when\nthey are demonstrably untrue.  You know what Redsexy is right, I am BOTH.\n\nI cannot fathom the resistance to the move when everything points to a positive.\nWhen there is a chance to remove the dead weight and move up the people\nthat are bringing back the players.  The momentum as you put it is starting to slip\nwith the players.  I can spark it back up.  I will claim responsibility\nfor a large percent of the comeback that is started.  I give the rest to the\npeople who have been ignored and put off.  From what i know, there are\npotentially 3 mudlib level coders on the game besides you Mangla.\nThose are your archwizards.\nTatsuo, Wilbie, and Sargon.\n\nPlease stop bogarting the highest position in the game when others can fill \nthose positions.  calling kryll to login hasn't made him come back and fix the\nplace. and saurons instant appearance also has done little but piss me off.\nPut the level where the level belongs.  With the people that code this place,\nand enjoy it.\n\nYou want the 100 level system in, arch those people.\nYou want the guilds running and balanced, arch those people.\nYou want players coming back, arch those people.\nYou want new players, arch those people.\nYou want wizards coding and being helped with code, arch those people.\nYou want Holy Mission back, arch those people.\n\nIf you want things the way they were. Sit back and dicuss things some more with\nthe deadbeats that brought her down.\nMake some changes, shake the boat. Take action, make it fun.\nIf not, I am outta here.  \n\nI have forwarded this to every wiz that gives a damn, and i will ask that\nthese wizzes write their feelings to MANGLA and cc it to TATSUO.  I want\na clean and open debate.  I also ask that it not be sent to other arches\nwhose feelings may be hurt by it.  That is not my intention.  I i have\nspoken an untruth, let it be known.  If i am right, tell mangla to fix the\nplace.\n\nTatsuo, for Holy Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: redsexy\nFwd:  mail\nCc: bobo, uruz, waldo, wilbie, tinman, thumper\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: mail\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nI recently reseved a letter that had some stronge statements made in it.\nOdds are you know the one I am talking about. We stand at a cross roads,\nit is no secret that this mud is dead, but there is hope. Recently the old\ncoders have returned, and with them some new players. This mud can be\ngreat once again. \"These are the time that try mens souls\" Henry V. I\nsay that because people don't seem to like change, it seems to try there\nsouls. Well its time to put the games aside and start to do what is best\nfor the mud. Tatsuo has shown that he can get things done. Why then do\nwe not let him do this. The answer would seem to be with the arches. I have\nno clue what you guys do, but I see what you don't do, and this is help\nthis place. We need new arches and new changes to be made. I FULLY suport\nthe ideas set forth by Tatsuo and some of the others wizes. Given this\nI stand with them and or walk with them, please let it be the former than\nthe latter.\n                                       Akira\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: redsexy\nFwd:  Tatsuo / Archwiz\nCc: sargon, akira, uruz, waldo, wilbie, bobo, tinman, widge, icehouse, ati\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo / Archwiz\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nWell I'm only a beginner, and actually this is the 1st MUD i've ever been on. And I may not know much about what all the details are, but I can say that Tatsuo is someone on here who I could immediately tell that he knew what he was doing.\nWhen there was a bug, Tatsuo fixes it. When we bump into each other, he converses with me. I constantly see him on here and he has never EVER said anything like \"Well hold on. I'm busy.\"\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding. But once I met people like Tatsuo and Redsexy who were this friendly, I haven't even tried one of the other 500 muds on this list of mine. That should show how attractive this place is. And if all the other Archwizzes made it what it is today, I'm sure those two can help make it what it will be tomorrow.\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding.

In order to accomplish everything that \nneeds to be done here, that just won't do.  We either need new arches or the\narches need to pass on some roles to the elders.  It's very simple.\n\nThis is not a rip on Airborne, or any other arch.  Actually, let me rephrase\nthat part...  This is not a rip on Airborne, but it IS a rip on the others.\nAirborne still logs in, and he still makes a visible effort.  But the fact\nremains that Mangla is the only arch who plays a primary role in Holy Mission.\nMangla makes the decisions.  Mangla makes the policy.  Airborne acts as sort\nof a check - just to keep things balanced.\n\nAs for the other arches, how in the hell can a person be considered an arch\nwhen they never log on and do anything?  Popping in now and then to vote on\nsomething that you don't even care about doesn't count.\n\nThis is also not a rip on Mangla.  Personally, I have no problem with Mangla.\nThe problem I have is that Mangla (purposely or not) has placed the entire\nMud on his shoulders.  One person just doesn't cut it.  It doesn't matter if\nyou have the best intentions in the world.  One person does not make a mud.\n\nPersonally, I think Tatsuo would make a very good arch.  Quite frankly, I \nthink a great number of the people we have right now would make great arches.\nLet's stop thinking of the \"arch\" position as some elite rank.  It's just \nanother level with more work involved.  If someone has the ability, and the\ndesire, they should be given the opportunity to do the work.  \n\nThey certainly have more business with that rank than someone who never\nlogs in.\n\nOne last thing, for the record.  I don't want to be an arch.  If raising my\nlevel will help me help this mud then yes, I'm all for promotion.  Promote\nme to whatever I can best help you with.  To me, that's all rank is.  It's\naccess to do more good for the Mud.\n\n**\nsatia\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: fantasia\nCc:  \nDate: Mar 24\n\nI will be on Fantasia for a bit:\n206.129.8.221 4030\n\n**\nallsiante\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: just a word\nDate: Mar 26\n\nHi !\n\nI gotta go now, but i'll be back in a few hours or tomorrow - for sure.\nIm level 17 now and need 5% for 18 - almost full stats, just wis and chr arent full\ni think i'm doin good :)\nso see ya later\nbye ! - and kisses\nAllsiante\n\n**\nmorrolan\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: idea\nDate: Mar 27\n\n\nhey..i have an idea for a diff area other than \ncolossus'\n\ni'll let you know next time i see you\n\n-mark\n\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: Strike\nCc: sargon, shadowmonk, nae, bobo, nunu, turbo, tinman, thumper, akira, nylakoorub\nDate: Mar 27\n\nI propose a coding strike, to let the arches know that we are not going to\nput up with their shit anymore.  They have had THREE YEARS to get this mud\nback together, and so far they've failed miserably.  Furthermore, they've\nallowed personal vandettas to hinder the progress of the mud.\n\nI suggest the following conditions to begin coding again:\n\n1.  Reinstate Tatsuo.  That's a given.  He's done more for this mud in a\n    month than all of the arches did in three years.\n\n2.  Demote ALL inactive arches.  Kryll, Magnal, Sauron, Airborne.  These four\n    have done nothing for three years.  Sauron has been \"working on the lib\",\n    Airborne comes in to read boards, and Kryll hasn't done shit.  As for\n    Magnal - who the hell is Magnal?  \n\n3.  Mangla must either step down from arch or promote at\n    LEAST one more arch in order to balance the power.\n\nIf you agree to this, post it.

It's supposed to be a fun game.  But \nI'll tell you what Nae...  After you've spent the time coding hundreds of\nrooms, items, and monsters, and after you've spend the time testing and \nrecoding a few guilds - only to have it mean NOTHING because a couple \narchwizards decide to play dictator - you tell me you're not a little \npissed about it.  You listen to three years of bullshit and tell me you're\nnot frustrated.  \n\nAt the very least, I would have at least expected a litte consideration from\nyou.  I thought we were friends - my mistake.\n\nAs for the rest of you, I'll say it again.  It's your mud...  if you want it,\nyou've gotta take it.\n\nThere's a good chance that I'll be banished soon - it's how our arches deal\nwith us \"subversive\" types.  If I am, have a good one.  I hope the best for\nHoly Mission and for all of you.  \n\nWilbie\ncphite@lightstream.net\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: turbo\nSubj: stuff\nCc: bobo, akira, redsexy, tuppence, nunu\nDate: Mar 29\n\nIf anyone wants to keep in touch, please send me an email\nat the following:\n\ncphite@lightstream.net\n\nInclude your ICQ number and nickname if you have one (if you don't have\nICQ you should get it - you'll like it)...\n\nThanks.\n\n**\nnae\n**\nTo: wilbie\nRe:   strike\nCc: nae, turbo, bobo, nunu, redsexy, akira\nDate: Mar 30\n\nYes, we ARE friends. But I'm sorry, I'm not a sheep.\n*I* don't agree with you that the arches are dictators.\n*I* dont agree that they're ruining the mud.\nI happen to think that the best way we can make the\nmud better is to all work together... which is CLEARLY\nnot what you were asking for.\n\nI'm sorry. If you open a discussion, and call for\nresponses, dont act like it's the end of the world\nwhen they dont agree with you.\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: sargon\nSubj: Promotions\nCc: arches, tinman, shadowmonk, brainsprain, redsexy, bobo, turbo\nDate: Mar 31\n\nAs was promised, the promotions have been made.\nThanks for your time and patience.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nbgs\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: 'bout wizzing higher\nDate: Mar 31\n\n\n Hi !\n\nMcLoud told me that you would be my mentor.

First, for some reason the fire\ndemon would occasiionally bug and tell him what 4-7 times every\ntime he attacked.  And also when he joined it did not\ngive him a brooch or prism.  I am triying to fix both\nproblems but might not be able to, the players name is\nlyric.\n\n\n**\nbgs\n**\nTo: redsexy\nRe:   mentoring\nDate: Apr  2\n\n\n\n Hi !\n\nI hope you'll get better soon !

And is Bobo going to use the ryu rooms? If not I need to\nknow so I can start to change them. If I have to change the add_action\n(\"say\") thing please advise me in another way of doing that. I have\n2 rooms in the area like that so it helps when you point out a mistake\nand then give a suggestion on how to correst it. Until next, keep the\nfaith.\n                        Akira\n\n**\nakira\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: area\nDate: Apr  9\n\nJust to let you know ahead in the area there is something called the\nCronus sphere, it is not spelled wrong, it is a play on words. I\nknow chronus menas time but Cronus was the first god, so please do not\nthink i typoed it ment it that way.

And new start is the\nbarbarian plains open3. Its a mountain face, I can link onto\nthe mud threw there. So please show me what a full stop is.\nRemeber I am not a great coder here. I mostly like to tell a\nstory, white a txt file, and make it so you can role play\non the mud. Thats why i always worked with guilds, they were\nvery interactive with me. Show me what to change and I will\nthink about it, if its to much work, I quit.\n                                  Akira\n\n**\n"
