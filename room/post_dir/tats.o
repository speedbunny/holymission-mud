I log in once a week and try and check my mail. Pretty much zero time. Not been ignoring you just have not had time to respond. Sorry see what I can do. Even now only on for 2 minutes from work.\n\n   Haplo\n\n**\nexos\n**\nTo: tats\nSubj: About tatsuo\n\nDate: Nov 25\n\nLast time Tatsuo logged in was from Bloomington, IN\n\n**\ntats\n**\nTo: herp\nSubj: greetings\nCc: tats\nDate: May 21\n\n\nHello old friend,\n\nIt's me Tatsuo writing to you again.\nI have spent 2 years trying to get reinstated from a mistake made by\na simple New wizzes mistatement on the wiz line.\n\nRemember when Leslie answered that It was me that altered your prison code,\nwhen I actually had no access, and it was sourcer.\n\nCouple people used that event as a launch pad to keep me banned.\nYou did unban me once.  But Mangla rebanned me soon after.  I believe\nhe said i had a tool i was not supposed to have.  \n\nSeeing as I was banned as a Lord, and my directory was erased and stored in\nHaplo's.  I had used a tool to mass copy it back.\n\n\nThis has been a sore spot for me for 2 and a half years.\n\nI would very much like to be restored.  I currently code with James over on \nRealmsmud.\n\nAnd the Holy Mission that I have been a part of for so long is Not the same\nplace it was when I left.\n\n\nThanks.\n\n\nDavid Goodman, AKA Tatsuo - Pittsburgh PA.

First sentence had be ready for a good one,\nbut you kinda fizzled...\n\nYou shoulda listed possible reasons people who hate you, stuff like,\n\"Do you hate me because I'm beautiful?\"...  \n\nNext time, get those standards up there...\n\nOh, and for the record, I have no problem with you returning.\n\nAirborne\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: tats\nRe:   North Carolina\nDate: Sep  5\n\nactually I moved up to Richmond, Va a little over a year\nago. Was living in Raleigh though. That owuld be about 2 hours\nfrom where you are is I remember correctly.\n\nJewel I think live in Durham again. Another 30 minutes\nup I-40. But I am not too sure on that one.\n\n-Mangla\n\nPS. Hope you like NC. A little, well a lot really,\nhotter than you would be used to. Down east in the state\nis not the best part. Move up towards Raleigh and over\ntowards the mountains and you have some really nice\nstuff :)\n\n**\njewel\n**\nTo: tats\nRe:   Tatsuo\nDate: Sep  9\n\nhey there!!\n\nWhat did you think of the hurricane?  Might rainy and windy eh? \n\nOf course I remember your name!  Congrats on your engagement and your move.  I bought a house and now live in Raleigh, NC.  You should call if you're ever in town and we can get together.  919 844 6310\n\nWhere are you working?  Is your gf from NC?\n\nCongrats and good luck!\n\nHeather :)\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: tats\nRe:   reason to get tatsuo back to Lord\nDate: Sep 13\n\nHeh.  That reason alone qualifies as far as I am concerned.\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: tats\nRe:   read this\nDate: Sep 23\n\nWell, I think you have to find a way to make Mangla realize that this\nmud is here for more than his own personal enjoyment.  As far as I am\naware, he is the only block in your returning.\n\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: tats\nRe:   replies\nDate: Oct  5\n\nI wish I had something positive to tell you...  but I don't.\n\nSorry man.\n\n**\n"
