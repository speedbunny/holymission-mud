All the nurses and doctors have\nbeen telling us all that we should be swimming so I'm going to \ntake the plunge !!\nI ordered my cot and pram as well this week..I can't wait to walk\ndown the street with my pram ...its so swanky  :)\nI've gutted the spare bedroom as well..its got nothing in it \nnow. Davids dad wants to decorate it so we just have to pick the \npaper now.\nWork is getting so busy these days..all these pain in the ****\namericans are driving us nuts !!!  *GRIN*\nNever mind only 3 more months then I give up.

I'm still abit dubious about being away\nwith my parents. \n\nWell thats 5 months up now and junior is moving around quite abuit now. You can really tell now by looking at me...its so weird !! I'm\npossessed !!\nOnly another 2-3 months left at work then I'm becing a proper housewife :)\n\nNot much been happening here lately...weather is really crap...won't stop\nraining. We've got the spare room stripped as Davids Dad wants to get stuck in straight after his holidays....there away in majorca just now and get back a\ncouple of days after us.\n\nWell I better go and get my shower and get ready to go....I'll probably have\nlots of horror stories to tell you when I get back...\n\nTake care...\n\nLove Diane\n\n**\nbarefoot\n**\nTo: buggerlugs\nSubj: remember you!!\n\nDate: Jul  5\n\nHi Sharon,\nof course I do remember you.  Although its a long time ago I last saw you\non here.  But I disappeared for a while as well, and Im not really\nmudding anymore.  Since Im not at the university, being on here got quite\nexpensive.  Usually I just come here to see who is on, and I hardly ever\nmeet anyone I know, so its great to see you are back.\nI can imagine that it wasnt easy to leave home.    Some time ago I almost did the same.\nBut now I guess Im glad I didnt.  Oh well, maybe if I find the proper\nwoman... :)\nIll write again.  Or talk to you on here.  Take care.\n*HUGS*\nRalf\n\n**\ntrillien\n**\nTo: buggerlugs\nSubj: .\n\nDate: Jul  7\n\nHi Sharon !\n\nGuess why I've not been on for a few days ????  Yep Daves been playing around\nagain and lost telnet for a few days.....what a surprise !!\nHopefully he has learnt his lesson by now !\nWe went through to Glasgow yesterday with Dave and Shelia and got the wallpaper\nfor the nursery. We went to see Davids dad tonight and hes coming at the\nweekend to put it up for us ... I can't wait to see it done !\nWe were away buying more things for junior during the week ....more clothes,\nnappy bin and other bits and pieces so the house is getting cluttered..we\ncan hardly move in our bedroom at the mo so thats another reason why I can'\nwait til the nursery is finished so I can move in here again !!\n\nI'm having a dilema at work at the mo...the doctor has offered to sign me off \nwork as she says that the shift work is no good for me and I shouldn't be doing it so my boss said she would try to change my shifts for me....but then I get \na phone call today to say shes put me back to the way it was before....I knew\nit was too good to  be true...I'm going to give her til next week and if she\ndoes the same again I#m just going to get signed off....some things are more\nimportant. I can leave on the 29th August and stil get my full maternity pay\nso it looks like thats the latest I'll be there....I'd originally planned\nstayong on til september but bugger that !!\n\nWe got the mail from Rufus...what a guy asking if we can make it on that date !\nWho knows what we will all be doing that time next year !!!\nDo you think you will be able to make it over for the wedding ?\nDave and I will be going no matter what date it is as I'll not be working and \nDave can suit himself what holidays he takes.\n\nI've got a pile of ironing that can reach the ceiling so thats going to be\nmy night !!  What an exciting life I lead !!\nDaves probably going to playing his new games...one of them is called Redneck\nRampage and he thinks it excellent !\nTalk to you soon,\nTake care\nLove Diane\n\n**\ntrillien\n**\nTo: buggerlugs\nSubj: Email\n\nDate: Jul 16\n\nHiya hon\nCan you send me an email so I can get your address...Dave has finally\nfinished mucking about and we now have Pegasus mail but I haven't\ngot your email anymore...one of the many things that got wiped  :)\n\nSo how you keeping ??  Why you looking for a new job ?? I thought you\nwere happy in the job you have at the mo...\nWe were told today that it looks seriously like the hotel going to get sold\nnow so we all just have to wait and see if we get to keep our jobs....\nit could screw it up for me with my maternity leave....\n\nHow did Seans party go ??  Did you phone ??? I bet it was abit tearful\nspeaking to all your family...not to mention expensive !\nDo you see much of Bills family these days ?? Or are you two enjoying \nyour own space too much at the mo !!\n\nNot much been happening here lately...Davids just getting fatter by the day !\nTrying too hard to keep up with me....I'm seriously getting left behind !\nHes in the middle of decorating the spare room this week...its starting\nto look good ..I can't wait til its finished and I can get the place\ncleaned up abit...typical guy gets everywhere messy !!\n\nI've finally discovered a shop where I can get clothes to fit !! I never\nthought of it before..Evans...I have been hunting everywhere to try to\nget underwear to fit me these days...its scarey how big certain parts of\nyour anatomy get when your pregnant....*GRIN*...no wonder you get back ache !!\nI didn't have time to buy anything today which pleased David but...... I\nmight have to have a look tomorrow before I start work as I'm on a later shift\nDavid panics every time I get near shops......especially if it has anything\nto do with babies  :)\n\nDavids been slagging me off for buying baby magazines lately.....but I caught\nhim out the other day...hes a closet baby magazine reader...I thought they\nhad been mysteriousy moving from room to room and that he was becoming very\nknowledgeable on all the facts....then I caught him red handed and he had\nto own up !!  Although he was abit shocked at how graphic some of the pics\nwere and some articles were abit too detailed especially when it came to\nthe birth part !  Its true though...when you see that girlie mags are on the top shelf\nand then these baby mags are available to anyone and are far more graphic...\neven I find it difficult looking at then without crossing my legs !!\nI just don't want to think about that part at the mo...I'll wait til it happens.\n\nWell its 12.30 and time for me to hit the hay...Davids waiting not so patiently to get on\nto play redneck rampage...he loves the game....I'm not so sure....its Quake/\nDoom in hicky land..the sound efects get abit annoying after bit.\nTake care\n\nLove Diane\n& Dave\n\n**\ntrillien\n**\nTo: buggerlugs\nSubj: its me again !\n\nDate: Jul 16\n\nps can you send me Rufus's email address too...\nThanks !!\n\nDiane\n\n**\nhakan\n**\nTo: buggerlugs\nSubj: hello!\nDate: Sep  3\n\nHiya and how's everything...\nJust passing through here and thought I'd drop you a line.\nTake care...\nue/hakan\n\n**\nhakan\n**\nTo: buggerlugs\nSubj: autumn\nDate: Sep  5\n\nhello Sharon,\nYes autumn is my favorite time of year too, and for it to arrive so suddenly was terrific!!!  Although of course, now I have to listen to people at work who actually think it's COLD!!!!  *grins*\nYes, the Princess' death was a real shocker....I'm amazed at the public show of grief not only in England but all across the country here as well.  I think that what a lot of people here are especially interested in, is watching the House of Windsor cope (or attempt to) changine expectations of them by the public!!\nFor sure, I'll be amongst those people who get up at the crack of dawn on Saturdy to watch the funeral....I do have to admit that European royalty DO know how to present the pomp and ritual of such occasions.\nTell Bill hi, and hope that all is well with the two of you!\nHugs from Sue\n\n**\n"
