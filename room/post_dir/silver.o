Everyone here in New Jersey is doing all right.  Even Cathi, who just moved to a new apartment in New York this weekend.  And Peter is doing all right at college.\nAnd what's up with you?\nI'm just finishing a week's vacation and will be back to work tomorrow night...too bad, as I've really enjoyed being at home with nothing to do!\nHope to hear from you soon....\nSue\n\n**\n"
