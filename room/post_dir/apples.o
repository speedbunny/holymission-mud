It is 1:09 am here and all...and was it joyful that you said is your sister? I have you phone number then and Cindy, maybe that is Saffrin, that's the only Cindy I know. The letter is on here and it's from March 1rst. Both area codes are the same (603 I think) and the prefixes are the same, I think they are 463. But don't hold me to that. I don't want to scroll back up and read it again. Ok, I guess I'm gonna take off now, although I'm not that tired for some reason...take care and keep it real.\nCraig\n\n**\nbeukeboom\n**\nTo: apples\nSubj: hola\nDate: Jan  8\n\nI'm not sure if I have your number?
