A few days ago it was Sargon.  Time before\nthat it was another while before that, a whole nother person.\n\nAnd to think one night ~you~ went paranoid when you left and I decided\nto talk to another female.  Fucking hypocritical to me...\n\nSo go spread yourself out or whatever you said.  And don't bother your-\nself with me.  I'm tired of having to always make the first move to\nwrite to you here or via e-mail or whatever.  I do not need one-sided\nfriendships like you.\n\nDon't ask about any snail mail.\n  - me...\n\n**\ntuppence\n**\nTo: vincent\nSubj: boo!\nDate: Oct 31\n\npeek a boo hello =)\nhow ya doing havent seen ya in a few days\ni havent been doing much dont log on much anymore =)\nhuggles\n\n**\n"
