Has a quest, and some very good \nroom descs, so I think all it is missing is some organization and\nproof reading/bug checking.  Maybe some replace_rpogram and such\nto make it all nice. :)\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: iishima\nSubj: Area\nDate: Aug 23\n\nExos informed me that you still haven't finished strict typing some of the\nfiles in your area (specifically the non-room files). He also said\nthat some of the rooms could do with more items to look at and give\ninformation in...\n\nLet me know what you think, and when you finish the strict typing...\n\nSauron\n\n**\nexos\n**\nTo: iishima\nSubj: area\nCc: sauron\nDate: Aug 27\n\nHow's the area coming along, Iish?\n\nExos\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: iishima\nSubj: area\nDate: Aug 28\n\nI started to look through your rooms again, and came up against a rather\nlarge problem - formatting! You have no indentation or organisation\nin your room code...\n\nYou also block the calling of ::reset() if the arg==1... not good. It would\nbe better if you used if(!arg) { } around your initialisatin code...\nYou also don't need to set the light level to 2 - 1 is enough.\n\nLet me know when you get these things sorted, and I'll take another look.\n\nDave (aka Sauron)\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: iishima\n Re:   Sup DaveDate: Aug 31\n\nWho gave you the example? Not me I hope... :)\n\nI have a sample room I wrote for Thumper in ~sauron/mentor/ if you want to\nsee how I write basic rooms... If you want to idndent more, that fine,\nbut you should indent at least 2-3 spaces for clarity...\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: iishima\nSubj: mentee room\nCc: mentees\nDate: Sep  9\n\nJust to let you know that I changed the path of the mentee room. It's now:\n/players/sauron/room/mentor/menteeRoom.\n\nEnjoy\nSauron\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: iishima\nSubj: mentee room\nCc: mentees\nDate: Sep 11\n\nSome (one at least) of you still seem to be trying to access the room\nat it's old location of /players/sauron/room/menteeRoom... It has moved to\n/players/sauron/room/mentor/menteeRoom.\n\nJust to let you all know - Mangla was hassling me about the line that\nappears in the lpmud.log whenever you try to access a non-existent room.\n\nDave\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: iishima\nSubj: menteeRoom again\nCc: mentees\nDate: Sep 18\n\nIt's moved again - /players/sauron/mentor/room/menteeRoom. :)\n\nDave\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: iishima\nSubj: area\nCc: sauron\nDate: Apr 25\n\nNeed to remove the indentations in the descs, and use indentation\nin your code. Then it will be nicer to look at and can be checked\nagain.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: iishima\nRe:   Hi\nDate: Sep 25\n\nHi Peanut!\n\nDrop me a line sometime at saffrin@geocities.com or\ncardinalc@valleycottage.lhric.org\n\nI am now the sysop for an elementary school.
