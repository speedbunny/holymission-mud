That was not grounds for a PK.  However,\nit is a violation of the thief code, no matter how annoying\nany of us are, we are thieves, and we stick together.  Period.\nI am marking one note against both of you, if either of you break \nthe code again, one of the thief guides will deal with you accordingly\nIn theory, i should take action against you already since you already\nhave one mark against you for violating the code in regards to the \nhideout, however, since you were a newbie then, i will do nothing.\nIf you follow the code and respect your fellow thieves, there should\nbe no problems.  However, if you break the code again, you will be\ndealt with summarily.\n\nStiletto, Thief Guide\n\n**\ndaniella\n**\nTo: circe\nRe:   Hey\nDate: Apr  5\n\nhey you...long time no see.\ncourt went fine, we got it all worked out in a pretty amicable way.  i was\nsatisfied.  i have a horrible urge to dig $100 out of somewhere and buy\ncds.  ill never do it, of course, but im having fun thinking of which ones\nid buy.  :)  \nahhh, the bright smiley dani is around here somewhere, i think ill\nfind her soon....\nlove\ndani\nxoxo\n\n**\n"
