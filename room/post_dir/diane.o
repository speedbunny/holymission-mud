It will wear off\nas other spells do.  \n\n2. unsheep - see sheep ;)  \n    - another mage can rescue a victim of sheep by casting\nunsheep on them.\n\n3.  distant fire - with this spell a mage can blast a monster with \nfire through another player's eyes.  This is a high level spell and\nhas a very bad chance of working, but when it does it hits hard.\n\n4.  whirlwind - an offensive spell that is similar to fireball that\ncauses high damage with the winds.\n\n5. curse/uncurse - any annoying spell for the mischievous mage\nto cast on anyone harassing them (exmaples: bard's sletzer\nthieves mud)  Although it causes no damage it is rather annoying\nand spammy.  This will make the victim babble and look crazy \nto the room they are in.  Uncurse is to lift it.\n\n6. slow - to reduce the hits per round by a given monster.  should\nbe limited to a certain number of rounds.  (example: level/4 rounds)\n\n7. bloodlust - makes the monsters in the room attack each other\n\n8. mana drain - after the monster is dead a mage can mana drain corpse\nto heal slightly.  The heal should be in ratio to the leve\nmonster.  *this has been requested by mages*\n\n9. mage tell - gotta come up with one soon, have any ideas, want\nto have something orginal, too many damn birds flying around with\ntells for people *grin*  Something like a firefly or a kelpie or\nsomething, firefly is cute :)\n\nDamn, I had a few more ideas I cant remember, them, will mail\nmore when they come to me.\n\nSaff\n\nPS say hi to shell for me and tell her that her card rocked!!!\n\n**\n"
