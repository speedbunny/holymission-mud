My best friend's family fell apart right before her eyes...\nher father is in florida now, she's staying with her bf's family, her one\nbrother is staying with family friends, the other is bouncing from apt\nto apt in NYC, and hermother is at the house, alone...I finally got my car\ninspected and pass..got new tires and a tune-up which cost me about $500.\nI have no money left to buy xmas gift, but that is a way off and im \nworking like crazy so that's fine. Exos and i are still 'talking', or \nwhateverr you want to call it...but there is this guy at the mall \ni work at that i've had a crush on for the past 2 yrs. So now i feel \nguilty for checking him out, that's just my silly mind going though. (donll anyone though)-my friends here are going crazy and losing their bars..\ni havent been able to talk to anyone cause no one is around when i get on \nhere. \nthere has been so much more but, i'm going crazy now just thinking about it\noh yeah, to top things all off I still have figleafs daughters b-day pres\nin my room waiting to be sent. Im sure now they hate me and think im a lier,\nbut hey, at this point i dont care. I need to do laundry before i go running\naroung today.\nWell i hope to talk to you soon dear. Stay safe.\nlots of love\nKarissa\n\nPs oh yeah to top it all off, yest morning before going into work, I got \na flat tire...one of my new ones :(---you just gotta laugh at all this, i do\nor atleast i try to. Ill see you soon.\n\n**\ncopperhead\n**\nTo: manfred\nSubj: Something\nCc: relgar, tuppence, tetsuhara, izekiel, baer, tas, amethyst, redsexy, quazar\nDate: Dec  3\n\n                                     ,.
