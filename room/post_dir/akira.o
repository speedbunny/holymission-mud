I wanted to make this request of all \nof you.  I am sorry if i could not included everyone as I brought up\nmost of your names from memory.\n      I was removed banished because Herp was told on the wizline \nby Leslie that It was me who had altered his prison file.\nLeslie said this because i was mentioning the abuse of the\nprison file earlier that day.  I have made almost no attempt\nto reinstate my self in the last few months but I am coming\nto the point where I really miss being here and talking with most\nof you.  When I was here I made a difference.  I want to do so again\nMy life has settled down and I am no longer in transition.  I hold\nthe postion of General Manager and Partner of Hawk Manufactured Housing\nbased in Warren PA and have recently opened the 5th Sanchin Karate Academy \nthere.  But anyway.\nI have sent mail to Herp explaning everything that transpired and trying\nto clear up the whole mess.  I need support.\nI would like to ask each and every one of you to mail a short message\nto Herp.  Say what you can.  If only that you believe what happened \nwas a mistake and you would like to see Tatsuo unbanished.\nI am counting on each one of you.

I have layed out many reasons why i want to be arch\nand i am consistantly put off and ignored.  The arches want to do everything behind \nclosed doors.  I am sending this letter to Mangla, who of all the arches, is the\nonly one that codes, and has been here, and who has admittedly pointed out that\nhe forgets things, and misses things, because of everything that needs done.\n\nCoding for HM is something that I enjoy to the fullest, but it has not been fun.\nAt every turn I have an archwizard speaking down at me, lying about me or at\nleast continuing an untrue rumor to others, THIS IS LOGGED, I have sent it to \nmangla.  We have archwizards who last coded 5 years ago.  We have archwizards\nwith outside commitments that take up space here.  We have archwizards that\ntake off 5 months and turn up like messiahs reasserting their rightful positions\nand casting down judgements. And we have one coding arch.\n\nFor 3 and one half years I watched the mud go through death throws, as players\nand wizards were driven off by shitty policies, guild closings, and the mud\nbeing moved around( all reasons I have heard).  Sauron, of the beloved\nninja guild had 3.5 years to recode ninja, he also had 3.5 years to\nput the monk into a bin system, and do something to balance it.  It just wasn't\ndone.  I do not know what he has done, but i can only speak of what wasn't done,\nand ask if opening and fixing these guilds was less important that what was done.\n\nThere was plenty of time for these people to \"shit or get off the pot\".\nIt wasn't done.  For those of you who do not know, or who have prescribed to\nthe rumors that abound.  I was banned by mistake.  I was kept away and put\noff without reason.  Untrustworty was heard. All sorts of things.\nFor the brief time i was unbanned, i was NEVER returned to my position,\nalthough it was a mistake that i lost it.  I was kept and treated as\na wiz with suspicion, and comments being made about me.  It sucked.\n\nI was restored to my position.  Airborne said it was a check on Mangla.\nMangla said it was to bring back HM.  Silas voted for me cause i asked him.\nIn the time that i made elder, I restored the ninja with wilbie, tinman,\nand bobo, restored the summoners with redsexy.  recruited and set up\n7 new Gm's, reviewed and opened 5 areas, coded a clan system, and fixed\n2 whole areas.  There is much more that needs done.  And i log on every\nday to find some social archwizard speaking down from above.  Or active\nones talking down about me or to me.  Telling me what is wrong with me, \nand refusing to listen to all the facts established about what is wrong\nwith what they have done.  I have done archwizard work.  I was an archwizard.\nI have used elder position to help everyone on here, even the assholes.\n\nMany other wizards have been inspired to come back, but that momentum is dying.\nThey have been put off, forgotten, while the ALL important archwizards\nsit back for a month to discuss things.  Redsexy was ignored for a year.\nHer area forgotten.  Bobo has done more coding than any other person\nat his rank, he is ignored and put off.  I don't blame him for cutting back.\nThere are wizards that are banished and wanted to come back, but they are\nignored.  And Exos is still here even after the testimony of 7 or 8 people\nattested to his absolute wrongdoings.\n\nAfter the ninja guild was restored, players and wizards started calling for\nnew archwizards with my name being mentioned many times.  These people were\ntold point blank to shut the hell up.  I have no conception of what\nyou arches have going on in that little room, and what bullshit ideas are\nfloating around.  But face it. One coding arch, isn't going to cut it.\nThe mud blew up in sargons workroom, understandings were reached, Then ignored.\nThat Tuesday came and went a month ago.  The old ways are no longer needed.\nWho is gonna help you put in the 100 level system? Airborne? Silas?\nKryll?, maybe Warlord and Uglymoth.  Maybe Sauron when he comes back from\nhis next extended vacation.  Hello, Tatsuo has the ability, and has shown it.\nThe mantras of me being some evil son of a bitch won't work forever when\nthey are demonstrably untrue.  You know what Redsexy is right, I am BOTH.\n\nI cannot fathom the resistance to the move when everything points to a positive.\nWhen there is a chance to remove the dead weight and move up the people\nthat are bringing back the players.  The momentum as you put it is starting to slip\nwith the players.  I can spark it back up.  I will claim responsibility\nfor a large percent of the comeback that is started.  I give the rest to the\npeople who have been ignored and put off.  From what i know, there are\npotentially 3 mudlib level coders on the game besides you Mangla.\nThose are your archwizards.\nTatsuo, Wilbie, and Sargon.\n\nPlease stop bogarting the highest position in the game when others can fill \nthose positions.  calling kryll to login hasn't made him come back and fix the\nplace. and saurons instant appearance also has done little but piss me off.\nPut the level where the level belongs.  With the people that code this place,\nand enjoy it.\n\nYou want the 100 level system in, arch those people.\nYou want the guilds running and balanced, arch those people.\nYou want players coming back, arch those people.\nYou want new players, arch those people.\nYou want wizards coding and being helped with code, arch those people.\nYou want Holy Mission back, arch those people.\n\nIf you want things the way they were. Sit back and dicuss things some more with\nthe deadbeats that brought her down.\nMake some changes, shake the boat. Take action, make it fun.\nIf not, I am outta here.  \n\nI have forwarded this to every wiz that gives a damn, and i will ask that\nthese wizzes write their feelings to MANGLA and cc it to TATSUO.  I want\na clean and open debate.  I also ask that it not be sent to other arches\nwhose feelings may be hurt by it.  That is not my intention.  I i have\nspoken an untruth, let it be known.  If i am right, tell mangla to fix the\nplace.\n\nTatsuo, for Holy Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: redsexy\nFwd:  Tatsuo / Archwiz\nCc: sargon, akira, uruz, waldo, wilbie, bobo, tinman, widge, icehouse, ati\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo / Archwiz\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nWell I'm only a beginner, and actually this is the 1st MUD i've ever been on. And I may not know much about what all the details are, but I can say that Tatsuo is someone on here who I could immediately tell that he knew what he was doing.\nWhen there was a bug, Tatsuo fixes it. When we bump into each other, he converses with me. I constantly see him on here and he has never EVER said anything like \"Well hold on. I'm busy.\"\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding. But once I met people like Tatsuo and Redsexy who were this friendly, I haven't even tried one of the other 500 muds on this list of mine. That should show how attractive this place is. And if all the other Archwizzes made it what it is today, I'm sure those two can help make it what it will be tomorrow.\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding.

And people who lack the\nresponsibility should be taken off arch immediately.  Once people see\nhow great hm was and what it really was.  I can even say i left hm because\nof lack of work being done and no one gives a damn about the mud but Tatsuo\ncan make a difference.  He made me realized the mud can change.  Therefore\ni have help him with the ninja guild.  He show me many things that can\nbe added to improve hm.  I say why don't we just give tatsuo a try.  \nare you afraid of him??  if so, you can watch him and see his ability\nto work. you will find your suspiouicans are wrong.  This mud will die\nagain and make all the people here lost hope if nothing is being done.\nI have talk to a few people about hm.  they say the arch doesn't care\nabout the mud anymore and at the moment they have saw tatsuo making\nchanges which made people come back.  and actually take a look at this place.\nLet us not neglect hm again.  Give Tatsuo the arch position.\n\nTinman\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: this arch stuff\nCc: sargon, akira, uruz, tatsuo, bobo, tinman, redsexy, airborne\nDate: Mar 22\n\nLeaving all personal issues aside, and leaving all political bullshit aside,\nI think Tatsuo and the others who have spoken up have some good points.\nWhether that means new arches or just new roles for lower levels, the fact\nremains that we need change.\n\nRight now we have one active arch.  In order to accomplish everything that \nneeds to be done here, that just won't do.  We either need new arches or the\narches need to pass on some roles to the elders.  It's very simple.\n\nThis is not a rip on Airborne, or any other arch.  Actually, let me rephrase\nthat part...  This is not a rip on Airborne, but it IS a rip on the others.\nAirborne still logs in, and he still makes a visible effort.  But the fact\nremains that Mangla is the only arch who plays a primary role in Holy Mission.\nMangla makes the decisions.  Mangla makes the policy.  Airborne acts as sort\nof a check - just to keep things balanced.\n\nAs for the other arches, how in the hell can a person be considered an arch\nwhen they never log on and do anything?  Popping in now and then to vote on\nsomething that you don't even care about doesn't count.\n\nThis is also not a rip on Mangla.  Personally, I have no problem with Mangla.\nThe problem I have is that Mangla (purposely or not) has placed the entire\nMud on his shoulders.  One person just doesn't cut it.  It doesn't matter if\nyou have the best intentions in the world.  One person does not make a mud.\n\nPersonally, I think Tatsuo would make a very good arch.  Quite frankly, I \nthink a great number of the people we have right now would make great arches.\nLet's stop thinking of the \"arch\" position as some elite rank.  It's just \nanother level with more work involved.  If someone has the ability, and the\ndesire, they should be given the opportunity to do the work.  \n\nThey certainly have more business with that rank than someone who never\nlogs in.\n\nOne last thing, for the record.  I don't want to be an arch.  If raising my\nlevel will help me help this mud then yes, I'm all for promotion.  Promote\nme to whatever I can best help you with.  To me, that's all rank is.  It's\naccess to do more good for the Mud.\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: Strike\nCc: sargon, shadowmonk, nae, bobo, nunu, turbo, tinman, thumper, akira, nylakoorub\nDate: Mar 27\n\nI propose a coding strike, to let the arches know that we are not going to\nput up with their shit anymore.  They have had THREE YEARS to get this mud\nback together, and so far they've failed miserably.  Furthermore, they've\nallowed personal vandettas to hinder the progress of the mud.\n\nI suggest the following conditions to begin coding again:\n\n1.  Reinstate Tatsuo.  That's a given.  He's done more for this mud in a\n    month than all of the arches did in three years.\n\n2.  Demote ALL inactive arches.  Kryll, Magnal, Sauron, Airborne.  These four\n    have done nothing for three years.  Sauron has been \"working on the lib\",\n    Airborne comes in to read boards, and Kryll hasn't done shit.  As for\n    Magnal - who the hell is Magnal?  \n\n3.  Mangla must either step down from arch or promote at\n    LEAST one more arch in order to balance the power.\n\nIf you agree to this, post it.  If not, do whatever you like.  Personally,\nI don't see the point of having the mud if things stay as they are.\n\n\n**\nnae\n**\nTo: wilbie\nRe:   Strike\nCc: redsext, sargon, shadowmonk, nae, bobo, nunu, turbo, tinman, thumper, akira, nylakoorub\nDate: Mar 27\n\njesus christ, this is such crap. \ni'm sorry, i try to stay out of politics, but tatsuo has\nmanaged to brainwash people. so here's the deal, as far\nas i'm concerned.\n\ni'm gonna keep doing what i'm doing. coding, enjoying the\nmud. it's a GAME!!!!!!! i have fun here.\n\nif you want to leave, then be my guest... *shurg* but\na strike???

The point was to\nshow the arches that we're united.  But I guess we're not.  I guess only a\nfew of us give a rat's ass that the mud is falling apart.\n\nNae - I agree, this is only a game.  It's supposed to be a fun game.  But \nI'll tell you what Nae...  After you've spent the time coding hundreds of\nrooms, items, and monsters, and after you've spend the time testing and \nrecoding a few guilds - only to have it mean NOTHING because a couple \narchwizards decide to play dictator - you tell me you're not a little \npissed about it.  You listen to three years of bullshit and tell me you're\nnot frustrated.  \n\nAt the very least, I would have at least expected a litte consideration from\nyou.  I thought we were friends - my mistake.\n\nAs for the rest of you, I'll say it again.  It's your mud...  if you want it,\nyou've gotta take it.\n\nThere's a good chance that I'll be banished soon - it's how our arches deal\nwith us \"subversive\" types.  If I am, have a good one.

Try\nexamining the items in your rooms and you will see a \"double period\" at\nthe end of each one.\n\nHopefully talk to you here soon.\n\nRed\n\n**\n"
