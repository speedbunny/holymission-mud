Gee it's really good to hear from you again!\nI've been wondering where you've been hiding yourself!\nSo how are things? Everything is going ok here so far.\nI have finished school, but I haven't managed to get any work in\na school yet. It's really a pain.\nOne thing I have managed to score is a job teaching internet for a local\ninternet provider. I get $35 an hour, but usually only 3 hours per week :(\nAt this rate, my planned US tour is going to take a while to save up for.\nYou can see everything that's been happening to me on my homepage.\nhttp://members.tripod.com/~peraphon/\nMy email address is pcalder@ix.net.au\nHope to hear from you real soon!!!\nMuch love,\nPete.\n\n**\nperaphon\n**\nTo: airel\nRe:   me\nDate: Dec  2\n\nhey!!!\nhow ya going?\nThat account should be dead and buried.
