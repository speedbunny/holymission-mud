You're such a sweetheart, and no matter how much I try...oh hell...no more whining.  I don't know how often you're on here, but they purged the mail and all the addresses that I neglected to write down were erased, so I don't have your most recent address that you left here for me, but I do have the old one...\nThere's just no excuse for me, right?  *HUG*  AH well...tell you what...I just went on vacation and wen't totally camera happy...so give me your address and I'll send you recent pictures of me on the beach *woo hoo* and me and my honey.  (Yep, still the same guy I took to your wedding...go figure :) )\n\nOPEFULLY I'll hear from you soon...\n\nTake care and give James a big hi and a hug from me.\n\nLove you, \nChrista\n\n**\nroxanne\n**\nTo: avery\nSubj: I wish I could talk to you!!!\n\nDate: Aug 30\n\nI wish I wasn't such a schmuck to lose your address, but I have to tell you....\n\nI'M ENGAGED!!!!!  *cheer*  *blush*  *scream*  *jump*  (pandemonium.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[D.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C.[C) :)\n\nI wish I could talk to you, or get in touch with you some way besides on here.  \nWe've set a date for August 30, next year.  Keep it in mind ;)\n\nI hope I hear from you soon...I miss sharing fun, exciting news with you.  :)\n\nOh, and yeah, it's Rob ;)\n\n\nI love you, \n\nChrista\n\n**\n"
