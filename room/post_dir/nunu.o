messages "guest\n**\nTo: nunu\nSubj: greetings\nCc: akira\nDate: Jan 22\n\n\nHello old Friend\n\nTatsuo here.\n\nYou can find me at Realmsmud\nI am known as Gildamor there.\n\nrealms.dorsai.org 1501\nif i'm not there, leave a message with anyone, everyone knows me.\n\nGildamor, aka Tatsuo.\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: redsexy\nSubj: Strike\nCc: sargon, shadowmonk, nae, bobo, nunu, turbo, tinman, thumper, akira, nylakoorub\nDate: Mar 27\n\nI propose a coding strike, to let the arches know that we are not going to\nput up with their shit anymore.  They have had THREE YEARS to get this mud\nback together, and so far they've failed miserably.  Furthermore, they've\nallowed personal vandettas to hinder the progress of the mud.\n\nI suggest the following conditions to begin coding again:\n\n1.  Reinstate Tatsuo.  That's a given.  He's done more for this mud in a\n    month than all of the arches did in three years.\n\n2.  Demote ALL inactive arches.  Kryll, Magnal, Sauron, Airborne.  These four\n    have done nothing for three years.  Sauron has been \"working on the lib\",\n    Airborne comes in to read boards, and Kryll hasn't done shit.  As for\n    Magnal - who the hell is Magnal?  \n\n3.  Mangla must either step down from arch or promote at\n    LEAST one more arch in order to balance the power.\n\nIf you agree to this, post it.  If not, do whatever you like.  Personally,\nI don't see the point of having the mud if things stay as they are.\n\n\n**\nnae\n**\nTo: wilbie\nRe:   Strike\nCc: redsext, sargon, shadowmonk, nae, bobo, nunu, turbo, tinman, thumper, akira, nylakoorub\nDate: Mar 27\n\njesus christ, this is such crap. \ni'm sorry, i try to stay out of politics, but tatsuo has\nmanaged to brainwash people. so here's the deal, as far\nas i'm concerned.\n\ni'm gonna keep doing what i'm doing. coding, enjoying the\nmud. it's a GAME!!!!!!! i have fun here.\n\nif you want to leave, then be my guest... *shurg* but\na strike??? WHO FUCKING CARES????\n\njesus, maybe i shouldnt mail when i'm drunk. but this is just\nsuch crap... whining about shit that tatsuo obviously has no clue about.\n\nwilbie, and whoever else supports this strike... i have a suggestion for\nya- go on strike. turn off your machine, get out into the world,\nand realize that there's more to it than this game. cause\nthis game doesnt mean a damn thing.\n\nnae\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: akira\nSubj: strike\nCc: nae, turbo, bobo, nunu, redsexy\nDate: Mar 29\n\nThe whole point of the strike was not to stop the mud.  The point was to\nshow the arches that we're united.  But I guess we're not.  I guess only a\nfew of us give a rat's ass that the mud is falling apart.\n\nNae - I agree, this is only a game.  It's supposed to be a fun game.  But \nI'll tell you what Nae...  After you've spent the time coding hundreds of\nrooms, items, and monsters, and after you've spend the time testing and \nrecoding a few guilds - only to have it mean NOTHING because a couple \narchwizards decide to play dictator - you tell me you're not a little \npissed about it.  You listen to three years of bullshit and tell me you're\nnot frustrated.  \n\nAt the very least, I would have at least expected a litte consideration from\nyou.  I thought we were friends - my mistake.\n\nAs for the rest of you, I'll say it again.  It's your mud...  if you want it,\nyou've gotta take it.\n\nThere's a good chance that I'll be banished soon - it's how our arches deal\nwith us \"subversive\" types.  If I am, have a good one.  I hope the best for\nHoly Mission and for all of you.  \n\nWilbie\ncphite@lightstream.net\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: turbo\nSubj: stuff\nCc: bobo, akira, redsexy, tuppence, nunu\nDate: Mar 29\n\nIf anyone wants to keep in touch, please send me an email\nat the following:\n\ncphite@lightstream.net\n\nInclude your ICQ number and nickname if you have one (if you don't have\nICQ you should get it - you'll like it)...\n\nThanks.\n\n**\nnae\n**\nTo: wilbie\nRe:   strike\nCc: nae, turbo, bobo, nunu, redsexy, akira\nDate: Mar 30\n\nYes, we ARE friends. But I'm sorry, I'm not a sheep.\n*I* don't agree with you that the arches are dictators.\n*I* dont agree that they're ruining the mud.\nI happen to think that the best way we can make the\nmud better is to all work together... which is CLEARLY\nnot what you were asking for.\n\nI'm sorry. If you open a discussion, and call for\nresponses, dont act like it's the end of the world\nwhen they dont agree with you.\n\n**\n"
