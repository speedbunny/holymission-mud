Specially to get\nthat damned 'visiting wizard' crap outta my 'thief'. But mostly so I\ncan be a part of the improvement and advancement of our guild. I have\nmany ideas and can help incorporate the ideas of our fellow players.\n\nI believe you know me fairly well, especially as Evil, and I hope our\nlevel of trust as seasoned thieves will extend to a great partnership.\nI will offer my services to you and anything you need for me to code,\nI will handle it to the best of my ability. \n\nAs a player in the thieves guild, for many years in fact, has made me\nlearn to covet and love this guild.That was the reason for my request to\nbecome a thief Guide and to be an active part of the guild. Now my reason\nfor becoming wiz is soley\nbecause I want to better my efforts to helping the guild and making it\nfiner than it is now.\n\nWell hopefully I'll see you on sometime. *bow*\n\n  Septian, the Angel of Death\n\n\n**\nmajik\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: guild\n\nCc: \nDate: Mar 30\n\ncan you implement being able to use other guild skills again.\nonly legends would know about it but that was cool and a sneaky thing:)\njust asking....in case you didn't know, most guilds took that\npower away from us:(\nthanks:)\nMajik\n**\n\n**\nhaplo\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: Voice command\n\nCc: airborne,sauron\nDate: Apr  8\n\nHiya blade, I temporarily removed voice from operation as It appears Stilleto\nis causing massive problems with it.

Now will not fill up error logs. :)\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nredsexy\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: Hideout\nDate: Nov 19\n\nHi,\n\nJust logged in after the reboot and the thieves hideout was bugged.\nIt just said \"You see nothing special\" as you looked around, etc.\nand no room description on entry.\n\nWhen I updated the room it went back to normal (this was three minutes after reboot\nso no worries about players stuff being in there) but it could be worth keeping\nan eye on.\n\nJust to let ya know.\n\nRed\n\n**\nstiletto\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: Thief guide\nCc: l\nDate: Nov 21\n\nI am a little confused as to why i lost my thief guide status.\nAll i did was ask sauron to fix picklock.  Llisa said something\nlike i fucked with disguise.  I am not the one that reported that,\ni have been using it as it still works despite the error message.\nYou might want to talk to paranoi or the arches, i think that it\nwas reporting enough errors in the log where they fixed it.\n\nI asked for picklock to be fixed because i was stuck in a room where\nthat was one of the ways i could get out (and in doing so, do\na quest).  And no, sneak would not have worked.\n\nWhy dont you try talking to me next time.  What the fuck is up\nwith that.\n\nStiletto\n\n**\nparanoi\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: droping panther in hideout\nDate: Nov 25\n\ni have experienced problems when i dropen panther in hideout.\nit says i cycles panther pands outt, panther was moved to the, until i didnt\nbackstab it\n\nthanx for repairing Para\n\n**\nstiletto\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: Steal\nDate: Dec  4\n\nsomeone fucked with steal hardcore\nThere is now a message to the person we steal from, no matter whether or\nnot we succeed in stealing or if we fail.  Please fix that, it puts the\nthief lives in danger when they should not be =-)\n\n\n**\nredlego\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: CIRCE\nCc: **\nDate: Dec 11\n\nOk pretend I am circe... I didint feel liek signing her on.\nSttiletto pissed me off so i took shit from the hideout threatening,\nbut paranoi (my hubby)  knew I wasnt, and that I was gonna give it to him, another thief.  So Stiletto banished me from the guild.  i dont think thats fair\nbecause i did nothing wrong.   I nevere junked a thing from the hideout as Circe.  Please put me back as a memeber of the guild.   You cant talk to stiletto because he is banished :)**\n\n**\ncirce\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: hideout\nDate: Dec 12\n\nStiletto banished me fromt he hideout for no reason....\nHe had PKed lego so i signed on Circe, went inot the hideout and got\nall i could carry, then gave it to paranoi teasing stiletto \nthat i had junked it all which I hadnt.  I told stiletto the truth\nand Paranoi justified it and he said to mail ypu and ask\nto be let back inot the hideout because I had done nothing worng.\n\nStuiletto acted too quickly.... I didnt junk a thing and I\nwould actually like to play now with Circe because all thge thiueves are now bening banished or erased.  Please let me back in because I didnt do\nanything worng.\n\n\nJamie**\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: backstab errors\nDate: Dec 12\n\nI reformatted the layout of the PK log last night to give more info, and\nhence made a small change to the log made by backstab, but I introduced an\nerror when thieves backstab monsters, which I just fixed. Hence you can\nignore all the backstab errors in the logs if anyone mentions them to you. :)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions...\nSauron\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: odd\nCc: sauron, blade\nDate: Dec 13\n\nMy goddess has a death shout that names the player and guild of the one\nwho killed it.  It does all the guilds correctly except for Thief.\nIs this a problem of the thief guild?  A thief killing it is called \nan adventurer by the shout.  \n\nAlso, if I do an mguild adventurer when I'm a thief, it says I'm already\nin the adventurers guild.  \n\nPlease let me know how I can fix this :)\nWilbie\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: wilbie\nSubj: Thief problem fixed\nCc: blade, sauron, kryll\nDate: Dec 13\n\nThe thief soul declared the disguise variable, but never set its\ninitial value to 1 instead of 0 so that when you query guild\non a thief, it would default to adventurer. I just added an initial\nstatement in the reset that makes the variable 1 at clone time.\nThis should fix your problem.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: thanks, but...\nCc: blade\nDate: Dec 14\n\nI was talking to Uglymouth about the problem, and he found the\ndisguise variable as well.  But he also made a good point that \nthe thief killing the thing might not WANT to be found out.\nNot wanting to over-ride Blade's disguise feature, I was thinking\nof maybe having it somehow query the guild they are disguised as.\nBut I'd need a little help (from Blade maybe) since I'm not\nsure how...\n\nLet me know what you think about this.  Your solution seems cool, but\nat the same time, I don't wanna give away any thieves :)\n\nWilbie\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: wilbie\nSubj: thief guild disguise\nCc: blade\nDate: Dec 15\n\nI fixed a bug in the thiefs, What oyu want to do is a plain\nole query_level() which you will return the disguised as guild\nif the thief is disguised, To ensure it IS a thief, you would\nhave to query_real_guild()  So you are on the right track.\n\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nfritz\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: circe\nDate: Dec 18\n\nhiya!\nBlade, Circe told me that my mail necesarry to unbanish her,\nso i think she should be unbanished, i guess she will remember this\nlong enough. (hehe she promised me EVERYTHING what can promised..)\n\nFritz!\n\n**\ncirce\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: me\nDate: Dec 18\n\nOk fritz gave the ok hopefully he has written to you, please\nput me back in the hideout, i will behave, I didnt do anything last time...\nI just wanna level Circe and have a good time, besides i wont be on for 5 weeks\nX mas break so can you please ask Fritz, to put me back in**\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: backstab\nCc: sauron\nDate: Dec 21\n\nI have changed it, and it should be ok now. A level 20 thief\nwith 20 Dex can kill a level 20 monster in one hit. I also\ncommented at the start. ;)\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: blackthorn roots\nDate: Jan  7\n\nI added a blackthorn root bush to my area.\nit is in /players/brainsprain/bis/rooms/f-1.c\n\nin case you keep a log of where they are.  I think the thieves need more\nof them.  \n\nTalk to you later man.\n\nBrainsprain\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: Paranoi/Mort\nDate: Jan 10\n\nAmusing thing to tell ya.\n\nI noticed that your bitcher about skills not\nworking on other guilds is the same\nguy in my guild bitching of the same thing.\n\nParanoi's alter-ego keeps bitching that the Monks are too powerful\nto me as well.\n\nFound it amusing that he uses the same words to you.\n\n:)\nSAff\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: hide command\nDate: Jan 13\n\nPeople are hiding items in the hideout out.\nI yelled at fritz for this, saying that he shouldnt hide stuff from other\nthieves.  Just letting you know. Don't even really care =-)\n\nBrainsprain\n\n**\nfritz\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: circe\nDate: Jan 19\n\nHiya Blade!\n\nI see that circe is here again and she has learned her lesson.\nI think that she should be allowed back into hideout(she was banned over\na month).\n\nFritz\n\n**\nwarlord\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: Report log\nCc: mangla sauron warlord\nDate: Jan 28\n\nYou have 4 entries in your .rep that are really your discretion\non how to fix, if needed, please attend to those ASAP\nThanks.\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: blade\nSubj: figured it out\nDate: Jan 29\n\ni was randomly looking through the poison code today and i am about 90\npercent certain i know how to fix the problem with it not hurting people\nwhen they drink it.  The problem is /obj/soft_drink has a build in \ndrink function that over rides your drink function.  In order to fix\nthis you should put in an a void init with an add_action for drink\nthis should fix it\n\n\n**\natsui\n**\nTo: brainsprain\nSubj: that fat bitch debbie\nCc: finger, blade\nDate: Feb 23\n\ndude-\nshe told me that the monk guild is 'protected' from thieves.... what the fuck\ndoes this mean?? all i know is that i backstabbed a level 18 monk and she \ndidn't die.... that is definitely a problem.\n\nplease get back to me on this. i'd mail blade but i think he's dead.\n  atsui\n\n**\nquilt\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: thieves\nCc: blade, brainsprain, septian\nDate: Jul 30\n\nok i basically am gonna compare thieves and monks (cos you guys already wiped out the other guilds)\nmonks can hide in dark - why?\nmonks have death blows..fine..they can use them as many times as they want..thieves only get one backstab\ndeath blow does 2/3 damage of backstab i suppose\nmonks have HEAPS of other combat abilities\nadmittedly..some of those abilities are shit..but when you consider that we only have one\ndoesn't seem to make sense\n\nnow i'm not trying to take down monks...(although they are overpowered) but thieves are now too underpowered without ambush or throw..\nnow they were buggy (or so blade told me)..fair enough..but surely we can get something to complement backstab\n\nand i think also that most of the thief abilities are pk orientated..because to put it simply they are relevant to most npcs who a)have more hp and b)are not effected by mudballs and stuff\n\nanyway..i had a few suggestions in the past..i'll mail them to you if you like..\n\nP.S. we don't want to powerup backstab..just want some combat options\n\n**\n"
