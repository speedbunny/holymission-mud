Just when i was unsure\nwhether i should log in or not :(\n\nAnyway .... did I tell you that I plan even more sriously to visit Holland ?\nIf I 'survive' Siberia and have the money I really want to go there this \nsummer or autumn at the latest.\n\nBtw. do you know any good place where a student could sleep for a couple of \nnigths ? That's one thing hard to get info about from here.\n\nAh ... I almost forgot : Happy New Year !!! *grin*\n\nDo you plan to make some similar visit in the near future ?\n\nBye\nBgs\n\n**\nbgs\n**\nTo: ausus\nRe:   Hi!\nDate: Jan 15\n\n\n\n  Hi !\n\n Wow ! That would be a _great_ help !!! Ireally want to even if I have to \nhitchhike all the way :)\nAnd it will be a big change after the one month I'm going to spend in Siberia\nwith probably temperatures dropping below -50 ...\nI think some of my friends will be able to help with dutch. I understand\nsome of it from english anyway. One of my plans is to around on bike. The \ndistances will also allow me to reach anywhere in one day. I'm almost sure\nI'll find some good place to hire a bike. :)\n\nI hope your exams went well. I used to teach chemistry :) You'll get over it\njust liek anything else.\n\nWhat is life ?! Well that's a REALLY intresting subject :)\n\nMy address :\n\n                    Zoltan Posfai       <- this happens to be my name\n                  H-1025 Budapest\n                   Zoldlomb u. 40/c\n                      HUNGARY\n\nI don't know if I ever mentioned it before but if you get itchy feet and come\nto hungary i'd be glad to help you. You'd definitely need help with hungarian\n...\n\nCU soon\n\nBye\nBgs\n\n**\nbgs\n**\nTo: ausus\nSubj: Chemistry\nDate: Jan 17\n\n\n\n Hi !\n\nAs a matter of fact I do like every natural science. In high school I had the\nluck to have the best teacher in hungary. (He is the one who prepared the\nOlympic group in chemistry and won a bunch of gold medals with them).\nI earn some of my money by teaching. And i teach what there is need for.\nThose who were average in high school prepared for university exams from their\nhighschool papers. I was the best in the class so I have plenty of resources\nleft even if I forgot a lot.\nIf you need help I'd be glad to help you. (I know it's not easy on the Net \nbut I'm serious).\n\nI can asure you that my current studies and work have nothing to do with\nchemistry :)\nAnd I prefer teaching maths, physics and this sort of stuff. (Or just \norganize a nice surviving contest for those with overflowing energy :)\n\nThis year we are going to organize 6 of them. They are very popular and we\nhave participant from the whole country (some of other countries too !)\n\nImagine, we have been living a couple of hundrets of meters from a cave for\n12 years and I only got to descend into it now :)\nHave you got any caves in the deeper part of your country ?\n\nI gotta go now ...\n\nCU\nBgs\n\n**\nbgs\n**\nTo: ausus\nRe:   Hi\nDate: Jan 19\n\n\n\n Hi !\n\nOK I learnt geography as well :) And I know why Netherland is called as it is.\nThat's why I said 'deeper' in the country. Who knows ? You don't need huge\ncliff to have caves ... Did you know that the lowest icecave in the world is in hungary. It's about 200 meters above see level ...\n\nHow went your exam ? I'm anxious to know :)\n\nKeep up the good work.\n\nBye\nBgs\n\n**\nbgs\n**\nTo: ausus\nSubj: hp\nDate: Jan 28\n\n\n\n  Hi !\n\nTanx for the URL. I akready got a lot of info from it. They didn't answer to all of my questions \nbut i'm sure with time i'll manage everything. (For example i dunno whether it is possible to hire\nbikes suitable for longer distances like 200km. I'd like to go around the country and i'd need  to\nmake these  distances.)\nBtw: I forgot the name of the town you live in *blush*. Could you tell me ?\n\nCU\nBgs\n\n**\n"
