Kevin is actually in the process of moving out...can\nyou believe it!  But its a very slow process....I don't mind though since we'll soon have the\nplace to ourselves.  The first time ever!  I can't wait!  We're going to have to buy some furniture,\nlike a coffee table, bookcases and I would like a unit for my ornaments and stuff.  We need a video though\nwhich will take a big chunk, so we're just taking things bit by bit.\nwhich will take a big chunk, so we're just taking things bit by bit.\nWork is pretty good right now, although there's a streak of bad luck going about in our store\nour pricing\ncoordinator suddenly died recently of a heart attack, our supervisor has been hit with a mysterious kidney/\nback complaint, and our manager has just been admitted for open heart surgery, major bypasses.\nWe just hope that's all our bad luck!\nBill and I have started running again, just a mile a day, I hate it, but it should do me some good.  I have\nto get my bp down in time for my examination this month, if it's too high she'll take me off the pill.  And \nI'm not ready for that yet!\nAnyway, Bill's munching away on dinner so mine must be getting cold in the kitchen, so I'll write more\nlater and hope you're doing great!  Lucky sods, getting really hot weather, we've had pretty much non-\nstop rain for the last 2 weeks!\n*wave*\nlove Sharon\n\n**\nbuggerlugs\n**\nTo: trillien\nSubj: To the housewife!\n\nDate: Jun  8\n\nGlad you're gonna start swimming, I love the water.  Well, when it's not pouring out of the sky and is\nnot preventing me from swimming in the first place!  Mostly the only pools they have over here are\nopen air ones and they're really small, I'd give anything for an indoor one like the Commonwealth right\nnow, I can't stand having to wait til the water is warm enough or the weather is warm.  All this rain is\nbeginning to remind me of home, the folks at work are frozen stiff, they can't stand these low temperatures\nwhich are not really low, just the air conditioning is on right now.  I took a few words like glaikit,\ndrookit and scunnered to work yesterday and confused all incredibly.  I love doing stuff like that.  I just \nhave to come up with some more.  You think the americans you have are frustrating, just think about what I\nhave to deal with!  HUNGRY americans with food stamps and attitudes!  Drives me nuts!  Matt has this saying\n\"Must go shopping....have no life\" which is quite apt.  \n\"Must go shopping....have no life\" which is quite apt.  \nAnyway, I'm not dressed yet, I have the late shift, 3:30 til midnight, and its still raining, I hope it stops\nor I'll have to wake Bill and get him to take me..which I don't like doing too much.\nor I'll have to wake Bill and get him to take me..which I don't like doing too much.\nI hate this stupid return button which repeats all I say!!!!!\nTalk to you soon\nLove Sharon\n\n**\nbuggerlugs\n**\nTo: trillien\nSubj: x\n\nCc: **\nDate: Jun  8\n\nq\nq\nq\nSorry, couldn't get out of this one.....*blush*\nqq\nq\n\n**\nbuggerlugs\n**\nTo: trillien\nSubj: Hope you had a happy holiday!\n\nDate: Jun 24\n\nHi Diane, how was your holiday?  I'm dying for mine, I just have to figure out \nwhen I want it, and I'm not sure when that should be.  A whole week without \nworking and still getting paid!  \nworking and still getting paid!  \nLife here is ok, it's scorching hot right now, so I'm getting some sun, Bill's working today\nwhich is a bit of bad luck since I don't get another day off til Saturday and Bill will\nprobably be working then too.  If the pool wasn't so crowded we'd be in the pool, but there's\ntoo many kids about, too noisy.  I just set a blanket down on the grass outside and read.\nBill's having some political trouble in Wonderland, the wizzes are all starting to fight,\nand Bill is getting into it too.  I'm enjoying reading everyone attacking each other in such\na petty  way over petty things...isn't that terrible!!!  I need more excitement! \nI love having an empty apartment!  It stays so clean and tidy when there's just me and Bill.  Except for\nthe bedroom, where Bill deposits all his clothes and stuff without care!  I won $100 on the lottery\na couple of weeks ago, so I bought a clock and a big picture frame and we went to dinner too, it was\ngood fun!  We're going to have to buy a video, we may go tonight when he gets home, the NBA drafts\nare on tomorrow and he wants to see them.\nWell, I'll probably send more mail later on, I better get some more stuff done.\nTake care!\nLove Sharon\n\n**\nbuggerlugs\n**\nTo: trillien\nSubj: Clean Clean Clean!!!\n\nDate: Jul 10\n\nHi hon, well, it's 5pm on the last day off I have for a few hectic days...  Bill's at work\nand I've spent most of the day cleaning...and it's done!  I can honestly say there's not\na whole lot more I could do...Bill has the floors to wash but that's it.. (that's his only\nhousekeeping job).  I tackled the bedroom...the rest was pretty clean anyway, I did it a few\ndays ago.  But the bedroom...I can't remember when it was last done..Bill's ALWAYS in here since\nit's where the computer is.  Now the floor is clear, the surfaces are clean, it's tidy and neat..\nI'm really proud of it.  \nI've had a couple of days off, Michael came across for a few days, he's working for a pretty good\ncompany now, but has been laid off for 3 weeks, he was asking about you.  We went out for dinner the\nother night, the first time Bill suggested it without it being fast food, and without it being\nsuggested to him.  We're in the middle of waiting for out VCR, and Bill's just bought the computer\ngame Twinsen's Odyssey, it's seemingly the newest thing out...it's quite impressive.  I got Baldies, a\nstrategy game which is incredible amounts of fun!  The number of computer game boxes building up is\nquite bad considering, but Bill is enjoying having the money to buy them.  I'm enjoying not having to\ncount how much I can spend on anything.  I've been spending a lot of time in the local Hallmark shop,\nand Bill hasn't complained once, only to tell me he's not following me in there!\nI'm ready for a change in workplace...our favourite bookstore is hiring...so I'm thinking about it.\nWell, my chicken is marinating in honey-mustard barbeque sauce, but I've still to figure out what's \ngoing with it, it's amazing I'm cooking, it's just for myself, Bill won't be back til late tonight,\nI never cook for myself...can't be bothered. But tonight I'm going for the works!\nWell, I'll write again soon, give my love to all!\nLove and hugs\nSharon\n\n**\nbuggerlugs\n**\nTo: trillien\nSubj: hfjsdafh\n\nDate: Jul 16\n\nRight now it's midnight, and I'm just about to go to bed after a grueling week of work...so I'll\nsend you all the stuff you need tomorrow when my brain is less cloudy....man what a time we've had at \nwork, shortstaffed and cash short....stressful!\nSee ya soon!\nSharon\n\n**\nbuggerlugs\n**\nTo: trillien\nSubj: hello der!\n\nDate: Jul 16\n\nHey, how's it going?  Great to hear from you.  I've been very stressed recently so it's nice to get mail!\n6am and 12am.  Well, one of them (Bert) got married on Sunday, and 4 of the office went up to New York for\nhis wedding...leaving 5 of us to cover 3 and a half days work, hectic work considering it was a weekend.\nWell, only one of us knows how to open the day, and only one other knows how to close.  So Philip had to open\nevery day, and he had to come back Saturday night to close the week too.  We were very short on cashiers too\nwhich meant it was really busy...and in the end, our cash was short.  It still is.  Which is very stressful.\nThey all came back yesterday, and Jackie, the customer service manager surprised me by not being upset at being short\nso that was good.  But I got yelled at by some ignorant customer who's Western Union money transfer took too \nlong cos of a slow connection.  I broke down!  Can you believe it! Me? Normally I would've taken it all\nin my stride and been mean back...but i just burst into tears...stupid cow I am.  So Julie, one of the other girls\nstarted laying into this woman verbally.  It was good to see.  Anyway, today is my day off and I'm not going to\ndo a bloody thing.  I intend to rest up completely...Bill's working...and although I'll probably handwash\na few things and tidy some, I'm going to be lazy, I'm totally worn out.\nThat's most of the reason I'm looking for a new job.  The stress of cash coming up short.  I know that I'm doing\neverything right, I'm counting things 3 or four times to make sure...but that doesn't mean everyone else thinks\nthe same.  I was the last one to enter the office, so naturally I'll be the first one out..and I don't want\nthat to hurt my reference or anything..even though I've done nothing wrong.  And I\"m looking for a full time \nposirion with benefits, right now we have no medical insurance which is scary.  And I'd like to get out of\nthe grocery business....it's too scary!  I'd rather one department.  I'm not unhappy...just ready for a change.\nUp until last week, I've been completely satisfied with everything...I'm just restless now.\nApart from work...Bill picked up our VCR yesterday, so that's really good.  Now I can spend all my time\nwatching bad movies! *laugh*\nShaun's party...well I called at the start of it...wrong time totally, noone wanted to speak to me, everything\nwas too hectic...in hindsight I shouldn't have called at all.   But I'm ok about it.\nIt's in the 90's now....toooooo hot!  I still walk to work in my shorts...which has a good effect on my tan.\nAnd since all the makeup I would wear would slide off my face in the heat...I'm going au naturelle....kind of \nscary huh!  \nNow....my email....lets see if I remember correctly...\nwwelch@uky.campus.mci.net\nand Rufus' is.....\nand Rufus' is.....\nRGHKendall@aol.com\nthat one's easy.\nI've been feeling kind of dizzy recently at times, I'm putting it down to the heat...and tiredness.  Hopefully\nI'll be restored to my natural vigour over the next few days!  We're hoping to take a week off work and go up\nto his grandmother's estate up in New York next month, if I can get the time off.\nWell, before this mail becomes longer than time...I'll write again soon, and take care!  And tell David to\nkeep up on those baby mags...get him used to it so he won't faint in the delivery room! *grin*\nLove to everyone and happy knicker hunting!\nSharon\n\n**\nbuggerlugs\n**\nTo: trillien\nSubj: oops\n\nDate: Jul 16\n\nI think some of the mail got messed up .  At the start I was talking about how there's 10 of us in the office\nat work, to cover 6am til 12am.\n\n**\nstanley\n**\nTo: trillien\nSubj: It's cold here\nDate: Oct 16\n\nDropped in to say hi to you! I'm not on HM nearly as\nmuch as I used to be (you may have noticed) because I \nam spending so much time on Wonderland. I got an area\nand a quest in, and am recoding fighters, and gee, \nI guess Im doing a lot there. I am back in school trying\nto become an engineer, which means I am no longer living\nin Lexington with my brother Silk and his SILLY wife\nSharon...as a matter fo fact, I'm 4 hours drive away now.\nI see that you logged on 4 days ago, so there is\nstill some hope that you will read this in the sometime\nnear future. It's time for bed now...goodnight!\n\nStanley (Michael)\n\n**\nstanley\n**\nTo: trillien\nSubj: Ask and thou shalt receive\nDate: Oct 19\n\nI agree it's not the same at all. I log on from time to\ntime to see if anyone I know from the \"old days\" is \non, and maybe sit around and pine for the glory days.\nAnyway, if you ever have the mind, and I am online,\nI will usually be found at 194.19.24.20 3287. Not a lot\nof people usually on, but it's better then here, imho.\n\nStanley\n\n**\n"
