I have not set them up as\nninja weapons yet (have not included the file) but you are welcome to them.\nThey are the following:\n\nButterfly knife (like a tanto)\nFan (small iron fan, popular with Japanese warriors)\nHarpoon (same as a yari)\nHooksword (sword with hook at end - good for disarming)\nSpear (may just replace with \"yari\")\nTonfa (wooden PR-24)\n\nAlso, the village is (according to legend) the birthplace of White Crane\nChuan-Fa, which is the largest influence on Okinawan Karate.  So if you \nneed a place for ninja to learn karate...\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: warlord\nRe:   Hmm\nDate: Jul 24\n\nSorry man, couldn't connect to my ISP.\n\nW.\n\n**\nthumper\n**\nTo: warlord\nSubj: new wiz status\nDate: Aug  8\n\nHello,\n      Sorry for running out but paris (mike) oh well.

Mangla stepped in the way.  He told me he\nwas going to tell you, I thought he had.\n\nHis claim is that you're not around enough.  \n\nI am fighting it, but this mud is dead, so its difficult starting crap\nwith Mangla...\n\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: warlord\nSubj: Mangla's post on Arch board...\nDate: Aug  8\n\n[mangla         ] [Jul 29] [Re: Retirement                               ]\n\nI would like to see an active wiz in there. I know he logs in, but\nhe has not been active in fixing and changing things. I als\nknow that recently I have been a little lax, but I am working on\nrepairing that problem right now. As for Warlord, we have asked hime\nto show is activity several times by his own sayings, but he has\nnot done it. Was simple task in theory, rework his own quest.\nIf he was willing to do this then all consideration would be given to\na promotion. Right now thought I do not think we are gonna be\nlacking in arches. With current player load, 2-3 arches is 'in theory' more\nthan enough.\n\n\n\n**\namethyst\n**\nTo: warlord\nSubj: well...\nDate: Aug 16\n\nI thought you were online\nI guess I miss you so much that i was seeing your name\nI don't go to Wow anymore.. but i have been going to dune\nmore .. my alias's are Gwyneth and Hera\numm.. email me .. but ya never will.. but anyhows\nit is LadyNemmy@aol.com\nicq 5215037\nokay? love ya muches.\nGeorg-Anne\n\n**\nnobunaga\n**\nTo: warlord\nSubj: hello\nDate: Oct 11\n\nHi Warlord or Kevin right??\n\n\tI am trying to start a mud (nightmare).
