I'm fine, just very busy in this weeks. I have to take part\non a conference on the University on 8th of nov., and I prepare now\nthe subject of my speach. I have to present my work on Wednesday, next\nweek, and in these weeks I made some reactions to complete it, and wrote the\nesence of my work (that's what I have to present on Wednesday on paper), and \non 8th of nov. I have 15 mins to present it in face of a commite (my God).\nHope you understand what I want to say...\nHow are you? How's the work in the theatre? What important things is\nhappening with you?\nPlease write me here or/and in e-mail.\nHugs, Janos\n\n**\nsilas\n**\nTo: schpankay\nSubj: Interview\n\nDate: Oct  4\n\nYesterday I had a phone interview with the recruiter and it went very\nwell, but I didn't pass the aptitude test today (got 81, needed 86). The\nrecruiter said she'd see if she could get me a second chance with \nmanagement though by letting me take the COBOL test which is required of \nall applicants; the catch is that I'd have to score 14/24 instead of\n12/24 like the others in order to make up for my blunder today. Sounds\nlike a deal to me so I'll be buying that COBOL book in any event. Even\nif I'm not able to take that test I'll still have a basic knowledge of it.\nIn a way it's good that I didn't pass today 'cos what if I would have\ngiven my two week notice and then failed the COBOL test? \nIn any case..oh, you just logged in. mailing this right now. :)\n\nLoving spanks,\n-Tom\n\n**\nsilas\n**\nTo: schpankay\nSubj: Futureworld\n\nDate: Oct  5\n\nI rented it last night and almost fainted as I watched the dream sequence\nwith Yul.

The recruiter insisted that it was\na great score for someone who had no programming background\nand said that I could take it over Thursday. She'll also be calling\nthe local branch office so I can use some of their computer training\nprograms tomorrow and Wednesday. So things are back to the usual with\nme still hanging in limbo.\nHope things are less hectic with you! ;)\nLoving spanks,\n-Tom\n\n**\njimpa\n**\nTo: schpankay\n Re:   jew!\\\nDate: Oct 17\n\n\n\ni consulted my calender \nyoyo momma\nand i had taken the weekend of the 15-17 off to come down to bloomington anyway\nsooooooooooooo what time is the concert cause i have to\ndrive back later at night ..

The\nrecruiter wants to give me a rare third chance next month though because\nshe felt that I was unfairly rushed into everything. Sounds good to me!\nThat way I'll be able to give a decent notice, move to wherever I have to\nand study for the class which would begin in January. I'd definitely\nlike to come down to Bloomington in two weeks and visit. Sound like a\ngood idea to you? *grin*\nOn a final note..\n\nA Jew books a flight from Jordan to NYC. Unfortunately the only seat\nremaining is between two huge Arabs, but the Jew has no choice. About \nan hour into the flight the Arab next to the window growls 'Hey, Jewboy,\ngo get me a Pepsi!' and the Jew obliges. While he's gone the Arab spits\na huge glob into one of the Jew's shoes (which he removed earlier).\nAs the Jew comes back the other Arab blurts 'Jewboy, I want a Pepsi too!'\nSo the Jew leaves and the Arab spits into his other shoe. As the flight\nlands and the Jew puts his shoes back on he moans and cries 'Spit in the\nshoes, piss in the Pepsi...will it ever end?!'\n\nHehe!\n-Tom\n\n**\ndaniella\n**\nTo: schpankay\n Re:   jew!\nDate: Oct 29\n\nheya\ni have a shitload of stuff to do, and i just cant get myself moving to\ndo it.  my group thing is due tomorrow and ive only done a little bit\nof work on it. *sigh*  then i have a midterm due wednesday that i\nhavent started yet, and a paper due in 2 weeks over like 5 books i\nhavent read.  *cry*\ni register on wednesday.  i havent picked out yet what i wanna take.\nhow was the weekend at home?  i bought some caramel apples.  *cackle*\nand we carved pumpkins.  hehehehee\noh well, i better go now...\nlove\ndani\n\n**\ndaniella\n**\nTo: schpankay\nSubj: tom\n\nDate: Oct 29\n\nbe strong!  dont give in!  well, give in, but not all the way!\nhehehehehehe\nmake him make a decision, so youre not just his sex toy\n*grin*\nmail us what you said to griffon and what she tried to say back\nhehehehehehehehe\nshes an ass and i hate her and her fucking brother\nargh\ni gotta go meet someone for this group thing...\nthen i have a 2 hr class i didnt read for\n*sigh*  im so fucking behind, i might as well give up now...\nlove\ndani\n\n**\nsilas\n**\nTo: schpankay\nSubj: Requests?\n\nDate: Oct 30\n\nI was wondering if you'd like me to bring anything special down over\nthe weekend...anything I have access to that is.

worked.\ni am too scared to apply at that lumber yard, although all of those\nflannel-clad men were making me weak-kneed and panting.  i wanted to just pick\none of them and take him home and put him to work satisfying me.  hehehehehe\nand all the shiny pick-up trucks...*sigh*\ni hope mark knows that if he brings that woman with him he wont see robyn.\nit doesnt even have to do with whatever

It's a \nlittle rambling from a hack but I hope that will not ruin your enjoyment\n\nShe Walks in Beauty\n\nShe walks in beauty\nSable tresses cascading her back\nSparkling eyes and an undying smile\nHer face's only clothing\nThese things don not neauty make\n\nDaily meetings lessen her effect not\nHearts skip when she is sights\nNearly die of happiness with a glance\nEmbraces from this love, ecstasy\nThese are effects not the cause\n\nHer lips glisten in any light\nFrom them magnificent phrases flow\nEnlighted words spring from her\nAided by a source hidden from sight\nEnchanted the ears of the listener\n\nHer body full and sensuous\nAdorned with once normal garments\nMade divine by her touch\nFlesh peaks out teasingly brilliant\nThis the covering, ont the essence\n\nDreams of Her cannot be baneful\nPerfection unattainable on earth\nHalf remembered in waking hours\nParadise achieved in a day\nHer impact remembered for ages\n\nThe body which pales Mona Lisa\nThe mind which stuns Don Giovani\nThis combination sheer perfection\nHas captured my heart simply because\nShe walks in beauty.\n\nHave fun eh?\n\n**\nbobo\n**\nTo: schpankay\nSubj: phone #\nDate: Mar  6\n\n907 474 6666 extension 3138\n\nsee ya later\n\n**\nbobo\n**\nTo: schpankay\nSubj: Letter\nDate: Apr  3\n\nWell since i didn't hear anything about the tape that i sent you i can only\nassume one of two things.  1. you didn't like it and are sparing my feelings\n(if so thanks) 2. you just wanted to write me back and tell me all of these \nthings that inspired you not only from the tape but also from the letter\nthough I don't remember exactly what i wrote(ok so i wuoldn't know the diff\nif you teld me that I praised buddha and gave you my soul at the same time--\nthough that would be kind of an interesting thing to do).  Or i just thought\nof a new one, you just didn't think it nessecary to write/ mud mail or anything\nelse.  Either way I hope that you are having as grand a time as you can \npossibly expect in Merrillville and that everything else is going well.

That's not too much fun but as \nlong as yoy had fun i guess it's all worth it.  What it really sounds like is \nthat you had almost as much fun there as I did.  Hmm I guess that's just another\nthing that we have in common.  What is that, the third or fourth thing?  What\nyou said about being born there I can relate to but in the long rung I don't \nthat it would have been all that great because even though I could do all of \nthose things that you can do in NY(which is just about everything) but then \nagain i just don't think that i'd be the same person.  Wait a minute, maybe that's good, hmm...So are you\ngoing to let me borrow that jacket or are you going to hoard it?\n\nWe'll see ya later\n\nKeith\n\n**\ndaniella\n**\nTo: schpankay\nSubj: pissed\nDate: Apr  9\n\nim so pissed off, i havent gotten a check from that asshole for the last 2\nweeks yet, and daycare is due today, and i cant pay it.  then he doesnt reply\nto the mail i sent him, when i specifically asked him to, instead of\ntalking about it on the phone.  so bloody typical\nrobyn didnt want to see the easter bunny after we got to the mall all dressed \nup and everything.  oh well, thats ok\nill call you later\n*scream*\nim not answering the phone tonight\ndanielle\n\n**\ndaniella\n**\nTo: schpankay\nSubj: doody, part II\nDate: Apr 18\n\nhello\nmore doody\nbritish people are sickos\nmarks parents are horrible people, i hope england sinks into the ocean\n\nmy dad is coming tomorrow, and i am not going to kill myself cleaning\nmy house is already clean, but it doesnt gleam in the sunlight, and \nsparkle when the light hits it, the way his does.  of course, mine also\ndoesnt look like the page out of a home decorating magazine.  ;p\nsilence of the lambs is on\ni can smell your cone\ni ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti\ni am going to spend my night in a tequila-induced hze.  :)  wish\nyou were here\nlove\ndani\n\n**\ndaniella\n**\nTo: schpankay\nSubj: *wetting her pants*\nDate: Apr 18\n\nindiana jones and the last crusade is on\ni am wetting my pants\nsean connery and harrison ford together is more than i can take!\nif jean reno was in it, id actually have a heart attack  *CACKLE*\nalready insane\ndani\n\n**\nsytar\n**\nTo: schpankay\nSubj: mail\nDate: Aug 14\n\nHI!\nI wrote you an e-mail, please read it, and respond.\nI'm waiting your mail.\nTo hear about you :-)\n*many hugs*\nJanos\n\n**\nsytar\n**\nTo: schpankay\nSubj: e-mail\nDate: Aug 17\n\nHI!\nI'll wait for your mail.
