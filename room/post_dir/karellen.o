You wouldn't believe how complex life can\nget when you least expect... then again, maybe you WOULD believe :)\nI haven't been ignoring you or anything. I just haven't been able to \nfind the time or anything. Plus these days I never know if I'm going to \nget a reply to any e-mail that I send. I've sent mails to people too and\nthey just haven't bothered mailing. They've had time but just couldn't \ngive a shit.\nAlso, I don't come here very often. I spend most of my time on talkers.\nYou can catch me on the following talkers:\nOz: extro.ucc.usyd.edu.au 4000\nWay Out West: talker.com 2574\nloadsa luv,\nPete.\n\n**\nperaphon\n**\nTo: karellen\nRe:   me\nDate: Dec  2\n\nhey hon\nhoww's it going?
