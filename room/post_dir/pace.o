messages "saffrin\n**\nTo: pace\nSubj: What spell were you trying to practice?\n\nDate: Dec 24\n\nPlease let me know what spell, you see the arches have taken upon \nthemselves to remove spells or edit my files without mailing me or\nletting me know about it.  Spells like teleport and meteor swarm and\nlegend mage things like the wish scrolls were all removed\nduring the last year.  Teleport was removed in early Nov. 1995 3 days before\nI wizzed.  Until the new spells are done, the arches seem to remove what they\nwant when they want.  It is what the GM's have had to put up with in the last\nyear of problems and political bulls***.  \n\nSorry\nSaffrin\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: pace\nSubj: thanks\n\nDate: Dec 25\n\nWill look thanks,\n\nmerry xmas\nSaff\n\n**\n"
