messages "sauron\n**\nTo: gwynn\nSubj: xp\n\nDate: Oct  2\n\n]From looking at the code for all living objects, it appears that the amount\nof xp you get when you kill either a monster or a player is dependent on\nnot only your level but your quest points as well... The higher your level,\nand the more quests you have solved, the more xp you will get.\n\nHope that helps\nSauron\n\n**\nanastasia\n**\nTo: gwynn\nSubj: Hi!\n\nCc: .\nDate: Mar  6\n\nI'm sorry..here's the mail, I've been  really busy around here..\nvery easy to forget things. :(\nwrite back, ok?\nAnastasia\n\n**\ndaniella\n**\nTo: gwynn\n Re:   hi :)\nDate: May 21\n\nhappy belated birthday!!!!\ni didnt get this mail til today since hm has been down for so long\n*kiss*\ndani\n\n**\ndaniella\n**\nTo: gwynn\n Re:   thanx \nDate: May 22\n\n17th birthday???  heh, ill be 23 on august 23rd\nlove\ndani\n\n**\ndaniella\n**\nTo: gwynn\n Re:   bd\nDate: May 23\n\n*grin*  i dont mind if people think im younger than i am, cause then\nwhen im older maybe ill look younger and no one will know how old i really am\ndid that make any sense?  anyway, you know how after about age 39 women dont \nlike to tell their age.  it seems silly to me.  \ni am off to the library to get some more books.  i have very little to do\nall day so i get a load of mystery books and scare myself when i read them\n\nlove\ndani\n\n**\nkryll\n**\nTo: gwynn\nSubj: big wolf\n\nDate: Jun 24\n\nok, scroll is back in, in a new location but still along\nthe same lines of the letter and location of the quest...\n\nhope that helps you\n\nkryll\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: gwynn\nRe:   ideas\nDate: Nov  7\n\n(1) taken care of (see adv guild board)\n(2) true...
