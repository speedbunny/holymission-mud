I am not sure what you are asking.\n\nIf you have an area you need approved. First ask your mentor to\ngo through it. If that does not work, then ask Sauron and/or myself\nand we will get to it asap.\n\nIf you are loking for area ideas, let sauron and I know! :)\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: michi\nRe:   mentor\nCc: sauron\nDate: Jul  2\n\nGive me an idea of the type of area you want to make and I will\ntry and find you a mentor.
