Basically all you need to do is\nreplace all your checks to the player's legend_level with checks to their\nnormal level... You can decide yourself at what point you think your guild\nmembers are worthy to receive whatever extra features legends currently\nget.\n\nAs for the quest requirements, I would just overwrite the do_advance() fun\nin your guild room (making sure you call ::do_advance() in that) and have a\ncheck to see if the player's quest point total is above a certain level...\nor something like that.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. :)\n\nSauron\n\n**\ntrout\n**\nTo: gareth\nSubj: impale\n\nDate: Sep 25\n\n\tIt's ready. Two files needed. ..trout/fighter/obj/pike.c and\n\t...trout/fighter/skills/impale.c\n\tI think I've worked out all kinks. Didn't have exorbant amount of\n\ttime to test it.

As it was, until they failed to parry a hit, they didn't fight\nback because the attacker is set by hit_player() in living.c and you weren't\ncalling that. Hence I changed it from\n\nreturn 0;\n\nto\n\nreturn me->hit_player(0, kind, elem);\n\nso that the required functionality was calling in living.c and there is still\nno damage.\n\nJust letting you know.\n\nSauron\n\n**\ngareth\n**\nTo: emerald\nSubj: help with guild\nCc: gareth\nDate: Feb 16\n\n\nHeya Alison how are ya doin' ?\nI'm okie. just looking for a job and chilling out for\na bit going for interviews.\nI was wondering if you could do me a favor? could you possibly code a few things for my guild till i get settled down?\nit woiould only be for about 1 month or so.\nthanks\nCarlos\n\n\n**\nbalan\n**\nTo: gareth\nSubj: guild powers\nDate: Feb 24\n\ndeath blow - kills things  automatically when thjy have are barely alive\nweapon smash - as the name implies\n\nknockout/stun - which will deprive anenemy of an attack\n                for a short period of time\n\nthese are some of the new skills i want to put in\n\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: gareth\nSubj: berzerk\nDate: Mar  5\n\nI've done some work on the soul and have moved berzerk/calm out to separate\nfiles. Everything is in /p/g/guild/sauron/ - they all load, but I haven't\ntested them any further. I also moved the fighter chat line to a separate\nfile.\n\nLet me know what you think.\nSauron\n\n**\nexos\n**\nTo: gareth\nSubj: fighter guild\nDate: Mar 20\n\nHey man.\n\nJust wanted to offer my help if you need some help with fighter guild.\nJust ask anything you might need.\n\nLater\n\n**\nexos\n**\nTo: gareth\nSubj: berzerk_shad\nDate: Mar 30\n\nOk a few points....\n\n\nFirst off....if you call hit_player, then everytime damage is dealt to fighter.\nthey will strike out 1-3 times at that target.\n\nNot too bad, but I have monsters that hit everytime a player hits....so we have an\ninfinite loop here.\n\nProbably need to base it on attack().\nSo iffighter attacks once, he will tack on 1-3 more attacks.\nI'll approach from this angle.\n\nOne thing....if a fighter is berzerk using your current shadow, they NEVER take damage.\nbecause they never receive hit_player damage!\n\nMore on this later.\n\n**\nakira\n**\nTo: gareth\nSubj: hi\nDate: Mar 30\n\nI was reading your fighters board the other day and I saw that giants\ncan not bash. Well the way I look at it (keep in mind I am a barbarian)\nis why hide behind a shield when you hit someone? Do it the barbarian\nway just body block the punk and knock them on there ass! You would\nhave to be very strong to do this but giants are and it is a real no\nbrainer. It takes no skill to run at someone and hit them with your\nbody. Give it some thought.\n\t\t\t\t\tAkira/Khan\np.s. make it so barbarians can wield frostbite sword william has :)\n\n**\nakira\n**\nTo: gareth\nSubj: idea\nDate: Apr  3\n\nWell you could at least mail me back and tell me what you thought\nof my idea. And then make it so barbarians can use the frostbite\nsword. We need all the help we can get. And while your at it if\nyou could find us a new GM that would be nice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAkira/Khan\n\n\n**\ntexas\n**\nTo: gareth\nSubj: emails addresses\nDate: Apr 23\n\n\nok these are my email addresses in order of prefernece :\n\njohn@greebo.snarc.com\n\ndarke@mailexcite.com\n\nTexas@lineone.net\n\nTex\n\n\n**\nsalesman\n**\nTo: gareth\nSubj: Wizzing\nDate: May 16\n\nDear Sensei,\nIt will take a li'l more time to start exam...
