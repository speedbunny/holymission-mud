(But we are sick and tired of working with idiots, so\n   don't be that guy!)\n\t\t\t\t\t-Trout & Akira\n\n**\nkurt\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: MUD politics\n\nDate: Dec 16\n\n\tI have read your message in the Adv. guild about the state of this MUD. I have to say that I really agree with a lot of the things you said. Not that I was ever in a position to wield a lot of power around here, but I have been around long enough to see how things work. Mangla IS destroying this place. He doesn't want people, he wants power. We need a serious revamping of the Arch situation. \n\tI have, on many occasions seen wizzes ignore people yelling about bugs, while they sit in the church and talk about what they're doing that weekend or other such things. That, I think, is why this MUD is how it is. Not because of outright hostility (for the most part), but because of indifference. Not caring about fellow players. \n\tWhen I started here, there were 25-30 people nightly. People got along, PKs PK-ed. Chatters chatted. Wizzes were too busy coding or helping to lie, slander and fight. A lot of the good ones, like you, have been banished. No one can endanger the almighty Mangla's choke-hold on the MUD... \n\tWe need people who care, and people who are willing to work. If we want this to happen, we are going to need some useful admins. \n\tI have very little experience coding, but I would be happy to wiz and give it a shot if things were looking up. Ask anyone around though, I have always helped newbies out, coins, armour, walks around. \n\tI really hate to see this MUD fall apart, it is the only one that i have really played. I am just trying to say that I am willing to do my part if it means turning things back to how they were.\n\tI really don't care if this mail is wiz-read. I don't have a lot of fans in that section anyway, because I tend to speak up and tell the truth as I see it.\n\n\t\tKurt/Manson\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: need to talk to you\n\nDate: Feb  6\n\nI need to talk to you, it is really important.\n\nNot on here though.\n\nI can be found on backyard\namaterasu.math.orst.edu 1996 as Fairymoon\n\nIt is a chat line\n\n**\nhaplo\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: hiya\n\nDate: Feb 14\n\nHey i think you might be on the right track here. If you really want back\nI would suggest making a mailing to just the arches as an apology. And \nmaybe follow it up with a request to start off as a new wiz(just being a start)\nI still believe you could be good for the mud.\nPlease do not forward this to the other arches. I can be much more helpful\nIf I remain outside of everything (at least to most peoples eyes.)\n\n  Hey best of luck,\n\n   Haplo aka some guy named Mark\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: Reinstatement.\n\nDate: Jun  9\n\nHey man.\n\nI heard what you said before, and I can understand the way you feel.\nHowever, there's nothing I can do about it.  In the past month I've\nbeen demoted without word, had a sham of a vote about me being an \narchwizard, and to top it all off... my player file mysteriously vanished\nthis week.\n\nI told you after you apologized to me that I would no longer get in the \nway of you wizzing again, and I have stayed behind that.  I think that's \nwhat pissed off Napoleon, and why all these little unexplained occurances\nkeep happening.  \n\nW.\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: Harrassment\n\nCc: airborne silas sauron haplo kryll meecham\nDate: Jun 13\n\nHello,\n    Could you please cease your harrassment of me. I feel I have\ndone nothing to deserve this treatment. 80%+ of the items you\nlay the blame on me for I did not do and had no part of. This\ncontinual use of foul and abusive language is starting to wear\nthin. If you have nothing constructive to say, then please keep\nyour comments to yourself.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nnunu\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: HEY DUDE, I'm BACK\n\nDate: Jun 30\n\n\nYo TATSUO, \n\nWhat are you up to dude?\n\nI'm back!\n\nDrop me a note here, or at\nnunu@wam.umd.edu\n\n-Mike-\n(-NunU-)\n\n**\nhaplo\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: mail\n\nDate: Aug 13\n\nSure just as of past few months I have been deleting my mail. Truth be told I hopefully will be gone within 1-2 weeks and will retire. Not alot of time just this moment working obscene amount of hours. If all goes well before I leave somethign might happen.\n\n  Talk to ya.\n\n    Haplo\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nRe:   reopen ezo and ishikawa\nCc: wilbie airborne\nDate: Nov  3\n\nI was under the impression that much of Ezo is open. If not then\nplease let me know about the sizes of the current open areas, and\nwhat sizes you would like to redo/add. the only thing I though\nt was closed was much of the ninja guild halls and maybe the\ncaves.\n\nIshikawa can be a new project. I was not very familiar with the\nold one so I am not sure how it was layed out. It would be nice\nto have some new area, as always. Get the above two things open,\nthen we can talk more about the quest. this does not mean you\ncannot code special things into rooms in preperation for the quest,\njust that I do not want to say yeah or nay to quest without\ndiscussing it first.\n\nNinja guild is Warlord. Talk to him.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: Ezo etc\nCc: mangla\nDate: Nov  3\n\nAs far as I know, Ezo is completely open and complete.  Warlord has the ninja\nguild coming slowly but surely.  I have been doing some weapons for my \nFuzhou area that are ninja compatable (was working with Darastor on that).\nBecause we are implementing SAP here at work, I haven't done much but we're\nnow done implementing, so I will be coding a lot more now.\n\nAs far as Samurai/Ishikawa go, I will help out with whatever.  Actually, you\ncan put Fuzhou in Ishikawa.  It's a small fishing village.\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: mangla\nRe:   reopen ezo and ishikawa\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Nov  4\n\nI concur with Mangla on all points here.  Keep me updated on what you're\nworking on, I am always interested and willing to lend my opinions.\n\nAirborne\n\n**\nthumper\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: well that did the trick\nDate: Nov  4\n\nHello Old Friend,\nWell it seems our lil \"marriage of convience\" was just the thing\nto get exos off my back.  It was making him FUME th\nhubby.  oops ran off the page.  anyway thank you for helping\nme frost his arrogant ass.  \nHope to see you about more often now that you are rewizzed.\ncheryl/thumps\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: okay\nDate: Nov  6\n\nSounds okay to me... I think there's a hold on new guilds until the new ones\nare done anyway.  \n\nAs far as Ishikawa goes, I am pretty sure that the whole thing is still in\nHaplo's dir.  I was taking some files from there a few months ago.\n\nMail me some maps...  We can figure out how to split it up, and so forth.\nThe area I was kinda working on is loosly based on Aztec lore, but I can't\nseem to get going on it anyway.\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: pyramid\nDate: Nov 25\n\nIf you want to code a pyramid, how about this...  You code the inside of the\npyramid, monsters, and items.  I will code the surrounding desert, the outside\nof the pyramid, and maybe a groovy village.  We'll make it a long, arduous\ntrek to the pyramid, with heat stroke and wandering creatures...  But it \nwould be worth the effort for the player to get there.\n\n\n**\nbobo\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: marriage\nDate: Dec  7\n\nhey dude congratulations(I figure that everyone doesn't need to post).\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: stuff\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Jan 11\n\nYou're walking on a track through the village.

We don't have.[0m\n].[33mthe wizards we once had, and we don't have any arches on regularly to get .[0m.[33mthings.[0m\n].[33minstalled, fixed and player requests attented to..[0m\n\n]].[33mInstead we have exos sexually harassing female players, and people logging.[0m\n].[33mon to read the boards..[0m\n\n]\n]].[33mI know that you think i am damaged products, and my asking to get promoted.[0m\n].[33mback to arch just a stab at former glory..[0m\n\n]].[33mI am therefore not going to do that, but someone needs to be an arch .[0m.[33maround here.[0m\n].[33mbesides just you and a few others just in name.[0m\n]\n].[33mI would ask that you make wilbie and archwizard, because he is here, he .[0m.[33mcodes, he.[0m\n].[33mis a class one computer geek, working for state industrial chemicals in .[0m.[33mcleveland.[0m\n].[33mon their mainframe, and no one distrusts him..[0m\n\n]].[33mIt is true he is my friend, but you are gonna find that all i want is this .[0m.[33mplace.[0m\n].[33mto recover.  I hope you can start placing trust in some other people or HM .[0m.[33mwill.[0m\n].[33mnever go anywhere..[0m\n\n]].[33mLike on the summoner issue, you think that it is poorly coded guild, but .[0m.[33mguess what.[0m\n].[33meveryone likes the idea of them reopening, and they functioned without error.[0m\n].[33mfor 2 years while open..[0m\n\n]].[33mWilbie and I can get the ninja guild reopened at long last.[0m\n].[33mTurbo is around to code, and could tackle a guild at this point.[0m\n]\n].[33mThe three of us and yourself are the ONLY ones coding, and If i was running .[0m.[33mthe.[0m\n].[33mmud I would make those people arches, lords, and work with them..[0m\n]\n].[33mI can tell you now, i would not, and have never done anything to sabotage the.[0m\n].[33mmud,  and i was pushed away from here for a long time for something i .[0m.[33mdidn't do..[0m\n].[33mIf i seem bitter at times, i think i have the right to express it..[0m\n]\n].[33mI am not out to erase you or anyone else, save maybe exos, who should be .[0m\n].[33mbanned if you have a talk with thumper and other people he harasses.[0m\n]\n].[33mThere is no vendetta, just a desire to make my hobby, HM, return to a semi.[0m\n].[33msuccessful mud, and preserve it for as long as those of us who are .[0m.[33minterested can.[0m\n].[33mkeep it around..[0m\n\n]].[33mGive up a little control, delegate and give access, and you will see some .[0m.[33mwonderous.[0m\n].[33mthings happen to moral.

I let anyone work on anything they want\nto a great extent. If you care to \"tail /log/PROMOTE\" then\nyou will notice that I have cleaned\nup many of the older wizards. This is done about once a year to\nthose that have not logged on in a year or more and do not\nhave areas I have to worry about. I have also made a list of\nsome wizards that is thier areas are removed or redone, then I\ncan remove. Would you like to work on one of them?\n\nAs far as summoners, they need a looking over. If you have\never tried to read that code you would know some of the problems.\nI am not opposed to them if they are updated, just not in thier\ncurrent manifestation.\n\nWilbie will not be archwiz. I know it sound bad, but for\natleast the next little while I have no desire to have more\narchwizzes without seeing more work to get here. Wilbie, from\nthe times I have talked to him, has no desire to really advance.\nHe just wants to be here, create area and code cool things, and\nbe happy with his life.\n\nAs for suspecting you of cheating with that mail I have these\nreasons to ask you about the heals and such:\n  You are the first to do much of that besides me in the logs,\n    and I do check logs.\n  If I do not ask, and someone complains, then you will have\n    to listen to them and be a defendant. If I ask you up front\n    and you give me the answer, then it heads off the \"misinformed\"\n    complaints. I figured it was good cheer, I do it sometimes\n    also, but I just had to make sure.\n  I ask everyone that has entries like that. Standard policy.\n    does not mean you will be court martialed. ;)\n\nIf you have specific things you want to work on, or would like\nme to give you suggestions them please let me know. But these\nare things that YOU want, not that you think Wilbie wants. He\nis a big boy and can speak for himself.\n\nHope that answers some of the concerns.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nzathras\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: can you fix these things?\nCc: khufu\nDate: Jan 12\n\n players/turbo/rooms/elder/center1\nwhen you attack URZA &/or MISRA, sometimes there is a 0.

The 10k gold you get for slaying Garschmirak is quite pathetic. What\ndragon would have such a little hoard. THinking about this i got an idea.\nWhat if a monster of big caliber would guard a fountain that fulfills a wish\nif you drink from it. The wish could be for example an increasement in\na stat. Like +5 to anything you want, BUT not permanantly, just untill reboot,\nand one could have only one wish on a stat or maybe only one stat increasing\nwish at one time. You could also wish for experience and get some, like 50-100\nthousand, but the monster[s] guarding it would give much more, so it's only\nnominal, but it makes it more interesting. Eg if you alredy wished for a\nstat and an hour later you hack up all the guards again and couldn't wish for\na stat increasement you can wish for exp, or for a weapon or armor, and there\ncould be several different magic items available and when you wish for a weapon, you get a random weapon or one selected for your guild or whatever.\n                                             \nwell, see you\n                                              Ati\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: assassinate\nCc: bobo\nDate: Mar 11\n\nIt's absence was annoying players.

I have layed out many reasons why i want to be arch\nand i am consistantly put off and ignored.  The arches want to do everything behind \nclosed doors.  I am sending this letter to Mangla, who of all the arches, is the\nonly one that codes, and has been here, and who has admittedly pointed out that\nhe forgets things, and misses things, because of everything that needs done.\n\nCoding for HM is something that I enjoy to the fullest, but it has not been fun.\nAt every turn I have an archwizard speaking down at me, lying about me or at\nleast continuing an untrue rumor to others, THIS IS LOGGED, I have sent it to \nmangla.  We have archwizards who last coded 5 years ago.  We have archwizards\nwith outside commitments that take up space here.  We have archwizards that\ntake off 5 months and turn up like messiahs reasserting their rightful positions\nand casting down judgements. And we have one coding arch.\n\nFor 3 and one half years I watched the mud go through death throws, as players\nand wizards were driven off by shitty policies, guild closings, and the mud\nbeing moved around( all reasons I have heard).  Sauron, of the beloved\nninja guild had 3.5 years to recode ninja, he also had 3.5 years to\nput the monk into a bin system, and do something to balance it.  It just wasn't\ndone.  I do not know what he has done, but i can only speak of what wasn't done,\nand ask if opening and fixing these guilds was less important that what was done.\n\nThere was plenty of time for these people to \"shit or get off the pot\".\nIt wasn't done.  For those of you who do not know, or who have prescribed to\nthe rumors that abound.  I was banned by mistake.  I was kept away and put\noff without reason.  Untrustworty was heard. All sorts of things.\nFor the brief time i was unbanned, i was NEVER returned to my position,\nalthough it was a mistake that i lost it.  I was kept and treated as\na wiz with suspicion, and comments being made about me.  It sucked.\n\nI was restored to my position.  Airborne said it was a check on Mangla.\nMangla said it was to bring back HM.  Silas voted for me cause i asked him.\nIn the time that i made elder, I restored the ninja with wilbie, tinman,\nand bobo, restored the summoners with redsexy.  recruited and set up\n7 new Gm's, reviewed and opened 5 areas, coded a clan system, and fixed\n2 whole areas.  There is much more that needs done.  And i log on every\nday to find some social archwizard speaking down from above.  Or active\nones talking down about me or to me.  Telling me what is wrong with me, \nand refusing to listen to all the facts established about what is wrong\nwith what they have done.  I have done archwizard work.  I was an archwizard.\nI have used elder position to help everyone on here, even the assholes.\n\nMany other wizards have been inspired to come back, but that momentum is dying.\nThey have been put off, forgotten, while the ALL important archwizards\nsit back for a month to discuss things.  Redsexy was ignored for a year.\nHer area forgotten.  Bobo has done more coding than any other person\nat his rank, he is ignored and put off.  I don't blame him for cutting back.\nThere are wizards that are banished and wanted to come back, but they are\nignored.  And Exos is still here even after the testimony of 7 or 8 people\nattested to his absolute wrongdoings.\n\nAfter the ninja guild was restored, players and wizards started calling for\nnew archwizards with my name being mentioned many times.  These people were\ntold point blank to shut the hell up.  I have no conception of what\nyou arches have going on in that little room, and what bullshit ideas are\nfloating around.  But face it. One coding arch, isn't going to cut it.\nThe mud blew up in sargons workroom, understandings were reached, Then ignored.\nThat Tuesday came and went a month ago.  The old ways are no longer needed.\nWho is gonna help you put in the 100 level system? Airborne? Silas?\nKryll?, maybe Warlord and Uglymoth.  Maybe Sauron when he comes back from\nhis next extended vacation.  Hello, Tatsuo has the ability, and has shown it.\nThe mantras of me being some evil son of a bitch won't work forever when\nthey are demonstrably untrue.  You know what Redsexy is right, I am BOTH.\n\nI cannot fathom the resistance to the move when everything points to a positive.\nWhen there is a chance to remove the dead weight and move up the people\nthat are bringing back the players.  The momentum as you put it is starting to slip\nwith the players.  I can spark it back up.  I will claim responsibility\nfor a large percent of the comeback that is started.  I give the rest to the\npeople who have been ignored and put off.  From what i know, there are\npotentially 3 mudlib level coders on the game besides you Mangla.\nThose are your archwizards.\nTatsuo, Wilbie, and Sargon.\n\nPlease stop bogarting the highest position in the game when others can fill \nthose positions.  calling kryll to login hasn't made him come back and fix the\nplace. and saurons instant appearance also has done little but piss me off.\nPut the level where the level belongs.  With the people that code this place,\nand enjoy it.\n\nYou want the 100 level system in, arch those people.\nYou want the guilds running and balanced, arch those people.\nYou want players coming back, arch those people.\nYou want new players, arch those people.\nYou want wizards coding and being helped with code, arch those people.\nYou want Holy Mission back, arch those people.\n\nIf you want things the way they were. Sit back and dicuss things some more with\nthe deadbeats that brought her down.\nMake some changes, shake the boat. Take action, make it fun.\nIf not, I am outta here.  \n\nI have forwarded this to every wiz that gives a damn, and i will ask that\nthese wizzes write their feelings to MANGLA and cc it to TATSUO.  I want\na clean and open debate.  I also ask that it not be sent to other arches\nwhose feelings may be hurt by it.  That is not my intention.  I i have\nspoken an untruth, let it be known.  If i am right, tell mangla to fix the\nplace.\n\nTatsuo, for Holy Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**\nakira\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: mail\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nI recently reseved a letter that had some stronge statements made in it.\nOdds are you know the one I am talking about. We stand at a cross roads,\nit is no secret that this mud is dead, but there is hope. Recently the old\ncoders have returned, and with them some new players. This mud can be\ngreat once again. \"These are the time that try mens souls\" Henry V. I\nsay that because people don't seem to like change, it seems to try there\nsouls. Well its time to put the games aside and start to do what is best\nfor the mud. Tatsuo has shown that he can get things done. Why then do\nwe not let him do this. The answer would seem to be with the arches. I have\nno clue what you guys do, but I see what you don't do, and this is help\nthis place. We need new arches and new changes to be made. I FULLY suport\nthe ideas set forth by Tatsuo and some of the others wizes. Given this\nI stand with them and or walk with them, please let it be the former than\nthe latter.\n                                       Akira\n\n**\npsi\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo / Archwiz\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nWell I'm only a beginner, and actually this is the 1st MUD i've ever been on. And I may not know much about what all the details are, but I can say that Tatsuo is someone on here who I could immediately tell that he knew what he was doing.\nWhen there was a bug, Tatsuo fixes it. When we bump into each other, he converses with me. I constantly see him on here and he has never EVER said anything like \"Well hold on. I'm busy.\"\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding. But once I met people like Tatsuo and Redsexy who were this friendly, I haven't even tried one of the other 500 muds on this list of mine. That should show how attractive this place is. And if all the other Archwizzes made it what it is today, I'm sure those two can help make it what it will be tomorrow.\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding.

Let me start\nby saying this.  No matter how much we say that this is only a game, it is\nalso a great part of our lives.  I see the hours everyone puts in here and\nthere's no way any of us can deny that what goes on in the MUD effects\nwhat goes on in our lives.  I say this because everyone involved in this\ndebate is a friend of mine, one way or another.  I hope I haven't\ncome out as being too hypocritical in any of this.  I think I have\nstood up for what is right, and I think I have praised when praise\nhas been due and criticized when criticism is necessary.  But it\nis always the action I criticize, not the person behind it.\n\nSo I will say here what I have said to you all individually. And I will\nstart by praising what Tatsuo has done for Holy Mission.  He has\nturned the MUD around, that is undeniable.  I could go through the\nlist of things he has achieved (I'm sure he'd like me to do that)\nbut we all know what he has done here.  He is a motivational leader,\nwithout him I doubt I would have hung around for so long.\n\nI will also agree that the coding effort around here was appalling\nup until a few months ago.  Now Tatsuo and Sauron narrowly missed\neach other, but this much was obvious.  When Sauron went away\na LOT of projects fell by the wayside.  It was the final\nstraw in my prolonged absence (alongside my area not being looked at)\nand I know one or two others who had stuff going on that could\nonly be worked on with Sauron.  I think Tatsuo underestimates\nSauron's ability to code and the amount of stuff that is ready to\nship.  At the same time, in doing the lib stuff, monk was neglected.\nCoding here falls into two categories: The visible and the invisible.\nSauron was working on the invisible stuff RIGHT up till his\nabsence.  He was putting in 18 hours a day here some times. And not\njust socialising - far from it.  But there's no way monk \nshould have been left to rot for so long so visibly.  Gives\npeople the wrong impression.\n\nAnd as for Airborne and Mangla in the period up until I went away -\nI can't really comment.  Mangla was working with me on jedi, Airborne -\nI don't think I've seen Airborne code anything since 1993.  But\nmaybe he's the same as Sauron and keeps his achievements quiet?\n(actually that bit about Airborne - I *do* remember him recoding the\nBaal Rog quest).  But a revamped quest and new skills for one\nguild do not a happy MUD make.  Everyone was lax because HM was dying.\nIt took Tatsuo to wake some of us up to the fact that HM could be\ngreat again.\n\nTatsuo has livened up place, but in doing so livened up the arches.\nAnd now he too wants to be an arch.  But the arches have reservations.\n\nThis is where it all gets a bit blurry.  I hear one story from one side\nand then another story from Tatsuo.  I can understand the initial concern for\nnot making Tatsuo an arch.  He has a reputation.  He goes on crusades that\nwear everyone down.  There are questions about his coding ability. You never\nget a moment's peace when he is online.  And not forgetting the security\nconcerns.  The fact he doesn't tow the traditional arch-line.\nThe fact there are people he would remove within the second on promtion.\nAnd the biggest reason for Tatsuo not being arched of course.\n\"There are no arch positions\".  That brings me nicely onto Silas.\n\nWhat IS Silas doing now?  Why is he still an arch here?  OK I'm gonna stay\ncalm about this, but I would like to know if he is going to be inclided\nin the quarterly reviews.  Silas is one of the friendliest, nicest\npeople on here.  But if he's not doing anything for the MUD (as far as we\nare aware) then I really think that should be looked at.\n\nI sound like Tatsuo's yes woman.  I have disagreed with him on many things.\nI sometimes find he exaggerates statistics and his charisma can sometimes\nborder on the edge of manipulation.  But if he says fifteen players want\nsomething, he will go out and find those fifteen players who want it.\nAnd I'm not even saying Tatsuo should be your first choice arch.\nYou all know I'm not backing Exos on this either, Exos is, for all\nintents and purposes GONE.\n\nNow let me bring this back round to me and my life.  You may think\nI got involved in this because I like stirring trouble.  Or because I like\nthe sound of my own writing.  That's not the reason I got involved at all.\nFirst I saw Tatsuo personally attacking Mangla and I didn't like it.\nThen Tatsuo explained to me why he was attacking Mangla and I saw his\nreasons, but didn't approve of his methods.  Between us (and I hope he\ndoesn't mind me taking the credit a little) we worked that one out.\nBut things exploded again when Sauron came in.  Again I'm seeing Tatsuo\nfrustrated, and again I am getting mixed stories.  You know what?\nI've been here for eight years, I can barely remember what I got banished\nfor, let alone expect anyone else to remember.  I'd love to get you\nall in a room together and tell me exactly what you've all told ME\n(er - make that tell each other what you've all told me).\n\nCommunication is the key that is missing here.\n\nTatsuo.  Look at what Sauron has done as opposed to knocking him for stuff\nhe didn't do.  Try talking to the arches without insulting them.\n\nArches, the whole lot of ya.  Listen to Tatsuo.  Don't arbitarily threaten\nhim with banishment. Yes, I know I have suggested banishment myself.\nAnd I still go with that.  If you are not going to Arch him then banish him.\nYou're going to say that you have listened to Tatsuo.  I know you're going\nto say that you've had as much Tatsuo as you can take.  The thing is,\nas many different viewpoints of an event there are, there is only one set of\nfacts.  Someone along the way is lying or seriously mislead in their beliefs.\n\nEveryone.  Please treat each other with respect.  Do not judge without\nhard facts.  Do not launch into mindless attacks on each other.  I can\nhonestly say I haven't said anything to anyone that I would be ashamed\nof having distributed.  I will gladly sit in a room with you all\nand defend everything I've said here.\n\nIf Tatsuo goes, and seeing as Exos is as good as gone, who are we going\nto have left?\n\nI guess I'll start work on master.c now then?\n\nRed\n\n**\nsargon\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo's mail\nCc: redsexy, tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nHere are my thoughts. \nBasically this can be broken down into 2 parts.\n1.  Current status of arches and their contributions.\n2.  Tatsuo's desire to be Arch\n\n1.  The current satus of arches is not great.  We have two active arches and one who codes.\n  Mangla has been here through thick and thin and has taken a ton of shit from every \ndirection.  I've had very few problems with him that haven't been worked out.  \nHe has \nasked for my advice on issues and gotten it and he's given me coding help many times. \n He is approchable and open to new suggestions that are workable.  He holds the highest \ncredibility with me...i can't speak for others.  This is my experience with Mangla.\nIn my view the single most important quality of being a wizard or arch wizard is\n\ncredibility.  People can be taught to code, but honesty and a solid recognition of right and \n\nwrong are things that one needs to have as a foundation.  Without it they should not be wiz \n\nor arch.  There are many things which have been promised and not accomplished and \n\npinning the blame on Mangla is at once unfair and misdirected.  There are/were 4 other \n\narches who also promised these things.  Mangla cannot be expected to bear the brunt of all \n\nof their shortcomings.   As I said, he has stuck it out and coded while other arches didn't. \n \nTo remove or want Mangla removed is arrogant and stupid.\n\n\n\n2.  Tatsuo asks that if he has spoken an untruth in his mail to us that we bring it up.  I \nwon't say that he's delibrately misled, but I will say that he has distorted some facts, \nintentional or not.  First, Exos and I had been looking into the guild master problem for \nsome time and i've approached Mangla concerning this problem even before Tatsuo was \nback.  I told Mangla that I would like to be GM of fighter guild and recruit Bobo and \nWilbie to look into other guilds that have been missing GM's.  I wanted Red to do Jedi \nalso.  Even though Tatsuo has done an enormous amount to get HM back and enstill \nenthusiasm here again there are things that others have been doing before and now continue \nto do...just because we don't post on every little thing we do doesn't mean it isn't being \ndone.  So actually, Tatsuo exagerates the point of Gms.\n\n\tTatsuo also exagerates of the review of areas.  There were many of us involved in \nreviewing areas, specifically Redsexy's.  Not that Tatsuo didnt' contribute to this, more or \nless than others, but his point is that HE did it alone.  This is also an exageration.\n\n\tAsk yourself this;  If someone told you 10 things and 2 were exagerations or false, \nand these things you know about, what are you to think of the other 8 things they tell you?  \nCredibility IS the issue.  Tatsuo may be capable of being Arch in technical areas, but he \nleaves too many questions in other areas.  He should be promoted to Arch only when he \nhas demonstrated that he can be trusted to be stable and credible.  In my opinion, he must \nbe able to work with Mangla.  He can do all these things.  When he does, I will put in my \nsupport for him as an arch.\n\n\tAs for the rest of the mail from Tatsuo, I will not respond.  I will only discuss \nmatters of which I have first hand knowledge and won't get into dragging anyone in the \nmud.\n\n\tThese are my opinions.\n\n\n  Sargon\nHope the format is easy to read...copying into mailer was a pain.\n\n\n**\ntinman\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nI think what tatsuo says is true.  the mud died because of all the changes\nand being a arch here you have responsibility.  And people who lack the\nresponsibility should be taken off arch immediately.  Once people see\nhow great hm was and what it really was.  I can even say i left hm because\nof lack of work being done and no one gives a damn about the mud but Tatsuo\ncan make a difference.  He made me realized the mud can change.  Therefore\ni have help him with the ninja guild.  He show me many things that can\nbe added to improve hm.  I say why don't we just give tatsuo a try.  \nare you afraid of him??  if so, you can watch him and see his ability\nto work. you will find your suspiouicans are wrong.  This mud will die\nagain and make all the people here lost hope if nothing is being done.\nI have talk to a few people about hm.  they say the arch doesn't care\nabout the mud anymore and at the moment they have saw tatsuo making\nchanges which made people come back.  and actually take a look at this place.\nLet us not neglect hm again.  Give Tatsuo the arch position.\n\nTinman\n\n**\nthumper\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Holy Mission\nCc: tatsuo, sargon\nDate: Mar 22\n\nMangla,\nI see by the files that exos still exists on HM.  I would\nhave thought that after all the complaints that you got that\nthis matter would have been delt with by now.  I would ask why\nyou are dragging your feet on this, but knowing your responses\nin the past I would just get more of the same.  BS from an Arch\nwho does little to punish wrong doings, and lets those who are\ntrying to get this mud up again flounder on thier own.  Tatsuo\nhas done much to get HM standing again and to get new blood\nhere.  Yet you still put off making him an Arch. WHY? Are you\nso insecure that you feel threatened by him.  You have Arches\nhere who are missing half the time, and the other half they\njust wish to be social.  This place needs a heart transplant and \ngetting rid of dead arches who could care less would be a step\nin the right direction.  (You know when I first came to HM it\nwas awsome. Half the time it was so full I had to wait to log in.\nNow , well lets just say there is room to spare. I personally can't\nbelieve this is what you want for a mud where you are an arch.)\nSometimes change is good mangla, it does not need thinking about, \nor committees.  Just DO IT!\nWould you want to be a player here?\nThumper\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: this arch stuff\nCc: sargon, akira, uruz, tatsuo, bobo, tinman, redsexy, airborne\nDate: Mar 22\n\nLeaving all personal issues aside, and leaving all political bullshit aside,\nI think Tatsuo and the others who have spoken up have some good points.\nWhether that means new arches or just new roles for lower levels, the fact\nremains that we need change.\n\nRight now we have one active arch.  In order to accomplish everything that \nneeds to be done here, that just won't do.  We either need new arches or the\narches need to pass on some roles to the elders.  It's very simple.\n\nThis is not a rip on Airborne, or any other arch.  Actually, let me rephrase\nthat part...  This is not a rip on Airborne, but it IS a rip on the others.\nAirborne still logs in, and he still makes a visible effort.  But the fact\nremains that Mangla is the only arch who plays a primary role in Holy Mission.\nMangla makes the decisions.  Mangla makes the policy.  Airborne acts as sort\nof a check - just to keep things balanced.\n\nAs for the other arches, how in the hell can a person be considered an arch\nwhen they never log on and do anything?  Popping in now and then to vote on\nsomething that you don't even care about doesn't count.\n\nThis is also not a rip on Mangla.  Personally, I have no problem with Mangla.\nThe problem I have is that Mangla (purposely or not) has placed the entire\nMud on his shoulders.  One person just doesn't cut it.  It doesn't matter if\nyou have the best intentions in the world.  One person does not make a mud.\n\nPersonally, I think Tatsuo would make a very good arch.  Quite frankly, I \nthink a great number of the people we have right now would make great arches.\nLet's stop thinking of the \"arch\" position as some elite rank.  It's just \nanother level with more work involved.  If someone has the ability, and the\ndesire, they should be given the opportunity to do the work.  \n\nThey certainly have more business with that rank than someone who never\nlogs in.\n\nOne last thing, for the record.  I don't want to be an arch.  If raising my\nlevel will help me help this mud then yes, I'm all for promotion.  Promote\nme to whatever I can best help you with.  To me, that's all rank is.  It's\naccess to do more good for the Mud.\n\n**\ntetsuhara\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: Archood\nCc: mangla\nDate: Mar 22\n\nwell....lots of things said in all that.......\nhaving been a player for the better part of six years i think i've seen a lot\nof what's gone on from the players perspective..... although this doesn't\ngive me authority to say whats gone on behind the scenes as it were, its\nstill painfully obvious to anyone who plays for an extended period that things\naren't running as smoothly as they should.....\n\nfrom the point of view of the work done by wizzes, elders and arches.... there\nis definitely a trend towards who is actually working and who is on for the more\nsocial aspects of the mud...\n\ncredit given where its due... given the amount of time elapsed since tatsuo's\nbanning and subsequent re-instatement (well almost) isn't it obvious that  \nthe fears of wrong-doing were ill-founded?\n\non the subject of propsing wizzes or elders that should be arches... i must\nadmit that i was more than a little peeved at being slapped down for the suggestion.....\nconsidering that a lot of players log far more time on the mud at the moment\nwould'n't it make sense to take on board suggestions rather than dismissing\nthem out of hand?  one would almost think that these players didn't have the\nexperience and the prior knowledge of the way the mud operates to make a\nsimple nomination......\n\n\nanyway.... there's some more two-cents worth of opinion......\n\ntets.\n\n**\nwidge\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo 4 arch\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 23\n\nDear Mangla\nWell having read all that Tats had to say, I can honestly back him up for the position of arch wiz. Like Psi says, Tatsuo is a very nice guy who always has time to talk and basically doesnt treat us lower level players (like me LL1) like we are worth \nnothing. I have noticed that many arches and those high up (I dont refer to you here, i hardly know you) have disregarded the mud and only use their posotion for their own advantage.\nTatsuo to me seems more than capable of fulfilling the role of arch, he is on here regularly, and I sincerely hope that he is promoted. As he says, one particular arch, Exos, seems to do nothing but use his position for his own advantage, snooping on us \nplayers when we might well be engaged in some very private conversations, like myself.\nThis is a very serious concern of mine, and its making me think of leaving the mud again if this matter is not addressed. Indeed others ma be doing the same thing, and whats worse is that us players have no way of knowing.\nI think Tatsuo would make a trustworthy arch who would not abuse his position. I believe Tatsuo can encourage people to like and trust the mud and its people again, like myself. \n\nTatsuo for arch ...........restore the mud to its former glory, banish those high up who do nothing for it.........lets make it enjoyable for everyone NOW\n\n**\nati\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo/arch\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 23\n\nHello Mangla!\n\nTatsuo asked me to write to you what i think about his request to become\nan archwizard. I've read the letter he wrote to you about this topic.\nThe 'political' part of it does not interest me, as politics on muds\nnever did as long as they didn't hurt me.\nThe part that's about thet \nthet=that is about that Tatsuo would like to take resposibility in coding\nthe lib does interest me howerver. As far as i know Tatsuo is a skilled\ncoder, and what is at least this important is that he has the time to\ncode here.\nThe last time when there was noticeable coding on HM (at least for me)\nwas at the time when Llort was still here and coding the mages guild.\nThis is all i have to say, and i think it's quite enough.\n                                    Ati the somewhat faithful player of HM\n\n**\n"
