I wanted to make this request of all \nof you.  I am sorry if i could not included everyone as I brought up\nmost of your names from memory.\n      I was removed banished because Herp was told on the wizline \nby Leslie that It was me who had altered his prison file.\nLeslie said this because i was mentioning the abuse of the\nprison file earlier that day.  I have made almost no attempt\nto reinstate my self in the last few months but I am coming\nto the point where I really miss being here and talking with most\nof you.  When I was here I made a difference.  I want to do so again\nMy life has settled down and I am no longer in transition.  I hold\nthe postion of General Manager and Partner of Hawk Manufactured Housing\nbased in Warren PA and have recently opened the 5th Sanchin Karate Academy \nthere.  But anyway.\nI have sent mail to Herp explaning everything that transpired and trying\nto clear up the whole mess.  I need support.\nI would like to ask each and every one of you to mail a short message\nto Herp.  Say what you can.  If only that you believe what happened \nwas a mistake and you would like to see Tatsuo unbanished.\nI am counting on each one of you.  I hthink I have helped each one \nof you over the years and I REALLY WANT TO COME BACK.\nplease drop me a mail if you sent something so i can keep track.\nThank You,\n         David Grant Goodman, AKA Tatsuo\n           814-226-7228\n\n**\nnemchinov\n**\nTo: countvlad\nSubj: yer cool\n\nCc: kovalev\nDate: Aug 17\n\ni like you\nemail me or mudmail me\nemail addy nemmy@netcom.com\n*hugs*\nGA\n\n**\nkovalev\n**\nTo: nicky\nSubj: sigh\n\nCc: kovalev, nemchinov\nDate: Sep 10\n\n=================== Holy Mission: Tue Sep 10 16:04:25 1996 ===================\nLvl Sex Name       Where in the World   Lvl Sex Name       Where in the World\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n 11  m  Korose     Sydney, Australia    Eld  m  Nylakoorub Potsdam NY, USA\n  1  m  York       Budapest, Hungary     12  f  Kovalev    # <163>,<238>\nNew  m  Gorlin     Vienna, Austria        6  m  Avron      # <194>,<109>\nNew  m  Dragonn    Jonesboro GA, USA     22  m  Brebane    # <206>,<96>\n \n============== 8 players online, 0.63 cmds/s, 5.14 comp lines/s ==============\n \n-------- Please mail Sauron if your location is incorrect or not shown -------\n donno if you got this already\nlook at dragonn site\njonesboro GA\njust curious if he hacked yer account\ni hope he didnt\ni think yer the only Georgian on here\nGotta go\nGA\n\n**\nkovalev\n**\nTo: kovalev\n Re:   sigh\nDate: Sep 10\n\n\n**\nnicky\n**\nTo: kovalev\n Re:   sigh\nDate: Sep 10\n\nI don't know how that happened GA.... bogs at that conc\n\n**\nnicky\n**\nTo: kovalev\n Re:   draggonn.\nDate: Sep 12\n\nThen mail someone who is a high wiz about it there is nothing I an tell you of how it is happening\n\n**\nblaarg\n**\nTo: nemchinov\nSubj: heya hun\n\nCc: kovalev\nDate: Sep 26\n\ndidn't see you today so i'll send you mail :)\nttyl love :)\nTristan :)\n\n**\ngorlin\n**\nTo: nemchinov\nSubj: hi\n\nCc: kovalev\nDate: Oct  9\n\nhi... sorry that i had to leave, the system crashed\ni'll try to get on again later (have to leave again soon,\ncause i'm using a friend's computer)\nhope to see you soon (few hours?)\nlove you, andreas\n\n**\nbobo\n**\nTo: seafarer\nSubj: erm\n\nCc: nemchinov kovalev\nDate: Oct 11\n\n\nso earlier today...or tommorow by your standard...er yesterday....anyways\nwe got cut off in our tlak because of the fact that i had to go abrptly\n...anyway my train of thought went buh bye so i'll just put it this way\ni don't think that you told me anything after i said i don't know\nwhen/ or where i'm going so if you could that'd be great :)\noh btw i'm forwarding this to all your characters that i know\nof...which isn't many :)\n\n**\n"
