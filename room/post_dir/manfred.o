I know that\nsome of you, including myself, don't find Exos all that agreeable. Frankly,\nI could write the code and give it to a wiz to input for us but then they\nwould just be a coding monkey and wouldn't really have any meaning for bein'\nour immortal member. I think Figleaf would be a good nomination for it for\nseveral reasons, one he's one of the Sheriff's on the place and if we're\ngonna be pking it'd be nice to have him on our side, 2 he was once a member\nof ::NETHED:: so we know he is down with the program, 3 he's a nice guy and\na good coder. well I guess that would be 4 too. That'd be my nomination for\nour immortal member, I don't know if he would do it because he IS the rules\nsheriff for the place but we can give it a shot. If y'all have any other \nnominations, this isn't a dictatorship, we can vote on who we want to ask.\nGuarantee I will veto any request for Exos though >:) That's news from\nyour fearless leader. Lemme know what y'all think.\n\nRelgar, a.k.a.
