Of those, I doubt that Louie will (hasn't logged on since Sun Oct\n27 22:46:43 1996) and I don't think Margusko is really a candidate. If any\nof the others log on, you can talk to them and test them if they are still\nserious about coding. Remind them that we do expect them to be actively coding\nan area, and that there is the strong chance that they will only have a limited\namount of time to code an area (I am thinking about imposing a 6 month time\nlimit for all Newwiz to code areas or be demoted).\nThanx for doing this - I've never been overly enthusiastic about doing appr ->\nnewwiz tests. :) Let me know how things go.\n\nDave\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: haplo\nSubj: another appr\nDate: Mar  4\n\nTsubaki logged on recently after a fairly long absense, so you might want to\nkeep an eye out for him as well, or just mail him and find out if he intends\nto remain active here or not.\n\nDave\n\n**\ndorr\n**\nTo: haplo\nRe:   Hello\nDate: Apr 28\n\nThnks you for your mail.\nI didn't took it as an insult, because you didn't wrote it\nlike an insult.

The girl has been \nat my throat for years now, and it's just getting \nridiculous!! For more imput, read the thief board...\nIt's just outta hand.

This is still an official attempt to reverse the clamety that lead to\nmy unwilling departure from this most excellent mud.\n\nACK, not that It is threating living in close proximity, but you can realize\nthat Tatsuo is just too incredibly cool to keep banned. Ask airborne, i \nentertain him all the time.\n\nAnyway, I thought i remembered you living in Greenville about 15 minutes from here.\nSo i said, what the hell.\n\nLater\nTatsuo\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Mentors\nCc: sauron, airborne, haplo\nDate: Sep 11\n\nSmorlok has asked me to be his mentor (stop laughing!).  What exactly is\nthe process?  Does he ask one of you arch-types to promote him to apprentice\nfirst, or does he ask me to ask you?  I never had a mentor...  I think you\nbanished him or something :)\n\nAnyway, he says he can code, and he's on quite a bit, and I've never heard of\nhim being a problem...\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: wilbie\nRe:   Mentors\nCc: arches\nDate: Sep 12\n\nBeing a mentor means you agree to support and help\nhim when he is learning to code. If you agree to be his mentor\nthen you will set the mentor quest to him. this tells the\narches that you are prepared to stand behind him and push\nhim over the cli...err push him in the right direction.\n\nBefore you set the mentor quest, review his qualifictions\nas far as wizzing goes. Does he have the percentage to wiz?\nDoes he have the XP needed? Is he old enough?\n\nThen he will have ot ask the aches for permission to wiz.\nWe will set the ask_god quest to him and then he will\nbe able to go to his guild and advance wiz.\n\nThat about sum it up?\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Smorlok\nCc: sauron, haplo, airborne\nDate: Sep 12\n\nHe's got the age, and at Legend 20 I think he's got the experience.  Most \nimportantly (to me anyway) he seems like he wants to code some cool areas\nand help out the mud.  So I did the mentor thing.\n\nHe's coded on HM2 (don't hold that against him - a lot of us did) and he says\nhe has coded on others as well.  I am planning to be here quite a bit more,\nunless things at work get really screwed - we're replacing a mainframe\nwith an SAP/WinNT network and it's deadlined at November 2nd :)\n\nAnyway, I will help him as much as a I can, and HM has always been easy to \nget a handle on.  I think he'll make a great wizard.\n\nWilbie\n\n**\ntats\n**\nTo: airborne\nSubj: uo\nCc: haplo, sauron\nDate: Sep 13\n\n\nI seemed to have lost my \"uo\"\n\nCan one of you help me get it back?\n\nTats - uo\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: kryll\nRe:   healing\nCc: arches\nDate: Oct 29\n\nI agree with raising the cost of healing.  I think that we should \ndo whatever we can to me the mud more challenging for players, and \nthat the abundance of healing definately has something to do with \nthat. 40-60 gold per HP for a carried is not unreasonable, however\nwe need to look at how that balances with guild regenerative abilities\nas well.  Once we limit the availability of portable healing, suddenly\nany guild that offers healing is considerably more potent.  I think if \nwe do things like this that we should perhaps balance meditation skills\nwith something like 'can only meditate in a temple'... with that being \njust one example.\n\nW.\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: airborne\nRe:   healing\nCc: arches\nDate: Oct 31\n\nI don't know that we should remove all meditation outside of a 'temple' but\nmaybe we could reduce the healing rate outside of that player's guild rooms.\nSeems to me that being in their temple, or at their shrine, or whatever,\nshould heal them faster, or conversely, being away from there should heal\nthem slower (since we want to reduce the healing, not increase it).\n\nDave\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: haplo\nFwd:  healing\nCc: arches\nDate: Nov  1\n\nTo: airborne\nRe:   healing\nCc: arches\nDate: Oct 31\n\nI don't know that we should remove all meditation outside of a 'temple' but\nmaybe we could reduce the healing rate outside of that player's guild rooms.\nSeems to me that being in their temple, or at their shrine, or whatever,\nshould heal them faster, or conversely, being away from there should heal\nthem slower (since we want to reduce the healing, not increase it).\n\nDave\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: haplo\nSubj: healing...\nCc: arches\nDate: Nov  1\n\nSorry about that, zigged when I should have zagged.\n\nHere's the idea that I have been bouncing about in my head.  \n\nOk, suppose we limit meditation/healing skills to only the guild room\nand \"shrines\".  Then we give guild members the ability to create \nshrines in various locations.  Players will be able to have their \nhealing, but they would have to work a bit for it.  \n\nTo start, we'd have the shrine needed to be built.  An easy way to\nget players to spend a bunch of gold on all sorts of things, bowls, \nstatues, insense, etc.  Then they would have to protect those locations\nonce they were built.  Certainly leaving lots of valuables laying \naround would tempt almost any player, which would kinda be the point.\nAdd in the idea that some elements of theshrine would degrade with\ntime (insence comes to mind) and have to be replaced every so \noften.  \n\nThe idea is to create an economy by finding reasons for players to gather\nor purchase things that aren't just for killing.  If insence were only\navailable in a small handful of locations, and there was a demand for it\nwe'd create the demand.  It helps control healing rates, keeps money\ndown a bit, adds a roleplaying element to the mud, and encourages guilds\nto work together.\n\nIdeas and critics?\n\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: exos\nSubj: Attitude\nCc: arches\nDate: Nov 16\n\nIf you have a problem with people then take it up\nwith them in private. This continued harangueing of\nothers on the public boards is getting out of hand.\nSit back, take a deep breath and lets get on with more\nsensible things.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: ezo coast\nCc: arches\nDate: Mar  9\n\nI had to fix up players/tatsuo/ezo/coast/genCoast.c\nthis morning. This is the second day in a row that\nareas of Ezo would not load. Please be more careful when\nchanging things. All errors are simple. Missing ;\nor extra \" and in this case one of the problems was\na function redefinition.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: arena\nCc: exos, arches\nDate: Mar 19\n\nI had another though. If we get enough people. I would not\nmind seeing two arena a day when it makes sense. But the\nsecond arena would be open for lower levels. So be careful\nwhen opening the arenas, and if there are more lower levels\non then exclude the higher levels, or have two.\n\nthe syntax, in case you had/have problems is:\nopen arena <min>-<max>\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: thumper\nSubj: Exos\nCc: arches\nDate: Mar 22\n\nI have a set of complaints, and we are watching to catch\nhim in the act. So far the only act was have caught him in\nis talking to kitty. Nothing threatening. If he is guilty,\nthen he will slip up. At that time, caught red-handed,\nwe will do it. Have some patience. It will be addressed.\n\nAs for Tatsuo. That will be taken care of in its own\ntime also. There are many many facts that have been\nleft out. There are no insecurity issues.\n\n-Mangla\narches\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: sargon\nSubj: Promotions\nCc: arches, tinman, shadowmonk, brainsprain, redsexy, bobo, turbo\nDate: Mar 31\n\nAs was promised, the promotions have been made.\nThanks for your time and patience.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: turbo\nSubj: bard skill\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr  8\n\n     One of the bard skills somehow allows a bard to sidestep a backstab.\nThis does not make snese to me, how can you sidestep an attack that\nyou do not know is coming, it is not even like the bard guild is a guild who \nis incredibly dextrious.  If there is a valid skill reason for this, I\nwould like to know, otherwise it should be changed, thieves are meant\nto rely on this one skill, backstab, for most of their damage and it is\na onetime only attack, if it is going to be blocked by your guild\nI need to decide what that means towards my guilds skills\n\nBrainsprain\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: brainsprain\nRe:   bard skill\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr  8\n\nskill?  I can think of a spell, irish luck, but a skill?\nIrish luck has a LONG recast time, and from my understanding of it\ngives AT BEST 15 dodges.  While this may seem like a lot,\n\nkeep in mind that the shadow lasts longer than 9000 seconds, \nwhich is the MAX time for their Armour of ithan.\n\nAlso, how did this come to be known?\nWhy was a thief backstabbing a bard to begin with.\nOh, and as far as not know its comming, that is why its called\nIrish Luck.  Luck can account for a lot of things, including \navoiding an attack you do not see coming.  While the message this dodge\nreturns may not be descriptive of the attack,\nthat does not disqualify it.\nAfter all, as a player, I have pounded skeletons into a pile of blood\nand body parts many times.\n\nThe message may be innaccurate, but the effect is the same.\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: turbo\nSubj: in reply to both\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr  8\n\nYeah, arches will mail all of the arches, i think wizzes works as well\nto send to everybody.\n\nAs to to skill or spell, that is fine, what happened was malice and treat\nwere in the arena and I was watching the battle over malices shoulder.\nI watched treat sidestep a backstab, which made no sense whatsoever to me.  When i asked him how he did it\nhe refused to cooperate, so i asked him if it was a skill, and if it was\nthat it would suffice, he told me it was a skill, so i asked him what \nthat skill was, he wouldn't tell me (telling me, of course, would have\ns\nsettled this without you and I even having to discuss it, I think this is,\nbtw, a very valid skill.  \n\nThanks for the info, i wont be coding around the spell, i think it is very valid,\nbut I do have one question: What level does a bard have to be\nin order to get that skill and does it take the attackers level\ninto account, I think it should, that way lvl 22 bards arent dodging attacks\nfrom L10 thieves (just an example).  \n\nThanks turbo\n\nThe sprain\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: haplo\nSubj: First goldsun area\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr 14\n\nI have revised the first of goldsun's area .. the poorly named\n7-islands (since there are only 6)  However, I have my own\narea, a huge island, that i am going to rebuild into the \n7th island.
