I would like to\nbe considered for a promotion to Elder.  I am excellent at fixing bugs,\nand my coding is quite good (when I actually apply myself and take it seriously :) )\nPlus its always good to have someone else with access to most files in /players\nfor bug fixing and all, rather than bugging Arches all the time :)\n\nSo consider me a serious volunteer.

However, when I would\nget killed, the code in living.c is such that I stop\nfighting (in the do_die() function) but the monster will\ncontinue. This results in the monster giving 'miss' msgs,\nand the occasional 'monster died' msg (from attack() function).\nI don't think this is as it should be. However, if you are\nof a different opinion, I'd like to hear it.\n\nSecondly, even though I haven't checked it to the last byte,\nI'm having some probs with poison. If I call add_poison( 10 )\n(or whatever value) in myself, I don't get the 'you suffer\nfrom poison' msgs from heart_beat() and query_poisoned()\nalways returns 0. I'm still looking at it, but maybe you\nhave an answer right away?\n\nThanks in advance and see you around,\n\nUglymouth\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: sauron\nSubj: would like to\nCc: arches\nDate: Feb 11\n\nI would like to redo I link area that has continuity errors in its desc\nand directions.  /players/apollo/link/aqua*\n\nThanks\nSaffrin\n\n**\nbobo\n**\nTo: sauron\nSubj: area\nDate: Mar 14\n\nthe redone area is in /players/bobo/krooms/vill\n\neverything should work but everyone says that when they think they are finished\nwith a project eh?\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: sauron\nFwd:  kelly's area\nDate: Mar 18\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: kelly's area\nCc: bobo\nDate: Mar 14\n\nok have recoded red rock junction once again...now you can QC it and tell me\nif you are going to run it out of my dir, also what i want to know is the\nrest of the area has been blocked off and nothing was put in about it.

I think that the\nreason that players aren't interested in quests is bacause they don't need\nquests to advance their level, and the current quests are poorly written  \nand hard to solve without help. Hack'n'slash is big because that's all    \nplayers have to do. Wizards know that quests aren't important and so they\ndon't write new ones.\n\nWhat we need are a new set of areas and quests that make players think,\nand not just wander around killing everything in sight. Getting quests \nback into the advancement procedure is vital.\n\nAnother problem we have with this mud is that the lib is outdated... way\noutdated. To hopefully solve this, or at least help keep things moving, I\nam in the process of rewriting large chunks of the lib. I have rewritten \nall wiz commands, and will start on the player commands (and the help    \nfiles) soon. Uglymouth has been working on the man pages, but he has been\ninactive lately, so I might take over that as well. I am also rewriting  \nall of the main inheritable files, hopefully making them easier to use and\nunderstand, and allowing more people who don't know (and don't want to\nknow) alot of LPC to contribute and create imaginative areas.\n\nKryll has been working on a totally new guild system which will allow\nmulti-guilding with specialization. I know he's not been around much \nrecently, but he lost his job, moved to a new state, got a new job, got\nmarried... so I think we can give him some slack. :) This will hopefully\nrevitalize things further and make playing fun again. He and I are also  \nworking on rewriting the living/player code to make everything work\ntogether. This includes rewriting things like combat (including the\narmour/weapon code), races and religion.\n\nWhat I would love to do is get all the wizards to work with the new\ninheritables (once I finish them) and create brand new areas/quests with\nthe ultimate aim of scrapping the existing world alltogether and\neffectively making a new HM. However this will take alot of time and\nco-operation from people, and right now that doesn't seem to be\nforthcoming. What I might try and instigate is a new continent... we can \nleave the existing one 'as is' (just fixing bugs) and start work on a    \nbrand new location. Players could choose to log in to either the old or  \nthe new continents, and there would be transportation between the two    \n(boats and dragon airways spring to mind as two existing options). This   \nnew continent would be more spread out and it's geography would be planned\nso that areas of vastly differing location types aren't placed next to\neach other. You can type 'map' on HM for one such plan that I wrote last\nyear. My virtual area code will allow us to easily create 'filler' areas\nto pad out the map until we have enough areas to do the job.\n\nThe above has focused mainly on what is wrong here from a code point of \nview. I know that the lack of players doesn't help motivate the coders to\ncontinue, but I firmly believe in three points:\n\n1. There is no point atracting in new players until we fix up the code of\n   the mud... All that will happen is that we will lose the new players\n   again (they may be PKed alot, or they may sense the frustration and\n   futility from the wizards or whatever...) and then it will be doubly \n   hard to get more new players if we ever do fix up the mud.   \n\n2. If we do not fix up this mud's code, it will die. There are too many\n   good new muds out there, let alone all the graphical online games that\n   are springing up, for a 6 year old 2.4.5 mud to survive without radical\n   changes.\n\n3. We are all here to have fun - players and wizards alike. If it ceases  \n   to be fun, then maybe it is time to move on.\n\nMy suggestion would be to spend as much time as you feel you want to\nhere... I would like to think that you could help me with some of the   \nabove, along with John (Texas) and Simon (Dworkin), and people like\nKryll, Mangla and Warlord who want to turn this mud around again. However,\nif RL seems more appealing, then go for it. :) I only code consistently on\ntwo muds these days... I don't have the enthusiasm or loyalty to code for\nmore (I've tried). The other mud I code for is still in alpha phase, so it\nhas no players at all - even more boring. :)\n\nIf you really want to move to another mud, I can point you in the\ndirection of one that I code for occasionally, but I would much prefer it\nif you helped me get this place moving again.\n   \nHope to talk to you soon.\nDave\n\n**\nmontoya\n**\nTo: demolian\nSubj: Contact Email Address\nCc: sauron, daniella, darastor, jewel\nDate: Apr 26\n\nYo Guys and Girls.... this message is going out to quite a few of you\nsome of whom I've run into, other I've missed so I hope it's the same\npeople using the names as I remember, if not sorry and please ignore\nthis message.\n\nAnyway, Your friendly Neighbourhood Spaniard is back, although how\noften I'm not sure, but I have a contact email address which you can\nuse, but please bear in mind that it's a sub-account of someone else's\n(so what's new?) so I don't know how quickly I'll be able to reply,\nbut I promise to do my best (for what it's worth).\n\nSo Here Goes (wait for it....)  -  montoya@lineone.net   (Heheheh!!)\n\nAnd to those who I haven't seen in person - HI !!!! *HUGS*\n\nInigo  (aka Owen).\n\n**\nparis\n**\nTo: sauron\nSubj: Life ...\nDate: May  6\n\nWell as it seems to be easier to catch you here than else where *grin*\nI'm going to be, hopefully, building a redhat 4.2 box this weekend, so\nwe can run a linux on it and things should compile, tried compiling it\non sunos and sco and both time err'd so i think its due to it calling\nsome linux specifics...\n\nAside from that, got a little problem that i'm having a bit of \nhassle over - well i cant think of a neat way of doing ti.

HOpe all is well with you and Yen?  Things here are pretty good.  As you know, Peter graduated last Friday with jhis Bachelor's degree in computer science, and now he's only got one more week of living in NJ before he heads out to Seattle nest Saturday.  At least he leaves here then, and should arrive there with the truck and his three friends in five days.  It'll be interesting to see how things go!  He was just here this evening for supper and to help me move some furniture and then he went to NY to visit Mike and to say goodbye.  Cathi's coming home tomorrow, as we have a family wedding to go to.  She's going to London for a week in August....as for me, I cancelled my trip to Vermont in June as I lost the mood for going.  Instead I'm finally going to start painting the house here.  Don't know what I'm going to do with my two weeks off in the summer....probably will continue to paint :((      We shall see.  Things at work are back to being nice and busy, which is okay with me.\nSo, hoping that all is well out there.....drop me a line now and then and let me know how you are!\nHugs.....Sue\n\n**\ndworkin\n**\nTo: sauron\nSubj: Hmmm..

Well, it's got another interesting little bug.\nIt seems that Sheankala (/players/wilbie/graveyard/monsters/goddess.c) is\ndoing a whole bunch of the spells in one round, instead of one like she's\nsuposed to do.  And every once in a while, she'll give the player fighting\nher an \"Argument Too Long\" error.\n\nThis only happens from time to time.  She fights normally every time I've\ntried her, and the only time I've personally seen the error was from a log\ncaptured by a player.\n\nIt has only happened (as far as I know) with goddess.c\n\nAlso, it has only started very recently, and I have made no changes to her.\n\nI'm at a loss as far as what's going wrong.  Has anything in the lib changed\nthat might cause this?\n\nIf you could take a look and let me know, that would be greatly appreciated.\n\n**\nhakan\n**\nTo: sauron\nSubj: for today only 6/25\nDate: Jun 25\n\nHiya Dave....\nThis message is effective only on Thursday June 25....\nH AHAPPY BIRTHDYA!!!!!!!!\nOoops....how about spelling it right??  \n\nHappy Birthday!!!!!!!!\nHope to talk to you soon....sne d an email (god, it's so hot here that I can't even type straight!!!)\nSue\nsskidmore@monmouth.com\n\n**\nten\n**\nTo: sauron\nSubj: need code \nDate: Jun 28\n\ndo you happen to know where i could download source the source \ncode for lp mud so i could make my own mud?\nmail me the address if you know where to find it please\nthanks \njason\n\n**\nakira\n**\nTo: sauron\nSubj: wheel of time\nDate: Jul  5\n\nJust finished the first book and into the great hunt.

If you agree to be his mentor\nthen you will set the mentor quest to him. this tells the\narches that you are prepared to stand behind him and push\nhim over the cli...err push him in the right direction.\n\nBefore you set the mentor quest, review his qualifictions\nas far as wizzing goes. Does he have the percentage to wiz?\nDoes he have the XP needed? Is he old enough?\n\nThen he will have ot ask the aches for permission to wiz.\nWe will set the ask_god quest to him and then he will\nbe able to go to his guild and advance wiz.\n\nThat about sum it up?\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Smorlok\nCc: sauron, haplo, airborne\nDate: Sep 12\n\nHe's got the age, and at Legend 20 I think he's got the experience.  Most \nimportantly (to me anyway) he seems like he wants to code some cool areas\nand help out the mud.  So I did the mentor thing.\n\nHe's coded on HM2 (don't hold that against him - a lot of us did) and he says\nhe has coded on others as well.  I am planning to be here quite a bit more,\nunless things at work get really screwed - we're replacing a mainframe\nwith an SAP/WinNT network and it's deadlined at November 2nd :)\n\nAnyway, I will help him as much as a I can, and HM has always been easy to \nget a handle on.

I think that we should \ndo whatever we can to me the mud more challenging for players, and \nthat the abundance of healing definately has something to do with \nthat. 40-60 gold per HP for a carried is not unreasonable, however\nwe need to look at how that balances with guild regenerative abilities\nas well.  Once we limit the availability of portable healing, suddenly\nany guild that offers healing is considerably more potent.  I think if \nwe do things like this that we should perhaps balance meditation skills\nwith something like 'can only meditate in a temple'... with that being \njust one example.\n\nW.\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: sauron\nSubj: healing...\nCc: arches\nDate: Nov  1\n\nSorry about that, zigged when I should have zagged.\n\nHere's the idea that I have been bouncing about in my head.  \n\nOk, suppose we limit meditation/healing skills to only the guild room\nand \"shrines\".  Then we give guild members the ability to create \nshrines in various locations.  Players will be able to have their \nhealing, but they would have to work a bit for it.  \n\nTo start, we'd have the shrine needed to be built.  An easy way to\nget players to spend a bunch of gold on all sorts of things, bowls, \nstatues, insense, etc.  Then they would have to protect those locations\nonce they were built.  Certainly leaving lots of valuables laying \naround would tempt almost any player, which would kinda be the point.\nAdd in the idea that some elements of theshrine would degrade with\ntime (insence comes to mind) and have to be replaced every so \noften.  \n\nThe idea is to create an economy by finding reasons for players to gather\nor purchase things that aren't just for killing.  If insence were only\navailable in a small handful of locations, and there was a demand for it\nwe'd create the demand.  It helps control healing rates, keeps money\ndown a bit, adds a roleplaying element to the mud, and encourages guilds\nto work together.\n\nIdeas and critics?\n\n\n**\neponine\n**\nTo: sauron\nSubj: hey\nDate: Nov  5\n\nhow do you remove an engagement ring around here?\n\n-catherine\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: ideas\nCc: airborne, sauron\nDate: Nov  6\n\n\nMy ideas, or shit that i just am not current on.\n\nI went throught the wizards directory and fingered every wiz.\n1/10 shows more than bi monthly log in\n50% are gone, no biggy\n90% appear to have done nothing new\n\nThe GM's are lacking in ability, missing, or just changing values set by the people\nwho coded them EONS ago.\n\nApollo is gone, still Barb GM\nNylakoorub is vag GM?\nWarlord, ninja GM, missing in action, read ninja board.\n\nokay, so those aren't ideas.\nI am sure you are aware of it, and have taken so kind of action, or at least made\na plan\n\nIdeas.\n\n1. You need working GUILDS,  The summoners were removed.  They work fine\nregardless of what anyone said about machine load.  They were not a problem with\n60 players, how are they a problem with 3\nIt would be a good and quick patch to the games variety to put them back into play.\n\n2.  I am working on a newspaper, and recruiting players to write for it.\n  In addition to the newspaper, They will write for separate book to be a Hitchikers\nGuide to Holy Mission type book to be sold somewhere in town, where the paper will be sold.\n\n3.  Would like to code a standard clan object, for groups like nethed to chat privatly,\n  each clan to be sponsered by a wizard, approved by arch or elder, and give some additional\n  feelings, possibly pose.\n\n4.  CONSIDER THIS ONE, Almost no Lpmud allow multi logins because of it taking\n   away access from other players,  This is a problem with 60+ logins, however\n   allowing the creative mudders of the internet the chance to use their zmud clients\n   to the best of their ability in running two characters from different guilds would\n  be a unique way to attract new players, and allow OTHER classes than mage to get used.\n\n   \n5.  Need the wizards to be nice,  Exos is a dick to everyone,  Can't believe i was\ngone for 3 years, and he rants on and on year after year with sage rank in place,\n I mean, i am not here to bitch and complain, just to make HM better, i have to speak up about it, He went off on thumper for no reason, hurt the poor girls feelings, \npeople don't come here to get insulted by rednecks\nsorry for the flame.\n\n6. Make wilbie a sage, no one has been promoted up the chain in a long time from\nwhat i see in the logs\n\n7. thats all the ideas for now.\n\n8.
