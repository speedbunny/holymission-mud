The address of it is http://www.tcnj.edu/~skidmore/babes.html\nCjeck it out and let me know if it is too big.  I'll set the permissions for you \nwhen I hear from you.\nPete\np.s thanks again\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: waldo\nSubj: Some ideas, had to mail you them\n\nCc: saffrin\nDate: Jan  2\n\nWatching Talyx play Warcraft today I got some mage spells\nideas..hehe....silly huh, I knwo but here they are:\n\n1. sheep - yes, sheep!  in honor of silas of course ;)\n     -with this spell a mage can temperarily curse a player to \nbecome a sheep thus reducing their damage.  It will wear off\nas other spells do.  \n\n2. unsheep - see sheep ;)  \n    - another mage can rescue a victim of sheep by casting\nunsheep on them.\n\n3.  distant fire - with this spell a mage can blast a monster with \nfire through another player's eyes.  This is a high level spell and\nhas a very bad chance of working, but when it does it hits hard.\n\n4.  whirlwind - an offensive spell that is similar to fireball that\ncauses high damage with the winds.\n\n5. curse/uncurse - any annoying spell for the mischievous mage\nto cast on anyone harassing them (exmaples: bard's sletzer\nthieves mud)  Although it causes no damage it is rather annoying\nand spammy.  This will make the victim babble and look crazy \nto the room they are in.  Uncurse is to lift it.\n\n6. slow - to reduce the hits per round by a given monster.  should\nbe limited to a certain number of rounds.  (example: level/4 rounds)\n\n7. bloodlust - makes the monsters in the room attack each other\n\n8. mana drain - after the monster is dead a mage can mana drain corpse\nto heal slightly.  The heal should be in ratio to the leve\nmonster.  *this has been requested by mages*\n\n9. mage tell - gotta come up with one soon, have any ideas, want\nto have something orginal, too many damn birds flying around with\ntells for people *grin*  Something like a firefly or a kelpie or\nsomething, firefly is cute :)\n\nDamn, I had a few more ideas I cant remember, them, will mail\nmore when they come to me.\n\nSaff\n\nPS say hi to shell for me and tell her that her card rocked!!!\n\n**\nanastasia\n**\nTo: waldo\nSubj: perl programming\n\nCc: .\nDate: Apr 14\n\nWell, my fiance does some perl programming...\nhe's at work right now (for an ISP)..if you want to..you can e-mail him\nat pkomkai?mosquitonet.com (and tell him I said you could. :))\nsend him the file, possibly and he'll do what he can. :)\nHope it helps..\nGlyn (Anastasia)\n(My fiance's name is Pavat..his character on here is Westley)\n\n**\nlinsolent\n**\nTo: waldo\nSubj: Hi\nDate: Jan 13\n\nHi dude.

I have layed out many reasons why i want to be arch\nand i am consistantly put off and ignored.  The arches want to do everything behind \nclosed doors.  I am sending this letter to Mangla, who of all the arches, is the\nonly one that codes, and has been here, and who has admittedly pointed out that\nhe forgets things, and misses things, because of everything that needs done.\n\nCoding for HM is something that I enjoy to the fullest, but it has not been fun.\nAt every turn I have an archwizard speaking down at me, lying about me or at\nleast continuing an untrue rumor to others, THIS IS LOGGED, I have sent it to \nmangla.  We have archwizards who last coded 5 years ago.  We have archwizards\nwith outside commitments that take up space here.  We have archwizards that\ntake off 5 months and turn up like messiahs reasserting their rightful positions\nand casting down judgements. And we have one coding arch.\n\nFor 3 and one half years I watched the mud go through death throws, as players\nand wizards were driven off by shitty policies, guild closings, and the mud\nbeing moved around( all reasons I have heard).  Sauron, of the beloved\nninja guild had 3.5 years to recode ninja, he also had 3.5 years to\nput the monk into a bin system, and do something to balance it.  It just wasn't\ndone.  I do not know what he has done, but i can only speak of what wasn't done,\nand ask if opening and fixing these guilds was less important that what was done.\n\nThere was plenty of time for these people to \"shit or get off the pot\".\nIt wasn't done.  For those of you who do not know, or who have prescribed to\nthe rumors that abound.  I was banned by mistake.  I was kept away and put\noff without reason.  Untrustworty was heard. All sorts of things.\nFor the brief time i was unbanned, i was NEVER returned to my position,\nalthough it was a mistake that i lost it.  I was kept and treated as\na wiz with suspicion, and comments being made about me.  It sucked.\n\nI was restored to my position.  Airborne said it was a check on Mangla.\nMangla said it was to bring back HM.  Silas voted for me cause i asked him.\nIn the time that i made elder, I restored the ninja with wilbie, tinman,\nand bobo, restored the summoners with redsexy.  recruited and set up\n7 new Gm's, reviewed and opened 5 areas, coded a clan system, and fixed\n2 whole areas.  There is much more that needs done.  And i log on every\nday to find some social archwizard speaking down from above.  Or active\nones talking down about me or to me.  Telling me what is wrong with me, \nand refusing to listen to all the facts established about what is wrong\nwith what they have done.  I have done archwizard work.  I was an archwizard.\nI have used elder position to help everyone on here, even the assholes.\n\nMany other wizards have been inspired to come back, but that momentum is dying.\nThey have been put off, forgotten, while the ALL important archwizards\nsit back for a month to discuss things.  Redsexy was ignored for a year.\nHer area forgotten.  Bobo has done more coding than any other person\nat his rank, he is ignored and put off.  I don't blame him for cutting back.\nThere are wizards that are banished and wanted to come back, but they are\nignored.  And Exos is still here even after the testimony of 7 or 8 people\nattested to his absolute wrongdoings.\n\nAfter the ninja guild was restored, players and wizards started calling for\nnew archwizards with my name being mentioned many times.  These people were\ntold point blank to shut the hell up.  I have no conception of what\nyou arches have going on in that little room, and what bullshit ideas are\nfloating around.  But face it. One coding arch, isn't going to cut it.\nThe mud blew up in sargons workroom, understandings were reached, Then ignored.\nThat Tuesday came and went a month ago.  The old ways are no longer needed.\nWho is gonna help you put in the 100 level system? Airborne? Silas?\nKryll?, maybe Warlord and Uglymoth.  Maybe Sauron when he comes back from\nhis next extended vacation.  Hello, Tatsuo has the ability, and has shown it.\nThe mantras of me being some evil son of a bitch won't work forever when\nthey are demonstrably untrue.  You know what Redsexy is right, I am BOTH.\n\nI cannot fathom the resistance to the move when everything points to a positive.\nWhen there is a chance to remove the dead weight and move up the people\nthat are bringing back the players.  The momentum as you put it is starting to slip\nwith the players.  I can spark it back up.  I will claim responsibility\nfor a large percent of the comeback that is started.  I give the rest to the\npeople who have been ignored and put off.  From what i know, there are\npotentially 3 mudlib level coders on the game besides you Mangla.\nThose are your archwizards.\nTatsuo, Wilbie, and Sargon.\n\nPlease stop bogarting the highest position in the game when others can fill \nthose positions.  calling kryll to login hasn't made him come back and fix the\nplace. and saurons instant appearance also has done little but piss me off.\nPut the level where the level belongs.  With the people that code this place,\nand enjoy it.\n\nYou want the 100 level system in, arch those people.\nYou want the guilds running and balanced, arch those people.\nYou want players coming back, arch those people.\nYou want new players, arch those people.\nYou want wizards coding and being helped with code, arch those people.\nYou want Holy Mission back, arch those people.\n\nIf you want things the way they were. Sit back and dicuss things some more with\nthe deadbeats that brought her down.\nMake some changes, shake the boat. Take action, make it fun.\nIf not, I am outta here.  \n\nI have forwarded this to every wiz that gives a damn, and i will ask that\nthese wizzes write their feelings to MANGLA and cc it to TATSUO.  I want\na clean and open debate.  I also ask that it not be sent to other arches\nwhose feelings may be hurt by it.  That is not my intention.  I i have\nspoken an untruth, let it be known.  If i am right, tell mangla to fix the\nplace.\n\nTatsuo, for Holy Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: redsexy\nFwd:  mail\nCc: bobo, uruz, waldo, wilbie, tinman, thumper\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: mail\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nI recently reseved a letter that had some stronge statements made in it.\nOdds are you know the one I am talking about. We stand at a cross roads,\nit is no secret that this mud is dead, but there is hope. Recently the old\ncoders have returned, and with them some new players. This mud can be\ngreat once again. \"These are the time that try mens souls\" Henry V. I\nsay that because people don't seem to like change, it seems to try there\nsouls. Well its time to put the games aside and start to do what is best\nfor the mud. Tatsuo has shown that he can get things done. Why then do\nwe not let him do this. The answer would seem to be with the arches. I have\nno clue what you guys do, but I see what you don't do, and this is help\nthis place. We need new arches and new changes to be made. I FULLY suport\nthe ideas set forth by Tatsuo and some of the others wizes. Given this\nI stand with them and or walk with them, please let it be the former than\nthe latter.\n                                       Akira\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: redsexy\nFwd:  Tatsuo / Archwiz\nCc: sargon, akira, uruz, waldo, wilbie, bobo, tinman, widge, icehouse, ati\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo / Archwiz\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nWell I'm only a beginner, and actually this is the 1st MUD i've ever been on. And I may not know much about what all the details are, but I can say that Tatsuo is someone on here who I could immediately tell that he knew what he was doing.\nWhen there was a bug, Tatsuo fixes it. When we bump into each other, he converses with me. I constantly see him on here and he has never EVER said anything like \"Well hold on. I'm busy.\"\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding. But once I met people like Tatsuo and Redsexy who were this friendly, I haven't even tried one of the other 500 muds on this list of mine. That should show how attractive this place is. And if all the other Archwizzes made it what it is today, I'm sure those two can help make it what it will be tomorrow.\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding.
