About 2 to 3 years ago. \nI was once a memeber and my name was Talon back then.\nI see that this guild is no more :(. I was curious what ever happend to the guild\n \nIf possible, I'd like to see any of the old abilities that the guild had. I wanted\nto port the guild over to a D&D campaign. I would be most gratefull of any information that\nyou might still have on the guild. I do remember you where the original coder of that guild.\n \nThanks, Ddennis@demarco.com\n\n\n**\n"
