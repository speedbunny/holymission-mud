I wanted to make this request of all \nof you.  I am sorry if i could not included everyone as I brought up\nmost of your names from memory.\n      I was removed banished because Herp was told on the wizline \nby Leslie that It was me who had altered his prison file.\nLeslie said this because i was mentioning the abuse of the\nprison file earlier that day.  I have made almost no attempt\nto reinstate my self in the last few months but I am coming\nto the point where I really miss being here and talking with most\nof you.  When I was here I made a difference.  I want to do so again\nMy life has settled down and I am no longer in transition.  I hold\nthe postion of General Manager and Partner of Hawk Manufactured Housing\nbased in Warren PA and have recently opened the 5th Sanchin Karate Academy \nthere.  But anyway.\nI have sent mail to Herp explaning everything that transpired and trying\nto clear up the whole mess.  I need support.\nI would like to ask each and every one of you to mail a short message\nto Herp.  Say what you can.  If only that you believe what happened \nwas a mistake and you would like to see Tatsuo unbanished.\nI am counting on each one of you.  I hthink I have helped each one \nof you over the years and I REALLY WANT TO COME BACK.\nplease drop me a mail if you sent something so i can keep track.\nThank You,\n         David Grant Goodman, AKA Tatsuo\n           814-226-7228\n\n**\nsaffrin\n**\nTo: darastor\n Fw:   I dont like this MUD anymore, respect is gone\nCc: beardy\nDate: Mar 26\n\nTo: sauron\nSubj: I dont like this MUD anymore, respect is gone\n\nCc: saffrin\nDate: Mar 26\n\nDave,\n\nThis letter is of a serious nature.  I have reached my final straw here on\nHM.  Everytime I turn around one arch or another is critiszing me.\nNot you of course, you seem to be only of the only people arches around \nhere.  Haplo too, when I can catch him to talk to him.  Between Mangla,\nAirborne, and of course, Kryll (who acts like an arch anyways) I have been\nharassed about my codes, had my codes changed without my permission, and\nsuch.  I reached my final straw when today, Airborne nit picked at Hamlet\narea again.  I recoded that damn area 3 times already becaause Mangla\ndidnt like its set up and such.  Like I posted in the past, who do I\nbelieve?  Mangla says to fix one thing, then Airborne comes in and say that\nisnt it, fix it this way.  With all this crap, I have been harassed and\nabused.  Figleaf and I are supposed to be player law on here.\nYet, when someone comes to us with a real complaint, Mangla and Airborne\nseem to take a personal intrest and if they dont like or like someone,\nthey judge it according to that.  I will not sit around for this abuse\nmuch longer.  I am at the end of my rope.  Sometimes I feel they have\ndeliberatly singled me out as their target because I see no one else on\nhere receive the abuse and harassment I have.  Players ask for hlep\nwith some problem that is bothering them, being PK'd or harassed and\nFigleaf and I are helpless to react to these things because if we do,\nwe get yelled at by Mangla or Airborne and even Kryll.  Where is the HM\nthat used to be unit?  Is it so far gone that most wizards feel like\nvictims in an arch power war?  Thwe power war of mangla and airborne?  \nI trust very few people here anymore because of the treatment I received.\nI work my butt off for here and for what.....to get critisixed at every\nturn.  Hell, I looked around for codes that use all I have been told to\nchange and only about 10% use them and most are not arch areas...is it,\ndo as I say, not as I do?  If a standard is going to be held to me and\nno one else, tell me why I should follow it?  At thsi point, the only\nenjoyable time I find on this MUD is when playing because I tend to be\nignored by them.  Except when my player was threatened by a Legend level\nplayer because of who her mud husband is.  Then I get told, big deal, since\ntaht log was made of it, I have advance far and maxed out my stats at level\n14.  If I die, by the hands of a legend levle player....do I get anything?\n\nIf they would come forward, there are more wizards that feel this way but\nare too afraid they will be banished or ignored simply because mangla\nkyrll and airborne dont like them or wont like them anymore\nfor finding fault in them.   When my areas are set, I plan at leaving HM\nunless things around here change by then.  I need a sabatical from the\nharassment I get on here from people who I once respected and were\nfriends with.  \n\nYou will always have my respect.  I just feel I have been singled out by\nthem to take abuse and I do not like it one bit.  No one else here has\nbeen harassed and critiized like I have by those 3.  Haplo once said\nif I felt I was being treated badly to speak up.  Well, I did and only\ngot shit for it.  This place has lost its sparkle and its unity.  I\ndont know if it can ever get it back.  I only know that coding for here\nonce made me happy, now all it is is hell.\n\nSorry,\nCindi\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: beardy\nSubj: Accepted dummy\nDate: Oct  4\n\nThe accepted dummy would be in /players/dice/obj/dummy.c\nClone this one and you whould have no problems.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\n"
