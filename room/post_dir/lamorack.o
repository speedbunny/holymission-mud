Still, maybe in a couple of months. I won't\nbe forgetting about this place altogether, just don't want to\ndo what certain GMs do (and I DON'T mean WEarlord here,\njust in case that sounds like a bitch, you should probably look\nat the vagabonds or the barbarians for egs of what I mean)\nand go idle for months ata time, but still expect to be a big player at the end of it all\n\nI'd rather be honest when I'm short of time to code\n\nD\n\n**\nguenhywyven\n**\nTo: lamorack\nSubj: hey babe\nDate: May  9\n\nguess what?\nI have my own personal eamil account.  It's cll@6804.ksu.edu\nCatch ya Later.\nLove corey\n\n**\ngriffon\n**\nTo: lamorack\nRe:   hello\nDate: Jun 12\n\nHeya!! Not so well.. I'm at a stand still on both a\nsummer job and a perm. job.. so I'm just waiting to \nsee what the fates will deal to me!\n\n**\ngriffon\n**\nTo: lamorack\nRe:   heya\nDate: Jun 16\n\nAwwww.. how sweet!! thanks.. Though I wouldnt be able to \nsay if I do or dont look better then Kate Winslet, since I \nreally dont find myself attractive, cuse only concieted \npeople do find themselves overly attractive ,). \n\nAs for jobs, still looking in NJ and MD. Theres no where to \nreally broaden the search out to. Not many places are highering \nright now. Thats the problem with every job though I suppose.\n\nLaters! Rin\n\nP.S. Thanks for the compliment! :)\n\n\n**\nguenhywyven\n**\nTo: lamorack\nSubj: you\nDate: Sep  6\n\nim falling in love with you........but im not perfect..i hope i dont disapoint you when you see me in october....your the only one i think about...monday seems forever away....waiting for your phonecall......I love you....Corinsa....*guenhywyven**\n\n**\nguenhywyven\n**\nTo: lamorack\nSubj: hut\nDate: Sep  6\n\nchanged my matchmaker form...check it out..\n*&*\n\n**\n"
