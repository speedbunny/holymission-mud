If you can get your hands on it, I'll take a look.\n\nDave\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: danford\nSubj: nase ftp\nDate: Apr 14\n\nSorry about the last mail.. didn't mean to be quite so blunt. :)\n\nI have a problem with nase ftp... I get a couple of errors when I try to\ncompile it. Namely:\n\nftpd.c: In function `main':\nftpd.c:805: `FAPPEND' undeclared (first use this function)\nftpd.c:805: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once\nftpd.c:805: for each function it appears in.)\nftpd.c: In function `statcmd':\nftpd.c:1747: `bytesize' undeclared (first use this function)\nftpd.c: In function `send_file_list':\nftpd.c:2454: structure has no member named `d_namlen'\nftpd.c:2457: structure has no member named `d_namlen'\n\nThere are a bunch of warnings as well, but I've learnt from driver compilation\nto ignore them. :)\n\nI remember having a 'd_namlen' problem with part of the driver that Herp\nwrote, and I fixed it by using 'd_reclen\" I think, but that\nefun doesn't work properly on my machine.\n\nAny clues?\n\nDave\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: danford\nSubj: nase ftp\nDate: Apr 14\n\nWell, I fixed the d_namlen error properly by using\n'strlen(d->d_name)' instead of 'd->d_namlen'.\n\nWhen I say 'fixed', the error doesn't show up when I try to compile. :)\nStill not sure about the other two... one may just be a missing var, but the\none in caps looks like a missing def to me and I have no idea what it should\nbe.\n\nDaev\nack Dave even :)\n\n**\nmontoya\n**\nTo: danford\nSubj: Contact Email Address\nCc: Demolian, Sauron, Daniella, Darastor, Jewel\nDate: Apr 26\n\nYo guys and girls... this post is going to a few of you\nsome of whom I've run into, others I've missed, so I hope it's\nthe same people using the name as I remember. If not, sorry to \nbother you.\n\nAnyway, Your friendly neighbourhood Spaniard is back\nalthough how often I'm not sure, but I have a contact email\naddress which you can use, but please bear in mind that it\nis a sub-account on someone elses Connection so I won't be\nable to check it and reply too often, but I'll do my best ok.\n\nIts.... (wait for it....) montoya@lineone.net\n\nHeheheh !!\n\nAnd to those of you getting this that I haven't managed to\nspeak to in person yet... HI !!!!! *HUGS*\n\nInigo.   aka Owen.\n\n**\ntexas\n**\nTo: danford\nSubj: stuff\nDate: Apr 27\n\nlooks like i have a couple. Will mail them to you asap (prob 1 or 2 days)\n\nTex\n\n**\nwilbie\n**\nTo: danford\nSubj: blade\nCc: sauron\nDate: May  6\n\nThat's possible.  Try cloning the file gs.c instead of goddess_sword.c\nIt's the same thing but it actually shows you the amount of healing that\nyou recieve.  Sort of a debug mode.\n\nIf indeed the sword is healing more now, there are three ways that I can\nsee to fix it.  One is to make the sword destruct or become \"non-healing\"\nafter so many heals.  I don't like this idea much.  Two is to lower the\nmaximum heal amount (my personal favorite) to half of what it was originally.\nA third option is to cut the chance of the heal in half.\n\nAnd don't hesitate to let me know if there are problems...  I welcome your\ninput :)  Someday soon I'll have the time to fix all this stuff.\n\nDomo-arigato (thanks)\nWilbie\n\n**\nroxanne\n**\nTo: danford\nSubj: Barely caught you....\nDate: May  6\n\nMan...I missed you by about 5 minutes.  Sucky....oh well.\nI was gabbing with Rebecca when we got booted and didn't realize we talked for so long.\nI'll grab you tomorrow or something.\n\nLater love,\nMe\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: danford\nRe:   not around\nDate: May 14\n\nNo worries...
