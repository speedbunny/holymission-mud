I'll try to get to it as soon as possible. I ought to\nwarn you though that I'm a killer on detail and presentation, especially  \nstrict typing and formatting of the code.\n\nI haven't sent you anything from the mud as yet because I'm planning some\nrather radical changes to the inheritable code, and so it would all be out\nof date soon anyway. I'm not sure exactly what to send you anyway... I    \ndoubt you want copies of all the /rooms/ areas, and there are only about a\ndozen useful inheriable files around.\n\nBtw, is Dworkin around? He hasn't logged onto HM in a while and I would   \nlike to know whether he's continuing with his work on the /std/ stuff...  \nIt's no biggie if he's not going to be around - I'll get to it myself\nsooner or later, but it would be nice to have a hand once in a while. ;)\nIf I don't see you before the break, have a good holiday. Let me know if  \nyou want me to get your area looked at before you go away... I have rather\nalot on my plate right now, what with being the only active arch and all. ;)\n   \nTTYL\nDave/Sauron\n\n**\ndanford\n**\nTo: texas\nRe:   stuff\nDate: May  6\n\nI done wizzed :)\n\nWoo hoo!\n\nThx for your help dude\n\n-Eric\n\n**\n"
