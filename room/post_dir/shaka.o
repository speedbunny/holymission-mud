I looked through you directory \nand it appears you have coded alot of files. I did not alter any of them nor did i demote you as it appears\nyou have been working on something. Please let me know if you plan to return \nor if your schedule at this time is to busy. If you could let us know\nwe can better arrange to keep your dir and prevent any accidently loss of yor\nfiles. thanks for your time. I sent this also to shadowmonk as he thinks he\ncan get ahold of you.\n\n  Thank you\n    Haplo\n\n**\ncaldric\n**\nTo: shaka\nSubj: ha die shaka\nCc: caldric\nDate: Oct 13\n\nHe man,\nHe man,\nHoe gaat het met je?
