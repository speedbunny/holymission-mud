You can  \nemail me at dave_m_walter@geocities.com if you would rather send an email\nas opposed to a mudmail. I will post a general note on the wizard board   \nwhen I am closer to getting this project off the ground, but as you seemed\nto have ideas about it, I thought I'd ask you now.\n\nI'll look forward to hearing from you soon.\nSauron\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: james\nSubj: any word if Herp got the computer i sent him?\nDate: Feb 16\n\nI received an email from him the other day - he has received the machine but\nis having trouble getting it to boot. You might want to drop him a line to\nsee if he could use a hand.\n\nSauron\n\n**\n"
