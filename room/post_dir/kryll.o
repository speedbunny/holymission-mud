I think that we should \ndo whatever we can to me the mud more challenging for players, and \nthat the abundance of healing definately has something to do with \nthat. 40-60 gold per HP for a carried is not unreasonable, however\nwe need to look at how that balances with guild regenerative abilities\nas well.  Once we limit the availability of portable healing, suddenly\nany guild that offers healing is considerably more potent.  I think if \nwe do things like this that we should perhaps balance meditation skills\nwith something like 'can only meditate in a temple'... with that being \njust one example.\n\nW.\n\n**\nredsexy\n**\nTo: kryll\nSubj: Cantina Reports\nDate: Oct 29\n\nOK everything has been changed apart from three things...\n\n1)  WC of Snips.  They're meant to be like kickass mosquitos,\n  capable of killing people quickly but dead easy to kill\n  I'll change that if u like.\n\n2)  Only finding one jar.  I hate it when people can just keep\n   on finding stuff by searching over and over. There\n   is no need for anyone to be walking around with more\n  than one jar, so I set it to just the one.\n\n3)  Variable experience on table.  I'll wait til you've\n   looked into it, but the idea of winning experience\n  from gambling is already in the game... see Wilbie's\n   Wheel of Fortune.  I think the odds are pretty\n   even for winning and loosing....\n\nI've done a bit of the desert, but I'll do most of that\ntomorrow.  I'll also need u to help me figure why d5\ndoesn't load 1st try....\n\nThanks, and see ya soon,\n=\nRed\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: airborne\nRe:   healing\nCc: arches\nDate: Oct 31\n\nI don't know that we should remove all meditation outside of a 'temple' but\nmaybe we could reduce the healing rate outside of that player's guild rooms.\nSeems to me that being in their temple, or at their shrine, or whatever,\nshould heal them faster, or conversely, being away from there should heal\nthem slower (since we want to reduce the healing, not increase it).\n\nDave\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: kryll\nFwd:  healing\nCc: arches\nDate: Nov  1\n\nTo: airborne\nRe:   healing\nCc: arches\nDate: Oct 31\n\nI don't know that we should remove all meditation outside of a 'temple' but\nmaybe we could reduce the healing rate outside of that player's guild rooms.\nSeems to me that being in their temple, or at their shrine, or whatever,\nshould heal them faster, or conversely, being away from there should heal\nthem slower (since we want to reduce the healing, not increase it).\n\nDave\n\n**\nairborne\n**\nTo: kryll\nSubj: healing...\nCc: arches\nDate: Nov  1\n\nSorry about that, zigged when I should have zagged.\n\nHere's the idea that I have been bouncing about in my head.  \n\nOk, suppose we limit meditation/healing skills to only the guild room\nand \"shrines\".  Then we give guild members the ability to create \nshrines in various locations.  Players will be able to have their \nhealing, but they would have to work a bit for it.  \n\nTo start, we'd have the shrine needed to be built.  An easy way to\nget players to spend a bunch of gold on all sorts of things, bowls, \nstatues, insense, etc.  Then they would have to protect those locations\nonce they were built.  Certainly leaving lots of valuables laying \naround would tempt almost any player, which would kinda be the point.\nAdd in the idea that some elements of theshrine would degrade with\ntime (insence comes to mind) and have to be replaced every so \noften.  \n\nThe idea is to create an economy by finding reasons for players to gather\nor purchase things that aren't just for killing.  If insence were only\navailable in a small handful of locations, and there was a demand for it\nwe'd create the demand.  It helps control healing rates, keeps money\ndown a bit, adds a roleplaying element to the mud, and encourages guilds\nto work together.\n\nIdeas and critics?\n\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nSubj: arena\nCc: exos, arches\nDate: Mar 19\n\nI had another though. If we get enough people. I would not\nmind seeing two arena a day when it makes sense. But the\nsecond arena would be open for lower levels. So be careful\nwhen opening the arenas, and if there are more lower levels\non then exclude the higher levels, or have two.\n\nthe syntax, in case you had/have problems is:\nopen arena <min>-<max>\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: thumper\nSubj: Exos\nCc: arches\nDate: Mar 22\n\nI have a set of complaints, and we are watching to catch\nhim in the act. So far the only act was have caught him in\nis talking to kitty. Nothing threatening. If he is guilty,\nthen he will slip up. At that time, caught red-handed,\nwe will do it. Have some patience. It will be addressed.\n\nAs for Tatsuo. That will be taken care of in its own\ntime also. There are many many facts that have been\nleft out. There are no insecurity issues.\n\n-Mangla\narches\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: sargon\nSubj: Promotions\nCc: arches, tinman, shadowmonk, brainsprain, redsexy, bobo, turbo\nDate: Mar 31\n\nAs was promised, the promotions have been made.\nThanks for your time and patience.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: turbo\nSubj: bard skill\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr  8\n\n     One of the bard skills somehow allows a bard to sidestep a backstab.\nThis does not make snese to me, how can you sidestep an attack that\nyou do not know is coming, it is not even like the bard guild is a guild who \nis incredibly dextrious.  If there is a valid skill reason for this, I\nwould like to know, otherwise it should be changed, thieves are meant\nto rely on this one skill, backstab, for most of their damage and it is\na onetime only attack, if it is going to be blocked by your guild\nI need to decide what that means towards my guilds skills\n\nBrainsprain\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: brainsprain\nRe:   bard skill\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr  8\n\nskill?  I can think of a spell, irish luck, but a skill?\nIrish luck has a LONG recast time, and from my understanding of it\ngives AT BEST 15 dodges.  While this may seem like a lot,\n\nkeep in mind that the shadow lasts longer than 9000 seconds, \nwhich is the MAX time for their Armour of ithan.\n\nAlso, how did this come to be known?\nWhy was a thief backstabbing a bard to begin with.\nOh, and as far as not know its comming, that is why its called\nIrish Luck.  Luck can account for a lot of things, including \navoiding an attack you do not see coming.  While the message this dodge\nreturns may not be descriptive of the attack,\nthat does not disqualify it.\nAfter all, as a player, I have pounded skeletons into a pile of blood\nand body parts many times.\n\nThe message may be innaccurate, but the effect is the same.\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: turbo\nSubj: in reply to both\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr  8\n\nYeah, arches will mail all of the arches, i think wizzes works as well\nto send to everybody.\n\nAs to to skill or spell, that is fine, what happened was malice and treat\nwere in the arena and I was watching the battle over malices shoulder.\nI watched treat sidestep a backstab, which made no sense whatsoever to me.  When i asked him how he did it\nhe refused to cooperate, so i asked him if it was a skill, and if it was\nthat it would suffice, he told me it was a skill, so i asked him what \nthat skill was, he wouldn't tell me (telling me, of course, would have\ns\nsettled this without you and I even having to discuss it, I think this is,\nbtw, a very valid skill.  \n\nThanks for the info, i wont be coding around the spell, i think it is very valid,\nbut I do have one question: What level does a bard have to be\nin order to get that skill and does it take the attackers level\ninto account, I think it should, that way lvl 22 bards arent dodging attacks\nfrom L10 thieves (just an example).  \n\nThanks turbo\n\nThe sprain\n\n**\nbrainsprain\n**\nTo: kryll\nSubj: First goldsun area\nCc: arches\nDate: Apr 14\n\nI have revised the first of goldsun's area .. the poorly named\n7-islands (since there are only 6)  However, I have my own\narea, a huge island, that i am going to rebuild into the \n7th island.  That aside, I would like to get the area put\ninto play as soon as possible, it is in:\n/players/brainsprain/goldsun/7-islands/\n\n\n**\n"
