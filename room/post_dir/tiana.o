Not too much here in Seattle.  Things here are treating me pretty well at the moment.  I really like it here and now I have finally met a few people who are my own age that work for my company.  There is this one girl named Lisa.\nShe is really kewl and me and her have been hanging out lately.  I think that you and her would get along really well.  It would be nice to see you if you could make it out here after graduation.  Good luck with that and STOP partying so much...you\nare making me JEALOUS!  \n Well, I just thought that I would write to you to say hello.  I will be around this weekend so maybe I will give you a call at home.  Let me know what your phone number at home is and if there is a good time to call you.  I miss you schweetie and want to\nsee you soon.  Take care and stay out of trouble.  I love you and miss you schweetie!!!!!!\n\nLove,\n Pete\n\n**\n"
