If it works well, we can set it up\nin /obj for all to use... I'd really love to set up an /inherit dir as well,\nbut I'm not sure how well that would work...\n\nDave\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: dworkin\nSubj: std book\n\nDate: Aug 20\n\nI dunno what you've done so far, but could you make the std book your first\npriority please? Seems Mangla is quite keen for all exsisting books (eg\nthe ules books in the sheriff's offices) to use a std book.\n\nThanx\nDave\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: dworkin\nSubj: Linux PPP script\nDate: Aug 29\n\nWell, the original PPP script is in /players/sauron/etc/dip.script...\nHowever, I did write an updated version for Demon, but that's on my\nLinux machine which is in transit...\n\nYou use the script with a cmd such as:\n\n/usr/sbin/dip -v /etc/dip.script 2>&1\n\nLet me know how it goes... if you still want the script when my machine\narrives I'll send it to you.\n\nDave\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: dworkin\nSubj: Dalmore\nDate: Sep 10\n\nNice mud... shame about the cmds/lib/driver/(need I go on?)... *cackle*\n\nLike I said, it's going to be a challenge, but it'll be fun. Not sure\nexactly how much time I'll have since I'm arch on 2 muds, creator on\na third (although I may quit there), and am thinking about a fourth\n(as well as Dalmore...) so I'm stretched. Plus there's RL to figure in\nsomewhere... as always.\n\nAnyway, I'll see how I go. Providing a job and alll that stuff doesn't\nget in the way, I'll help out if ya want me...\n\ndave\n\n**\nkryll\n**\nTo: dworkin\nSubj: objects\nDate: Sep 20\n\ni don't know if sauron told you, but we would like to have these\nstandards included with userdocs. i will change the std_object.c\nbut are you going to call everything std_*? seems a little redundant\nwhen it is in the std directory...just some thoughts...\nwhen it is in the std directory...just some thoughts...\nkryll\n\n**\nkryll\n**\nTo: dworkin\nSubj: userdocs\nDate: Sep 22\n\nwell, i had started with recodes and sauron wanted userdocs\nfor each function in the object, such as for query_name, etc.\ni'll move my base.c into the /std dir for you to look at and\nsee what i want/need the base object to contain\nof course, this is a base for all objs excluding rooms and\nlivings\n\nkryll\n\nps. thanks\n\n**\nsauron\n**\nTo: dworkin\nRe:   Unable to create sub-dirs in /std\nCc: kryll, mangla\nDate: Sep 24\n\nI dunno why you can't create subdirs - I can only assume that the rights\ncontrolled by the xperms don't extend to making/removing directories for\nsome odd reason.\n\nAs for the man pages, don't write a separate cmd for these files... Just\nwrite pages in the style of the current ones, and I'll move them to the\n/doc dir when I go over the code... This will be sometime after Monday as\nmy parents are visiting and so I'm not on much right now.\n\nDave\n\n**\nsteerpike\n**\nTo: dworkin\nSubj: greebo\nDate: Oct 17\n\nYeah, sure, I can take a look at it some time.\nIf you want to meet up in Dundee some time, btw, I think I'm going to be in\nDundee with nothing to do some time at the end of the first week in November.\nI should have a better idea when later on. Blah.\n--me\n\n**\nsteerpike\n**\nTo: dworkin\nRe:   Ey up! What's up?\nDate: May 31\n\nNothing too exciting is up.\n\nI just moved ... to another part of edinburgh, so all my\naddresses and stuff is different.\n\nIf you want to meet up in Edinburgh some time, give me a\ncall on 4671120 or email on ewright@ednet.co.uk -- or mail\nme another copy of your addresses which I lost. Doh.\n\n-Edward\n\n**\nparis\n**\nTo: dworkin\nSubj: .\nDate: Apr  6\n\nnot talking to me now ? *grin*\n\n**\n"
