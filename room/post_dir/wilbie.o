If you agree to be his mentor\nthen you will set the mentor quest to him. this tells the\narches that you are prepared to stand behind him and push\nhim over the cli...err push him in the right direction.\n\nBefore you set the mentor quest, review his qualifictions\nas far as wizzing goes. Does he have the percentage to wiz?\nDoes he have the XP needed? Is he old enough?\n\nThen he will have ot ask the aches for permission to wiz.\nWe will set the ask_god quest to him and then he will\nbe able to go to his guild and advance wiz.\n\nThat about sum it up?\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nsmorlok\n**\nTo: wilbie\nRe:   mentoring\nDate: Sep 12\n\nmy only problem is my quest rating, because there is something wrong with it.\ni asked mangla about wizzing and he told me i have to find a mentor and my\nq-rating will be more than 85% then i can get apprentice and after that\ni'm able to seek permission to wiz\nthat's the reason why i asked you to be my mentor before i'm appr.\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: reopen ezo and ishikawa\nCc: wilbie, airborne\nDate: Nov  3\n\n\nWilbie and I would like to reopen at least the areas of ezo and ishikawa, the area\ncoded by patience, that i recoded, and the area, haplo and I, (secret: I coded whole \nthing),  coded with the ishikawa quest.\n\npriorities for project.\n\n1. Get Ezo reopened save for the ninja guild halls, upgrade monsters, and equipment\n  to current standards.\n\n2. Reopen Ishikawa, reinstate quest, recode as necessary.\n\n3. Reopen Ninja guild, I believe i have the talent and experience necessary after\n   completion of first two steps to get it working.  Wilbie as well.\n\n4.  Recode and reopen of samurai guild. \n\n\nThese eastern areas were a HUGE attraction in during the old days, and wilbie and\nmyself remember enough of it, having been part, and coding extensivly with these areas.\n\nPlease approve the project, and give instructions for implementation of each part.\n\nTatsuo & Wilbie\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: tatsuo\nRe:   reopen ezo and ishikawa\nCc: wilbie, airborne\nDate: Nov  3\n\nI was under the impression that much of Ezo is open. If not then\nplease let me know about the sizes of the current open areas, and\nwhat sizes you would like to redo/add. the only thing I though\nt was closed was much of the ninja guild halls and maybe the\ncaves.\n\nIshikawa can be a new project. I was not very familiar with the\nold one so I am not sure how it was layed out. It would be nice\nto have some new area, as always. Get the above two things open,\nthen we can talk more about the quest. this does not mean you\ncannot code special things into rooms in preperation for the quest,\njust that I do not want to say yeah or nay to quest without\ndiscussing it first.\n\nNinja guild is Warlord. Talk to him.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: wilbie\nSubj: area\nDate: Nov  5\n\n\nOkay, since Ezo seems to be occupied, and the ninja guild is being run\nby someone that logs in once a decade, why not help me out with new mega area\nI will write up some maps\nto the pyrmid area i was coding, mail em to you, and we can do joint pyramid area\nI would rather code area here on HM, than on new realms.\nI have lost enthusiam for new realms since returning here.\nGuess you go where your roots are.\n\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: summoner guild\nCc: airborne, wilbie, sauron\nDate: Nov 19\n\n\nAs far as i know, the summoner guild is fully operational, and could \nprovide a quick dose of much needed entertainment around here.\nI need some fun guilds to sell.\n\nI am recruiting a bunch of players\n\nRealms had a REALLY EVIL civil war over the last 9 weeks.\nThe mud was copied and opened by disgruntled wizards on another site.\nhalf the wizards left, 2/3rds of the players left.  Anyway, the \nRealms 2 lost its site, and most of the players won't go back to realms\n1, or old realms.  And are looking for a hoome.\nSince Animal ripped off half of holy mission when he became god on realms.\nI invited some players over. and will continue to invite them over.\nJust need to get some wizzes online more often to welcome them.\n\nI think the summoners guild was great and we should take advantage of it since\nthere are not a whole lot of players around to worry about parser hits.\n\nAlso, can the chat thing go, whats wrong with shouting and a good set of\nearmuffs.\n\nEveryone i talk to hates chat.  TOOO DIKU\n\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: wilbie\nSubj: pyramid\nDate: Nov 25\n\n\nWoo, Its a deal,  The causway will approach the pyramid from the west side, so we need to attach the  area someplace on the\nwest side of town.  Maybe a long trek through the forest and shit then through the desert\n\nYou keep the desert in your dir, and i do the pyramid, make desert large enough to add\nrandom tombs later, for a quest\n\nWooo\nI will set up write access for you\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: mangla\nSubj: ninja stuff\nCc: wilbie\nDate: Dec 15\n\n\nOkay, I have waited for a bit and observed what is left of the mud, and who\nis around to work on it.\nis around to work on it.\nThe fact is Warlord logged on once in the month of december for under 1 minute.\nSauron was on for a few minutes after a month off.\n\nAnd the ninja guild remains closed\n\nThere are still some people around who know the guild, and want to open it.\nFor the most part, It will take less than a week to open.\nThe weapons can be expanded and the island of Ishikawa can be reopened and that\nquest fixed up and reinsated.\nYou already turned down the summoner guild for reopening, a move I think would breed renewed interest in the mud. \nNo matter how badly on ethinks it is coded, You still need people to buy your commodity\nTake a look at Windows, obviously a piece of shit, that millions still buy.\nFirst priority should be to get players back.\n\nLet a few of us reopen the ninja guild.\nIt can and should remain in the patience directory, being nearly impossible\nto move. \n\nI propose Wilbie and I for the job and anyone else interested enough.\nThere has been bickering of the GM of this guild for as long as I remember\nand its been down for THREE years\n\nWe would need access to entire patience directory, need access to\nhaplo's directory as well, I have had access to haplo's since the day we wizzed.\n\nI hope I have shown that i can get things done around here, and its not just\na bunch of idle chat.\n\nTatsuo-san\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: wilbie\nFwd:  stuff\nDate: Jan 13\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: stuff\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Jan 11\n\nYou're walking on a track through the village.

We don't have.[0m\n].[33mthe wizards we once had, and we don't have any arches on regularly to get .[0m.[33mthings.[0m\n].[33minstalled, fixed and player requests attented to..[0m\n\n]].[33mInstead we have exos sexually harassing female players, and people logging.[0m\n].[33mon to read the boards..[0m\n\n]\n]].[33mI know that you think i am damaged products, and my asking to get promoted.[0m\n].[33mback to arch just a stab at former glory..[0m\n\n]].[33mI am therefore not going to do that, but someone needs to be an arch .[0m.[33maround here.[0m\n].[33mbesides just you and a few others just in name.[0m\n]\n].[33mI would ask that you make wilbie and archwizard, because he is here, he .[0m.[33mcodes, he.[0m\n].[33mis a class one computer geek, working for state industrial chemicals in .[0m.[33mcleveland.[0m\n].[33mon their mainframe, and no one distrusts him..[0m\n\n]].[33mIt is true he is my friend, but you are gonna find that all i want is this .[0m.[33mplace.[0m\n].[33mto recover.  I hope you can start placing trust in some other people or HM .[0m.[33mwill.[0m\n].[33mnever go anywhere..[0m\n\n]].[33mLike on the summoner issue, you think that it is poorly coded guild, but .[0m.[33mguess what.[0m\n].[33meveryone likes the idea of them reopening, and they functioned without error.[0m\n].[33mfor 2 years while open..[0m\n\n]].[33mWilbie and I can get the ninja guild reopened at long last.[0m\n].[33mTurbo is around to code, and could tackle a guild at this point.[0m\n]\n].[33mThe three of us and yourself are the ONLY ones coding, and If i was running .[0m.[33mthe.[0m\n].[33mmud I would make those people arches, lords, and work with them..[0m\n]\n].[33mI can tell you now, i would not, and have never done anything to sabotage the.[0m\n].[33mmud,  and i was pushed away from here for a long time for something i .[0m.[33mdidn't do..[0m\n].[33mIf i seem bitter at times, i think i have the right to express it..[0m\n]\n].[33mI am not out to erase you or anyone else, save maybe exos, who should be .[0m\n].[33mbanned if you have a talk with thumper and other people he harasses.[0m\n]\n].[33mThere is no vendetta, just a desire to make my hobby, HM, return to a semi.[0m\n].[33msuccessful mud, and preserve it for as long as those of us who are .[0m.[33minterested can.[0m\n].[33mkeep it around..[0m\n\n]].[33mGive up a little control, delegate and give access, and you will see some .[0m.[33mwonderous.[0m\n].[33mthings happen to moral.  No one here sees the prospect of advancing, so .[0m.[33mthey don't .[0m\n].[33mcode, they don't see anyone on, so they don't code.  We need a catalyst..[0m\n].[33mAnd we need adminstrators, and you know, I was entrusted with it once, and .[0m.[33mI didn't.[0m\n].[33mbetray that trust, and still I am labeled as potential enemy of the state..[0m\n].[33mAt the least, make wilbie into an archwizard so things can get done..[0m\n\n]].[33mAt the best,  Promote all the active coders, open up access, and delegate..[0m\n].[33mDiscuss ideas, instead of ruling on them, and invite in some coders from the.[0m\n].[33mpast,  Saffron who needs repromoted to wiz and her password set, is .[0m.[33minterested.[0m\n].[33min coding again.

He said that you show only Good for Hm desire and\nnot Promo desire.  I said promoting wilbie is Good for HM\nAnd told him repeatly its not your way to ask for those things.\n\nDO ME A FAVOR, ASK HIM for an elder promo, and a guild.\nI am trying to get the summoner reopened as IS. cause it works, and we need\nall the guilds we can get.

I have layed out many reasons why i want to be arch\nand i am consistantly put off and ignored.  The arches want to do everything behind \nclosed doors.  I am sending this letter to Mangla, who of all the arches, is the\nonly one that codes, and has been here, and who has admittedly pointed out that\nhe forgets things, and misses things, because of everything that needs done.\n\nCoding for HM is something that I enjoy to the fullest, but it has not been fun.\nAt every turn I have an archwizard speaking down at me, lying about me or at\nleast continuing an untrue rumor to others, THIS IS LOGGED, I have sent it to \nmangla.  We have archwizards who last coded 5 years ago.  We have archwizards\nwith outside commitments that take up space here.  We have archwizards that\ntake off 5 months and turn up like messiahs reasserting their rightful positions\nand casting down judgements. And we have one coding arch.\n\nFor 3 and one half years I watched the mud go through death throws, as players\nand wizards were driven off by shitty policies, guild closings, and the mud\nbeing moved around( all reasons I have heard).  Sauron, of the beloved\nninja guild had 3.5 years to recode ninja, he also had 3.5 years to\nput the monk into a bin system, and do something to balance it.  It just wasn't\ndone.  I do not know what he has done, but i can only speak of what wasn't done,\nand ask if opening and fixing these guilds was less important that what was done.\n\nThere was plenty of time for these people to \"shit or get off the pot\".\nIt wasn't done.  For those of you who do not know, or who have prescribed to\nthe rumors that abound.  I was banned by mistake.  I was kept away and put\noff without reason.  Untrustworty was heard. All sorts of things.\nFor the brief time i was unbanned, i was NEVER returned to my position,\nalthough it was a mistake that i lost it.  I was kept and treated as\na wiz with suspicion, and comments being made about me.  It sucked.\n\nI was restored to my position.  Airborne said it was a check on Mangla.\nMangla said it was to bring back HM.  Silas voted for me cause i asked him.\nIn the time that i made elder, I restored the ninja with wilbie, tinman,\nand bobo, restored the summoners with redsexy.  recruited and set up\n7 new Gm's, reviewed and opened 5 areas, coded a clan system, and fixed\n2 whole areas.  There is much more that needs done.  And i log on every\nday to find some social archwizard speaking down from above.  Or active\nones talking down about me or to me.  Telling me what is wrong with me, \nand refusing to listen to all the facts established about what is wrong\nwith what they have done.  I have done archwizard work.  I was an archwizard.\nI have used elder position to help everyone on here, even the assholes.\n\nMany other wizards have been inspired to come back, but that momentum is dying.\nThey have been put off, forgotten, while the ALL important archwizards\nsit back for a month to discuss things.  Redsexy was ignored for a year.\nHer area forgotten.  Bobo has done more coding than any other person\nat his rank, he is ignored and put off.  I don't blame him for cutting back.\nThere are wizards that are banished and wanted to come back, but they are\nignored.  And Exos is still here even after the testimony of 7 or 8 people\nattested to his absolute wrongdoings.\n\nAfter the ninja guild was restored, players and wizards started calling for\nnew archwizards with my name being mentioned many times.  These people were\ntold point blank to shut the hell up.  I have no conception of what\nyou arches have going on in that little room, and what bullshit ideas are\nfloating around.  But face it. One coding arch, isn't going to cut it.\nThe mud blew up in sargons workroom, understandings were reached, Then ignored.\nThat Tuesday came and went a month ago.  The old ways are no longer needed.\nWho is gonna help you put in the 100 level system? Airborne? Silas?\nKryll?, maybe Warlord and Uglymoth.  Maybe Sauron when he comes back from\nhis next extended vacation.  Hello, Tatsuo has the ability, and has shown it.\nThe mantras of me being some evil son of a bitch won't work forever when\nthey are demonstrably untrue.  You know what Redsexy is right, I am BOTH.\n\nI cannot fathom the resistance to the move when everything points to a positive.\nWhen there is a chance to remove the dead weight and move up the people\nthat are bringing back the players.  The momentum as you put it is starting to slip\nwith the players.  I can spark it back up.  I will claim responsibility\nfor a large percent of the comeback that is started.  I give the rest to the\npeople who have been ignored and put off.  From what i know, there are\npotentially 3 mudlib level coders on the game besides you Mangla.\nThose are your archwizards.\nTatsuo, Wilbie, and Sargon.\n\nPlease stop bogarting the highest position in the game when others can fill \nthose positions.  calling kryll to login hasn't made him come back and fix the\nplace. and saurons instant appearance also has done little but piss me off.\nPut the level where the level belongs.  With the people that code this place,\nand enjoy it.\n\nYou want the 100 level system in, arch those people.\nYou want the guilds running and balanced, arch those people.\nYou want players coming back, arch those people.\nYou want new players, arch those people.\nYou want wizards coding and being helped with code, arch those people.\nYou want Holy Mission back, arch those people.\n\nIf you want things the way they were. Sit back and dicuss things some more with\nthe deadbeats that brought her down.\nMake some changes, shake the boat. Take action, make it fun.\nIf not, I am outta here.  \n\nI have forwarded this to every wiz that gives a damn, and i will ask that\nthese wizzes write their feelings to MANGLA and cc it to TATSUO.  I want\na clean and open debate.  I also ask that it not be sent to other arches\nwhose feelings may be hurt by it.  That is not my intention.  I i have\nspoken an untruth, let it be known.  If i am right, tell mangla to fix the\nplace.\n\nTatsuo, for Holy Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: redsexy\nFwd:  mail\nCc: bobo, uruz, waldo, wilbie, tinman, thumper\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: mail\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nI recently reseved a letter that had some stronge statements made in it.\nOdds are you know the one I am talking about. We stand at a cross roads,\nit is no secret that this mud is dead, but there is hope. Recently the old\ncoders have returned, and with them some new players. This mud can be\ngreat once again. \"These are the time that try mens souls\" Henry V. I\nsay that because people don't seem to like change, it seems to try there\nsouls. Well its time to put the games aside and start to do what is best\nfor the mud. Tatsuo has shown that he can get things done. Why then do\nwe not let him do this. The answer would seem to be with the arches. I have\nno clue what you guys do, but I see what you don't do, and this is help\nthis place. We need new arches and new changes to be made. I FULLY suport\nthe ideas set forth by Tatsuo and some of the others wizes.

When we bump into each other, he converses with me. I constantly see him on here and he has never EVER said anything like \"Well hold on. I'm busy.\"\nLike I said, I'm totally new to MUDding.

And if all the other Archwizzes made it what it is today, I'm sure those two can help make it what it will be tomorrow.\nPsi.\n\n**\ntatsuo\n**\nTo: redsexy\nFwd:  Tatsuo\nCc: sargon, wilbie, akira, uruz, bobo, shadowmonk, thumper\nDate: Mar 22\n\nTo: mangla\nSubj: Tatsuo\nCc: tatsuo\nDate: Mar 22\n\nI think what tatsuo says is true.  the mud died because of all the changes\nand being a arch here you have responsibility.  And people who lack the\nresponsibility should be taken off arch immediately.  Once people see\nhow great hm was and what it really was.  I can even say i left hm because\nof lack of work being done and no one gives a damn about the mud but Tatsuo\ncan make a difference.  He made me realized the mud can change.  Therefore\ni have help him with the ninja guild.  He show me many things that can\nbe added to improve hm.  I say why don't we just give tatsuo a try.  \nare you afraid of him??  if so, you can watch him and see his ability\nto work. you will find your suspiouicans are wrong.  This mud will die\nagain and make all the people here lost hope if nothing is being done.\nI have talk to a few people about hm.  they say the arch doesn't care\nabout the mud anymore and at the moment they have saw tatsuo making\nchanges which made people come back.  and actually take a look at this place.\nLet us not neglect hm again.  Give Tatsuo the arch position.\n\nTinman\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: wilbie\nSubj: Graveyard\nCc: sauron airborne\nDate: Mar 26\n\nI had to edit the monsters in your graveyard to remove\nthe walk. There is a bug in the clone_list that meant\nyou had ALOT of monsters running around in there and\nit was begining to get to the mud I think. Not saying\nno more moving monster, but give us a chance to fix the\nclone_list. :)\n\nThanks,\n--Mangla\n\n**\nnae\n**\nTo: wilbie\nRe:   Strike\nCc: redsext,  sargon, shadowmonk, nae, bobo, nunu, turbo, tinman, thumper, akira, nylakoorub\nDate: Mar 27\n\njesus christ, this is such crap. \ni'm sorry, i try to stay out of politics, but tatsuo has\nmanaged to brainwash people. so here's the deal, as far\nas i'm concerned.\n\ni'm gonna keep doing what i'm doing. coding, enjoying the\nmud. it's a GAME!!!!!!! i have fun here.\n\nif you want to leave, then be my guest... *shurg* but\na strike??? WHO FUCKING CARES????\n\njesus, maybe i shouldnt mail when i'm drunk. but this is just\nsuch crap... whining about shit that tatsuo obviously has no clue about.\n\nwilbie, and whoever else supports this strike... i have a suggestion for\nya- go on strike. turn off your machine, get out into the world,\nand realize that there's more to it than this game. cause\nthis game doesnt mean a damn thing.\n\nnae\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: wilbie\nSubj: strike list\nDate: Mar 27\n\nWas there a reason Exos was excluded?\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: wilbie\nSubj: ARCHes.\nDate: Mar 27\n\nWhy have you not let them know?\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: wilbie\nSubj: Exos\nDate: Mar 29\n\nI also have a tendancy to oppose anthing that involes Tatsuo.\nThis was NOT something I learned from Exos.\nGAGE excluded him for a reason.  \nAll the information I judge him on either comes from observing or\nfrom Chris Myers.  \n\nIf 6 different females have complained, why have they not gone public?\n\nTatsuo has a wonderful tendency of stepping on the fingers of anyone below him \nif he doesn't do it, someone else should, because he said it needed done.\n\nAm I to believe EVERYONE here has done a poor job?\nOr just Mangla.\n\nBTW, you may have already found this out, but Magnal is a test-character of sorts.\nMangla uses it.\n\nI posted your strike mail on the board because I was asked to.\n\n**\nturbo\n**\nTo: wilbie\nSubj: falling apart?\nDate: Mar 29\n\nThis mud is as life-like as its gonna get.\nDave cant change that, Exos cant change that.  Mangla cant change that.\nWe had our days of glory.  They are gone.  \nYes, I miss them, but nothing can bring them back.\n\n**\nnae\n**\nTo: wilbie\nRe:   strike\nCc:  nae, turbo, bobo, nunu, redsexy, akira\nDate: Mar 30\n\nYes, we ARE friends. But I'm sorry, I'm not a sheep.\n*I* don't agree with you that the arches are dictators.\n*I* dont agree that they're ruining the mud.\nI happen to think that the best way we can make the\nmud better is to all work together... which is CLEARLY\nnot what you were asking for.\n\nI'm sorry. If you open a discussion, and call for\nresponses, dont act like it's the end of the world\nwhen they dont agree with you.\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: wilbie\nSubj: Great deal!\nCc: sauron\nDate: Apr 12\n\nWe are working on things and are willing to compromise.\nTo get onto the test site 208.246.88.199 4242 and\nlogin with your password being 'ddrree'. Start taking a\nlook around and geting used to some of the changes, they\ncan throw you for a loop.\n\nWe are working on getting a complete zip of the /players\ndir ro place over there, but that might take a few days.\nOther than that, we will be having all wizard zip thier\nown dirs up and I will be unzipping and placing over there.\nI will be leaving Wednesday and be out a week, but sauron\nwill be around to help with whatever is needed over that\ntime.\n\nGlad to have you back on board, lets make it a good one!\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\nmangla\n**\nTo: wilbie\nSubj: files\nCc: sauron\nDate: Apr 12\n\nGive us a few days to see if Herp will help. Otherwise you can\nFTP them down and zip them up on your HD and FTP the zipped\nfile up to the new server. Myself or Sauron will then take\nthat file and unzip it for you within a few days normally.\n\nJust ftp to the same box and you can write under the\npub/MUDFILES directory to place the zip and just let sauron and \nI know it is there.\n\n-Mangla\n\n**\n"
