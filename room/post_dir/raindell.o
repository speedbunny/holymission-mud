Haven't been on here for a while now....\nHope all's well??  Sure has been a long time since I last talked to you :)\nKeeping busy both at home and at work, where things are nuts!!  Though at home, they're also busy, as I've got my mom living with me for several months while she undergoes treatment for cancer.  \nGuess I ought to log in here more often!!!\nHope things are going well for you?\nTake care...\nSue, AKA Hakan  *smiles*\n\n**\n"
