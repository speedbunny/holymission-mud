We all know that HM is perhaps one of the most\ndifficult muds to learn to code on.  The doc files just plain suck, and \nuntil now no one was looking to change that.  I have decided to re-write \nall the doc files (I am toying with the idea of starting from scratch)\nand eventually making them available on a web site.  \n\nSince you are the best coder I have ever worked with, I thought I would\nask you if you would like to help me in this undertaking.  I know you\nmust help hundreds of coders, and getting a solid programming base\navailable to many on a web site will able you to help that many more.\nIf you have the time and feel this is something you would like to be a \npart of, please let me know.\n\nWillie\n\n**\ndworkin\n**\nTo: steerpike\nSubj: Since I missed you\nDate: Oct  6\n\nUmm.. if you fancy a laugh you could have a look at greebo.unseen.org 4000.\nIt's mike server and has a copy of a modified 2.4.5 and amylaar driver.\n\nIf you log on, let me know and I'll promote the character (unless you\nknow of a loophold to do it :) )\n\nSimon\n\n**\ndice\n**\nTo: steerpike\nSubj: E-mail\nCc: Diec\nDate: Nov  9\n\n\n]Hello ...]I was told your Original name was Moonchild here ...]If so please leave a message here or e-mail dice@euronet.nl]]]Moonchild awas an old friend of mine and i'd like to reestablich contact here :)]]Thanks in advance                        ]Hello ...]I was told your Original name was Moonchild here ...]If so please leave a message here or e-mail dice@euronet.nl]]]Moonchild awas an old friend of mine and i'd like to reestablich contact here :)]]Thanks in advance                        Hello ,.\n\nI was told your old name here was Moonchild\nIf you can you please leave mail  here or to dice@euronet.nl\nMoonchild was an old friend of mine and i't trying to reestablich contact\n\n\nThanx in advance\n\n\n\n**\ndice\n**\nTo: steerpike\nRe:   Hey!\nDate: Dec 15\n\nI actually send you a message, but i think it didn't get through\nI'm doing fine these days, got myself a new job and stuff \nLiving normally (as normal as can be with an insane attitude)\n \nHope to speak to ya soon ....\n\nGotta leave now, Gf calling :*)\n\n/Dice\n\nPierre Maijstre\n\nPS\nCan you try to send a mail to PMAIJSTRE@TELFORT.NL ???\nWwill try to reply from there\n\n\n\n**\ndanford\n**\nTo: steerpike\nSubj: yo\nDate: Apr 13\n\nHey man,\n\nEmail me (danford@looney.com) what mud and addy\nyou hang out on these days so I can come bug you.\n\n:)\n\n-D\n\n**\ndworkin\n**\nTo: steerpike\nSubj: Ey up!
