About linsolent being married and the others not (hint) well what if I was to be you and say I don't want autumn to be married now at all cuz she can't be married to linsolent! She'll just go through the rest of her mud life pouting.   just kidding! When I get a computer we'll have fun !  I also thought you were going to put up a home page about this mud and like me visiting there and ect.. what ever happened to that?  I know that this x-mas it will be 2 years. (even though it seems like yesterday) so it's old news now i know. well i better be goingnow.  I'll talk at ya later! Love ya-Amber\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n"
