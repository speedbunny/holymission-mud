                            PLAYING AS A PLAYER

Wizards are not allowed player characters. They are allowed one
testcharacter. Any other character they had as a player should be
deleted. 

Wizards may ask for Arch approval to have a player character. This
character must be treated as another player, not the wizard (ie the wizard
cannot help him/her) and should not be known to be used by the wizard. 
Neither wizards nor players should know this character is actually the
wizard.
