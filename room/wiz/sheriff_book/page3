                            PLAYER INTERACTION

Wizard and Player interaction is commonplace. However, do not give
anything to players without a VERY good reason (such as player has the
trollslayer and loses it due to a bug which you saw). Any circumstances
like this should be documented on the wiz sheriff board so an Arch or
Elder can fix the bug.
