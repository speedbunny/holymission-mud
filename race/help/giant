GIANT:

Giants are the strongest of all races. They are very tall humanoids.
Most giants are good and they love the contact to other races, like
elves or humans. Giants love to live in mountains or on hills. Their
only big disadvantage is their extremly low intelligence. Giants
use mostly big clubs, maces or twohander as weapon. They are well
known to be the best of all fighters.
