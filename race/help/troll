TROLL:

Trolls are a very evil and strong race. They are even stronger
and much taller than orcs, but have a very low intelligence.
Trolls have often the double hight of a human. Their main food
are elves, humans and half-elves. They mostly dont cook them,
they even eat them raw. Trolls have a brown bear like fur and
a mouselike nose. They live in big earth caves and mostly use
big wooden clubs for hunting. They are ideal for fighterlike
guilds.
