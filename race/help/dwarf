DWARF:

Dwarves are very small humanoids with great strength.
As the elves dwarfs dislike orcs or trolls, but they
avoid contact to the elves too. Dwarfs are strong 
bearded even females are and they are proud of it.
Dwarves have a very social habit and mostly they live in
mines. When they don't dig they are drinking beer as their
holy water. Dwarves have a very high condition but their
intelligence and charisma is mostly lower than that of 
humans. Dwarfs can nearly join any guild, but are ideal for
fighterlike guilds.
