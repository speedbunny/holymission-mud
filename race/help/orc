ORC:

Orcs are a very evil race. They are really strong and have a 
high condition even more as the Dwarves. Their food are 
elves, which they love to cook over a fire in their dark
caves. Orcs are as tall as humans, but their nose looks
piglike. Their livestyle is a bit chaotic and they ever get
what they want. Female and male orcs are very similar in their
behavier. Their main target is just to satisfy themself. Even
if avoided by nearly any race unless trolls, it's still a fact
that they are using prisoners not only for food, also to make
little half-orcs. Orcs are good to be fighter, thief or ninja.
