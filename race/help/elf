ELF:

Elves is a humanoid race, which nearly look like humans.
They are a bit smaller and weaker than humans, but have the
advantage of a high charisma and intelligence and a good. 
dexterity. Elves are very pretty. Elves are ideal to join 
guilds like mage, thief or monk. But after all an elf can
join almost any guild.
