GNOME:

Gnomes are a very funny race. They are born to be curious.
They are a bit like dwarves but don't have that big noses
and they aren't so plump. Another fact is that gnomes look
quite cute and female gnomes never get a beard. Gnomes are
well known for building all kinds of funny things. If there
is somewhere an explosion you can be sure it was a gnome.
Gnomes have a very high intelligence, even higher as an elf,
and a very high dexterity. But they can't carry much and are
very weak. Gnomes are ideal to be a mage or summoner.
