These files are basic objects which should be inherited and then altered to
reflect your requirements. Note that you should be able to inherit these,
change all the variables etc in reset() and then issue a replace_program() to
reduce memory.

Note: If you discover any bugs in these files, please go to 
/players/dworkin/workroom and leave a note on the board.
